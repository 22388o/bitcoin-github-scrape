laanwj,2015-03-18T12:06:34Z,It's more efficient if you file these with @theuni's repository on the trivial-next branch directly: https://github.com/theuni/bitcoin\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5922#issuecomment-82937712,82937712,
theuni,2015-03-19T05:29:00Z,"Yes, please do that.\n\nI'll go ahead and review/pull these (along with some others that are waiting) tomorrow, but submitting them directly to the trivial tree would be much better.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5922#issuecomment-83335571,83335571,
theuni,2015-03-20T06:27:02Z,I'm not comfortable pulling these into trivial.\n1. The authenticated/secure debate has been hashed out here before and I'm not sure how it ended up.\n2. The defaultConfirmTarget mixes a small functional change with a cosmetic one.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5922#issuecomment-83928792,83928792,
Diapolo,2015-03-20T10:40:14Z,"Feel free to just take the one commit that matches your Trivial specs :). I didn't want to start a new debate, but recently I've been using the authenticated term when dealing with payment requests and also took that from pull-request discussions, when discussing with others.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5922#issuecomment-83983737,83983737,
laanwj,2015-03-20T10:53:29Z,"> The authenticated/secure debate has been hashed out here before and I'm not sure how it ended up.\n\n""Authenticated"" is more apt. ""Insecure"" is ambiguous.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5922#issuecomment-83985261,83985261,
laanwj,2015-03-20T10:54:36Z,"Agree @cfields that functional changes, even minor ones, should not end up in the trivial branch. That could be very dangerous, even a small change can result in big bugs.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5922#issuecomment-83985408,83985408,
sandakersmann,2015-03-21T01:08:28Z,I thought there was consensus for writing bitcoin with a lower case b when we are talking about the currency.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5922#issuecomment-84214335,84214335,
Diapolo,2015-03-21T17:27:07Z,"@sandakersmann You're right and I removed that, my fault, sorry!\n@laanwj I removed the code change from that pull, you're right it doesn't belong here.\n@theuni Seems the Authenticated/Insecure change is consensus then, right :)?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5922#issuecomment-84402839,84402839,
