fanquake,2019-11-10 22:05:47,Generally we add keys after signing for two major releases. I see that [you've committed](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gitian.sigs/commits?author=TheCharlatan) unsigned sigs for 0.18.1 and 0.19.0. Are you planning on producing the signed sigs as well?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17436#issuecomment-552239876,552239876,
