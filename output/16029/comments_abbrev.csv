jonatack,2019-05-17 15:01:18,FWIW the deprecation warning this PR would remove was added more recently with https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13532 than the 2014 commit https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/60dc8e4208 mentioned in the PR description above.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16029#issuecomment-493486125,493486125,
dongcarl,2019-05-17 15:14:08,"@jonatack Right. It seems like this was effectively deprecated in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/60dc8e4208 but users would only have known about it with https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13532. Closing, but perhaps we could add a release note item about the deprecation so more people know about it in case we decide to remove it in the future.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16029#issuecomment-493490714,493490714,
