laanwj,2017-07-18T06:34:45Z,"IMO, errors does not need to be duplicated on every `get*info` call. It's fine to have it on only one.\n\nAlso, ""warnings"" is a better name. None of the messages are really errors, all of them are advisory. Errors result in a node abort. This is why the old name (on the deprecated getinfo) is ""errors"" and the new one (on getnetworkinfo) is named ""warnings"".\n(having it on getmininginfo is weird",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10858#issuecomment-315971368,315971368,

jnewbery,2017-09-01T19:48:48Z,"I think we can be more aggressive in improving and harmonizing RPCs, as long as we give plenty of warning and time for clients to upgrade.

jnewbery,2017-09-19T13:41:03Z,"@achow101 - do you disagree with changing RPCs in general? I think we need to have some way of evolving the API over releases otherwise mistakes made in the past are set in stone forever.\n\nIf you do agree that the API needs to change over releases, can you suggest a better, safer way of doing it than making the versioning configurable with a command line option?

achow101,2017-09-19T13:55:07Z,@jnewbery I agree that the API should change. However I don't think that we should give each deprecated thing its own command line argument to enable or disable it. I think we could do some sort of versioning with different endpoints like what multiwallet does with multiple wallets.
