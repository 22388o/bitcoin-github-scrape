I was thinking about the cleanest way to reach the GUI or the shortest as IMHO it would be cool to replace local message boxes with just emit message(). Can you describe the general flow that you think is best.\n\nMy idea was we nearly have the walletmodel available in every view or dialog and it has a message() connection to the GUI...\,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3161#discussion_r7236285,7236285,src/qt/sendcoinsdialog.cpp

An object has the responsibility for what its signals mean and when they are emitted, so another object should not be subscribing its signals to anything.\n(yes, I know this is broken somewhat in WalletView as well by passing in the gui object and then subscribing it to various signals, which is weird, but let'",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3161#discussion_r7236326,7236326,src/qt/sendcoinsdialog.cpp
