sdaftuar,2016-03-01T22:12:47Z,Motivation?  Curious whether whatever you're using this for should be using descendant fee rate or ancestor fee rate (see #7594)...\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7629#issuecomment-190930300,190930300,
pstratem,2016-03-01T22:17:51Z,@sdaftuar the motivation is two part\n\nfirst to ensure mempool walks are in an order which avoids any orphans\n\nsecond to make the feefilter command more efficient in combination with the mempool p2p command\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7629#issuecomment-190932156,190932156,
pstratem,2016-03-01T22:33:45Z,@sdaftuar is right this should be using ancestor indexing\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7629#issuecomment-190938025,190938025,
sipa,2016-03-05T05:13:52Z,@pstratem Can you elaborate? How does this guarantee the avoidance of orphans? Transaction descendants can have both higher or lower feerate than the parent.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7629#issuecomment-192576743,192576743,
pstratem,2016-03-05T08:21:27Z,@sipa it doesn't i mis understood what was being indexed.\n\ni'll fix this properly later\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7629#issuecomment-192606849,192606849,
