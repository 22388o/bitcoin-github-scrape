MarcoFalke,2016-03-24T14:20:48Z,Also it looks like you forgot to add the documentation [here](https://github.com/jonasschnelli/bitcoin/blob/df80f3d097984fa3b5b31be9ed86d2b489dcb5ec/src/wallet/rpcwallet.cpp#L1441)?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7707#discussion_r57322803,57322803,src/wallet/rpcwallet.cpp
jonasschnelli,2016-04-04T07:24:45Z,It's already optimized and the source SVG is not required because it's part of Hutchings typicons (we only added sourced for manipulated or self-created icons).\nAlso `src/qt/res/icons/transaction*.png` covers the copyright info in `contrib/debian/copyright`.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7707#discussion_r58336771,58336771,src/Makefile.qt.include
