JeremyRubin,2020-03-03 01:06:32, Dismaying but I noticed another flaw here; I don't think we ever check if the direct children of a transaction are in the cache. I'll fix this in the follow up PR for review there.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18120#issuecomment-593712940,593712940,

Perhaps something like:\n```\nmark every direct child as visited, so that if we encounter one of these transactions again \n(as the descendant of some other direct child), we don't re-add them to the cache.\n```",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18120#discussion_r381390270,381390270,src/txmempool.cpp
