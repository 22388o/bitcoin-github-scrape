laanwj,2012-06-14T17:01:12Z,"I'm pretty sure that providing a command line option does not change the setting in QSettings, so afaik it will not work. The code to get data for the options dialog reflects the current setting in the Qt settings, not the option actually in use in the core. \n\nWe should at last test it.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1453#discussion_r986374,986374,src/qt/optionsmodel.cpp
Diapolo,2012-06-14T17:08:01Z,"You are right, providing it per command-line won't change it in the options, but as this is for the GUI client, we can be sure that OptionsModel::Init() was called, which leads to to a consistent state, right?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1453#discussion_r986419,986419,src/qt/optionsmodel.cpp
laanwj,2012-06-14T17:19:40Z,"No. Look again. OptionsModel::Init does not change the QSettings. It sets command-line options (using SoftSetArg) _based on_ the QSettings, not the other way around.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1453#discussion_r986546,986546,src/qt/optionsmodel.cpp
TheBlueMatt,2012-06-14T17:22:20Z,"Then that is another bug, the qt options dialog should, at least, show the current settings.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1453#discussion_r986577,986577,src/qt/optionsmodel.cpp
Diapolo,2012-06-14T17:27:05Z,"This really seems like a bug then, as the comment in optionsdialog.cpp reads:\n\n<pre>    // These are shared with core Bitcoin; we want\n    // command-line options to override the GUI settings:</pre>\n\n\nCommand-line options should permanently SET GUI options.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1453#discussion_r986636,986636,src/qt/optionsmodel.cpp
laanwj,2012-06-14T17:34:08Z,"Maybe. I think we decided against that last time, and let command-line options temporarily override GUI options. Anyway, this is not the place for that discussion.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1453#discussion_r986697,986697,src/qt/optionsmodel.cpp
TheBlueMatt,2012-06-14T17:46:25Z,"I agree the gui settings shouldnt be permanently set by cli flags, but if you set a setting by a cli flag, the gui should show that setting, and if you change it in the gui thereafter, it should change and be set.  Id say thats by far the least surprising behavior.  \n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1453#discussion_r986800,986800,src/qt/optionsmodel.cpp
Diapolo,2012-06-14T17:51:52Z,"... and the most complicated to implement. As the Apply and OK button need to be active then and somehow we need an info message that cli options have overridden the GUI settings. Last comment in this, perhaps one should open an issue to track this.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1453#discussion_r986866,986866,src/qt/optionsmodel.cpp
TheBlueMatt,2012-06-14T17:55:16Z,"Actually the easiest.  You dont need to bother informing the user, as they did it.

laanwj,2012-06-15T05:49:32Z,"Right, I've tested it. This works right for the proxy address, but not for the ""proxy use"" checkbox. OptionsModel::data confirms this; ProxyIP/ProxyPort query the actual state of the core with GetProxy, whereas ProxyUse and ProxySocksVersion return data from the settings (which may be ""behind"" the command line setting).
