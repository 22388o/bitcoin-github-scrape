After all, unsigned integer overflow isn't UB and completely normal in cryptography and other bit manipulation code.\r\n\r\nIn fairness it is probably worth mentioning that the goal of the UBSan's `unsigned-integer-overflow` is not to catch UB: as you correctly point out there is no UB to catch when it comes to unsigned integers :)\r\n\r\nThe idea is instead to make reliance on wraparound semantics explicit by documenting in which areas of our code code we expect unsigned integer wraparounds to occur (such as in `crypto/*`).\r\n\r\nUBSan can then flag all wraparounds outside of the expected areas: such cases are are likely unintentional (bugs).\r\n\r\nAlso, it should be noted that the list of `unsigned-integer-overflow` suppressions in `test/sanitizer_suppressions/ubsan` has remained largely static over time which suggests that this UBSan check is a very cheap way to kill this bug class (unintended unsigned integer wraparounds).",
