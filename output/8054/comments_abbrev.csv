gmaxwell,2016-07-13T03:00:11Z,No amount of simple testing would turn up the problems with this; if you'd like to argue that we need better test harnesses... I'd agree. Patches accepted!\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8054#issuecomment-232241511,232241511,
MarcoFalke,2016-07-13T08:36:21Z,"@rebroad You are welcome to help with testing: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin#testing\n\nAlso note, that `master` is not  considered stable. Pull request get merged after they received some review, but it is impossible to detect all issues which might arise in the future. Whenever a pull received enough review, merging it into master is a good way to expose the patch to a larger group of devel",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8054#issuecomment-232292681,232292681,
laanwj,2016-07-18T07:13:36Z,"Agree with @MarcoFalke. If you can't handle things breaking here and there momentarily, you certainly shouldn't be using the master branch.\nThese things happen, and posting here complaining months after the fact is just sad.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8054#issuecomment-233251841,233251841,
rebroad,2016-07-31T16:36:11Z,@laanwj Thanks for the clarification. I think it could be made clearer somewhere that the master branch is largely untested - I had assumed that some effort was made to test things before they were merged - it certainly used to be the case.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8054#issuecomment-236440214,236440214,
sipa,2016-07-31T16:39:44Z,Of course things are tested before merge. But we can't test everything.\nThat is why release candidates and releases exist: to give external people\na chance to test code before we label it ready to be used by everyone.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8054#issuecomment-236440405,236440405,
