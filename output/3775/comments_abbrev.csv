int03h,2014-03-02T02:30:04Z,NACK.  (if I may)\n\nAs I understand it that line builds all of them. Not just linux. There is a comment about 3 lines up that says that but I agree the script it is calling is misleadingly named. \n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3775#issuecomment-36443997,36443997,
Michagogo,2014-03-02T06:38:31Z,"@int03h Uh, I'm not sure exactly what you're saying. Have you ever done a gitian build? The gsign script signs whatever was just built. Right now, Linux and Windows builds are done separately. You can tell by the names of the descriptors. Right now the $VERSION-win dir is the signature for the Windows build, and $VERSION is the Linux build. This just makes it clear.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3775#issuecomment-36447660,36447660,
