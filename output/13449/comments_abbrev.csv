sipa,2018-06-12T18:30:10Z,"Concept ACK, though a significant part of the sign/combine logic is being changed in #13425.\n\nOne possibility is only supporting these large multisig using PSBT, and not through the existing partial raw transactions interface. That should be very simple to write, but more restrictive.\n\nOtherwise, the code for extracting existing signatures from a partial raw transaction into a key/sig map ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13449#issuecomment-396689389,396689389,

sipa,2018-08-04T00:23:27Z,"@luke-jr Interesting! Reading that BIP, I believe the n-of-n template suggested there is incorrect.
