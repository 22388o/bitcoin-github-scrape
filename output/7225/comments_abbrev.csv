fanquake,2015-12-26T00:27:54Z,"Concept ACK. If we're going to remove this call can we also drop the `CheckBlockHeader` call inside `CheckBlock` ? \n\nAs the comment in `CheckBlock` states, the call is mostly redundant with the call in `AcceptBlockHeader`. With this change, we only reach `CheckBlock` after calling `AcceptBlock`, which calls `AcceptBlockHeader`, which has called `CheckBlockHeader`.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7225#issuecomment-167268383,167268383,
