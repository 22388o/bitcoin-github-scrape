    "body": "@gmaxwell thanks for the explanation. I notice that the addresses advertised via 3rd parties go into the same database as the \"last heard from a peer database\" with fake times ranging from 3 to 7 days... why the need to fake anything - why not simply keep a database of nodes actually heard from, and a database of rumored nodes?\n",

    "body": "@rebroad The new table is a database of rumored nodes, the tried table is a database of nodes that we have heard from or nodes that we have made an outgoing connection to.\n\nThe PR #8594 changes the tried table to just be a database of nodes which we have connected to. \n\nOne idea could be to have three tables: new, tried, heard. I think this is a good idea but it requires careful design to insure it could not be manipulated by an attacker attempting to partition or eclipse a node.\n",
