EthanHeilman,2016-09-06T15:03:12Z,@gmaxwell utACK. Feeler connections don't currently send addr messages so they would not benefit from this change. I think that is ok for now.\n\nI plan on investigating the benefits of having feeler connections either send an addr message containing only themselves (if they accept incoming connections) or having feeler connections send a full addr message but that goes beyond the scope of this PR,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8661#issuecomment-244979756,244979756,
gmaxwell,2016-09-06T20:28:10Z,"I think there would be a good argument for feeler connections going as far as trying to determine if the peers have distinct chaintips-- and attempting to sync them if they do-- before moving along. But right, orthogonal to this.  Thanks for taking a look.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8661#issuecomment-245079965,245079965,

gmaxwell,2016-09-15T16:25:57Z,"@rebroad The node keeps track of when it last heard from a peer and uses this information when trying to figure out who to connect to (esp when connected to no one). Advertisements rumored through third parties have that time artificially increased, because we're getting the information second hand and it might not be correct. But when a peer advertises themselves this information is first hand. \",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8661#issuecomment-247378501,247378501,

I notice that the addresses advertised via 3rd parties go into the same database as the ""last heard from a peer database"" with fake times ranging from 3 to 7 days... why the need to fake anything - why not simply keep a database of nodes actually heard from, and a database of rumored nodes?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8661#issuecomment-249181568,249181568,
