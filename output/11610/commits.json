If it\n+doesn't, and if we still haven't heard about a block with sufficient work after a 20 minute timeout, then we send\n+a single getheaders message, and wait 2 more minutes. If after two minutes their best known block has insufficient\n+work, we disconnect that peer. We protect 4 of our outbound peers from being disconnected by this logic to prevent\n+excessive network topology changes as a result of this algorithm, while still ensuring that we have a reasonable\n+number of nodes not known to be on bogus chains.\n+\n+- Outbound (non-manual) peers that serve us block headers that are already known to be invalid (other than compact\n+block announcements, because BIP 152 explicitly permits nodes to relay compact blocks before fully validating them)\n+will now be disconnected.\n+\n+- If the chain tip has not been advanced for over 30 minutes, we now assume the tip may be stale and will try to connect\n+to an additional outbound peer. A periodic check ensures that if this extra peer connection is in use, we will disconnect\n+the peer that least recently announced a new block.\n+\n+- The set of all known invalid-themselves blocks (i.e. blocks which we attempted to connect but which were found to be\n+invalid) are now tracked and used to check if new headers build on an invalid chain.
