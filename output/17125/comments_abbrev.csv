laanwj,2019-10-14 09:55:45,FWIW the historical reason for this is that there was some Qt 4.x version that didn't support placeholder text in the `.ui` file. Support for Qt4 was dropped ages ago so this is not a concern anymore. Feel free to simply add it in the ui file.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17125#discussion_r334405023,334405023,src/qt/signverifymessagedialog.cpp
