    "body": "@rebroad On the topic of \"super pull requests\": Take a look at #6265, which is without doubt useful and should have been merged. However, there was too much code and it was impossible to review and make sure that our quality standards are met. Keep in mind that more code increases the likelihood of merge conflicts, which need to be solved and thus invalidate any review that was done up to this point.\n\nUsually it makes sense to split pull requests into topics (we use labels to indicate different modules, etc) and then make clear what the motivation for the pull is and include it in the pull request. E.g. 8501 introduces a new module and exposes some data on the rpc interface. 8550 builds on top of that and introduces new functionality to the gui.\n\nFor your \"granular debug\" pull request(s), often, the motivation for individual commits is not clear and it could be argued (by some) that the exact opposite of what the commit tries to achieve should be done. Trivial commits which will result in a lot of discussion but do not solve an open issue (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues) are usually considered waste of review time and the pulls will be closed.\n\nAlso, seeing a bunch of \"debug <some number>\" pulls being opened and then some of them fail the travis compile step (which indicates you most likely didn't try to compile them on your own)  does not help to attract reviewers.\n",
