I'd still without hesitation recommend to every newcomer to carefully read the included `doc`s as early as possible (at the very least `developer-notes.md` and `productivity.md`), as common denominator of contributor-agreed best practices and tips, that are less likely to get outdated than articles maintained by single individuals. To sum up my view: as long as we _have_ documents like `productivity.md` included in the repository, they should also include basics about how to fetch and checkout pull requests.",
