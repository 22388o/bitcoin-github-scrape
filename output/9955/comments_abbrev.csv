sdaftuar,2017-03-09T01:59:33Z,"> Maybe transactions with a witness should not get inserted into the mempool?\n\n@JeremyRubin Sure, and miners could also continue to use 0.13.0 or older for `getblocktemplate` (while submitting their blocks to later version software, which would work just fine post-segwit activation).  Many working configurations are possible; I think we're just trying to add a simple way to support more miners",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9955#issuecomment-285231227,285231227,

gmaxwell,2017-03-12T06:02:40Z,"ACK.\n\nHad to go refresh myself on the proper meaning of the ""!' prefix. Perhaps the documentation (e.g. BIPs) should be updated to give that a name, ""Mandatory prefix"". BIP 145 also needs a clear and direct call out to the extensions established in BIP9, not after it's already using them.  Otherwise it's easily confusing. :)",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9955#issuecomment-285924600,285924600,
