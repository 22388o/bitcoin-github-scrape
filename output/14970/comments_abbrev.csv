jonasschnelli,2018-12-16T06:10:55Z,I can't see any prior contribution to this project by @Emzy. I suggest only adding DNS seeds from long term contributors.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14970#issuecomment-447620338,447620338,
luke-jr,2018-12-16T06:40:14Z,"I don't think code contributors should necessarily overlap with service contributors. In fact, it may be a positive thing to have at least one or two seeds run by non-developers. Regardless, we've had such in the past, and adding this new requirement seems like a topic for a PR to the policy document.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14970#issuecomment-447621406,447621406,
laanwj,2018-12-17T18:40:43Z,The DNS seed seems to be working. Tried querying it and the addresses I got back were connectable.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14970#issuecomment-447952648,447952648,
TheBlueMatt,2018-12-20T17:01:05Z,"I've at least met @Emzy in person a few times, for whatever small amount that's worth.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14970#issuecomment-449066586,449066586,
sipa,2018-12-27T18:29:27Z,Concept ACK. I think it's generally better to have more separately-run seeders. I've also met @Emzy in person.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14970#issuecomment-450205696,450205696,
laanwj,2019-01-02T10:55:27Z,Ok I think we should probably do this then.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14970#issuecomment-450835115,450835115,
