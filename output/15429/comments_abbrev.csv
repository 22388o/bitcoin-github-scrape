moneyball,2019-02-21T01:10:42Z,ACK a083f75 . Matches output on my node as well. I ran the commands that @fanquake posted above and verified those #s matched what is in the commit. I'm not familiar enough with the system to ensure anything else needs to be verified but at least these numbers match.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15429#issuecomment-465820570,465820570,
