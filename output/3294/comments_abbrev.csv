sipa,2013-11-22T12:31:38Z,I think overloading the meaning of that setgenerate argument for regtest is ugly.\n\nCan't we move that functionality to an additional argument? Ideally there are as few explicit checks for what network we're working on in the code itself.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3294#issuecomment-29069092,29069092,

That isn't actually how it is implemented, of course (blocks are found so quickly the N threads would stomp on each other's blocks)...\n\nI'm normally sympathetic to ""makes R",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3294#issuecomment-29119945,29119945,
