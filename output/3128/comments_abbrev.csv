gavinandresen,2013-10-23T01:58:16Z,"Do we need both TX_NULL and TX_NULL_DATA? Seems to me it should just be TX_NULL_DATA, and supporting that would (I think) be a one-line change:\n\n```\nmTemplates.insert(make_pair(TX_NULL_DATA, CScript() << OP_RETURN));\n```\n\nIf we ever write higher-level code that extracts the data from a TX_NULL_DATA, that should be trivial-- remove the first byte/opcode from the ScriptPubKey, execute whatever",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3128#issuecomment-26875366,26875366,

jgarzik,2013-10-23T02:02:39Z,"@gavinandresen Regardless of map/multimap, I had the same thought.  TX_NULL_DATA can be defined as OP_RETURN, with optional trailing pushdata <= 80 bytes.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3128#issuecomment-26875522,26875522,
petertodd,2013-10-23T10:48:03Z,"Well if we want to do that it'll need a separate code path in Solver(), similar to how P2SH is handled specially. I think you can make a (weak) argument that NULL and NULL_DATA make lives a little easier, because you always know that only the latter has data that your app should try to parse. (remember that it's legal to make a zero-byte PUSHDATA with 0x00)\n\nYou know, it's unfortunate that Satos",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3128#issuecomment-26895529,26895529,
