Sjors,2019-11-05 13:42:40,"From the earlier comment:\n>  Some of the unused `spk_man` variables in the warnings are used later in 07e0c23 from #17261 for locking `cs_keystore`\n\nYou could add a function `void RequireLegacyScriptPubKeyMan()` that only serves to check the presence. That in turn can call `GetLegacyScriptPubKeyMan()`. Later commits can then switch `RequireLegacyScriptPubKeyMan()` to  `GetLegacyScriptPubKeyM",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17377#issuecomment-549827504,549827504,
