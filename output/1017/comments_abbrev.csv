The only thing I removed was the ""balance plus tx fee"" column, and replaced it with ""balance of group"".  The ""plus tx fee"" isn't particularly useful because the fee changes depending on transaction size and input age.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1017#issuecomment-4873538,4873538,
