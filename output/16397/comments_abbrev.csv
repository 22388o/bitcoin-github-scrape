stevenroose,2019-09-27 11:49:18,"@meshcollider I think the main purpose of the second part of the explanation is that there are other requirements for solvability that include pubkeys and scripts. I'm not sure how wide-spread it is, but I generally use input script and output script as synonyms for resp. scriptSig's and scriptPubKey's. And sure in the p2sh case there's kinda two output scripts going on of which one is just a hash",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16397#issuecomment-535906827,535906827,
