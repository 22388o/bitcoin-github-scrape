Empact,2018-06-11T05:50:38Z,"utACK f6f8026 - at this point `pindexState == pindex`, if e.g. `chainActive.Height() == 10` and `nCheckDepth == 1`, `pindex` should break at height 9 (`<=`) rather than 8 (`<`).\n\nOne thing throwing me off about this method: looks like reporting doesn't work if `nCheckLevel < 3`, because `pindexState` is always `chainActive.Tip()`. Is that right?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13428#issuecomment-396129295,396129295,
kallewoof,2018-06-11T06:05:37Z,"Yeah, that clearly looks wrong. The report at the end will say 'last 0 blocks'... hm.\n\nEdit: see #13431 for fix.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13428#issuecomment-396131717,396131717,
