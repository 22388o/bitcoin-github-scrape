fanquake,2019-11-20 15:29:07,What is actually failing with `-Werror=unused-variable`? I can build depends and configure master (76e777df83db4fc14d5cf96c67ceaa554a016a3a) with `--enable-werror` and I'm not seeing any issues.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17533#issuecomment-556055006,556055006,
MarcoFalke,2019-11-20 16:17:01,"@fanquake It depends on what libraries your system comes with. E.g. it fails when your system ships a ""broken"" boost: https://travis-ci.org/bitcoin/bitcoin/jobs/613924094#L10291",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17533#issuecomment-556080193,556080193,
fanquake,2019-11-20 16:44:14,"@MarcoFalke Right, but that failure isn't using system Boost, it's building Boost from depends. So are we assuming that builds for people using `master` and system libraries are also currently failing when using `--enable-werror`? It would be good to get some examples.\n\nThe problem this PR is ""fixing"", which is unclear from the description, is that 15382 introduces a dependency on Boost Proces",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17533#issuecomment-556092676,556092676,

Sjors,2019-11-21 17:23:16,"In my experience it only failed on a PR that started using a previously unused part of Boost #15382. We could of course leave this PR open until it actually breaks something on Travis. Maybe #14920 is merged before that's needed.\n\n> Right, but that failure isn't using system Boost, it's building Boost from depends.\n\nI can also produce that failure with system Boost in that PR, but only 1.7",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17533#issuecomment-557187819,557187819,

fanquake,2020-01-05 04:36:20,"Going to close this. If this change is required by a PR (#15382), it should be included in that PR (looks like it is), rather than applied to the build system in advance. Also see my comment above; https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17533#issuecomment-556092676. #15382 could also be taking other approaches, like at least patching boost process in depends, rather than reverting a good, project",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17533#issuecomment-570856902,570856902,
