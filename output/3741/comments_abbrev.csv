Michagogo,2014-02-25T11:11:56Z,"Personally, I don't think this change is a good idea. There are reasons why one might want to have this information. If you're worried about it, perhaps add an option to control it. It could even be off by default, but I don't want to make it impossible.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3741#issuecomment-35997271,35997271,
laanwj,2014-02-25T11:20:50Z,"You removed not only the IP adress but also the subversion. The version is very useful to know when a strange transaction comes in.\n\nAll in all, I think this makes little sense. Are you afraid of people logging IPs? Well, the people that want to log IPs can simply patch the source code to do so. Or use a sniffing tool. Some sites such as blockchain.info will already log your IP (see the sad stor",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3741#issuecomment-35997869,35997869,
luke-jr,2014-02-25T18:17:02Z,"@laanwj Historically, we've had a policy (there are PRs prior to #2126 also) to not log IP addresses. The reason being, that it makes bitcoin node logs a potentially valuable resource to hack/subpoena, making a hassle for users. If an individual wants to patch it in (or even enable an option), that's fine, but having it enabled by default is IMO a real risk.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3741#issuecomment-36039569,36039569,

laanwj,2014-02-25T19:17:05Z,I'm fine with making logging IPs an option that is off by default.\n\nBTW the respective commit ba6a4ea added IPs in various places (and there were others as well already) so it probably makes sense to generalize this and not single out this single occurence.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3741#issuecomment-36046198,36046198,
Michagogo,2014-02-25T19:18:22Z,"Well, right now this isn't implemented as an option as far as I can tell -- it just strips it out completely. I wouldn't be very opposed to having it off by default, but it shouldn't be completely removed.\n\nNinja edit: Yeah, as @laanwj says, it should definitely be changed across the board, if any change is made at all.

rebroad,2014-02-27T01:19:04Z,"So, shall I change this pull request, and extend it to other areas so that IPs are logged, but only when a command line option is given, which is off by default?
