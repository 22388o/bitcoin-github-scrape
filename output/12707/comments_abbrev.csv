donaloconnor,2018-03-16T18:16:34Z,Similar concerns to @instagibbs . I think I'd prefer the spaces in the log file especially. Also might slightly overlap with work here: #12689 ,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12707#issuecomment-373801110,373801110,

practicalswift,2018-04-26T20:19:56Z,I don't think this change is needed anymore since the newlines are no longer printed to the console. They are now only printed to the log file where they make sense in order to distinguish between two subsequent sessions. So let's keep this one closed! :-),https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12707#issuecomment-384776237,384776237,
