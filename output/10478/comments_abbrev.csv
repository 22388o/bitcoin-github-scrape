laanwj,2017-05-30T16:14:57Z,"> I would maybe consider renaming addrlisten to addrbind and not just restricting it to incoming connections.\n\nGood point. We could also call getsockname for for outgoing connections, though the meaning is somewhat more obscure.\n\nWe use both `bind` and `listen` in command line options so I wasn't sure what to call it, but you're right it correlates more with `bind`'s meaning.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10478#issuecomment-304929832,304929832,
laanwj,2017-05-31T15:07:34Z,"@ryanofsky yes, should have gotten most of them, I still intend to add a python tests. Now that both incoming and outgoing connections have the `addrbind` it's possible to correlate 100% the connection ids between local nodes.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10478#issuecomment-305216706,305216706,

ryanofsky,2017-05-30T15:37:13Z,"I think it would be helpful if you could add comments for `addr` and `addrLocal` above, they contain ""ip address and port of the peer"" and ""local address"" according to RPC documention, and say specifically how `addrListen` is different from `addrLocal`.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10478#discussion_r119135562,119135562,src/net.h
