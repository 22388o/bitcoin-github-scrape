promag,2020-11-25 23:23:03,"Have you considered the ""overload"" approach from https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/variant/visit (looks like it may be included in c++20, https://wg21.link/P0051)?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20480#discussion_r530690708,530690708,src/rpc/util.cpp
MarcoFalke,2020-11-26 08:33:11,That'd be dangerous because it allows for implicit conversions and non-exhaustive visitors. Bugs like #17924 would be harder to find if the overload approach was used.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20480#discussion_r530851957,530851957,src/rpc/util.cpp

MarcoFalke,2021-01-04 11:34:54,No reason. Simplfied diff by using the same approach everywhere.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20480#discussion_r551264828,551264828,src/rpc/util.cpp
