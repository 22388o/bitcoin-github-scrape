This PR clearly doesn't offer those benefits or meet that bar. Much of the feedback in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14837 also applies here.\r\n\r\nConcept NACK",

People can look at this if they are interested, and if they think they think the new code is an improvement over the old code they can say \"hey this new code is really great\" and maybe make an argument for merging it, or have a discussion, or find problems we didn't previously know about.

    "body": "Well, the idea is that I wanted to understand how this part of the code was working and it was needlessly more complicated than it should be.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand it better, I refactored it into something simpler. I opened the PR because if anyone in the future has an interest in looking at this logic, perhaps because they are adding a new script flag, I would point them towards perhaps doing this refactor first if the logic becomes especially complex. \r\n\r\n\r\nHaving a PR open means that if someone touches this function DrahBot will automatically warn the conflict, allowing a reviewer to check it out as well even if they don't search. \r\n\r\nAnother possible outcome from this would be to turn this version of the code into a comment, which details that the semantics of the following code should be equivalent to the comment flow.\r\n\r\nAnother benefit of this, and a reason why you should spend your time to review it, is that it passes the test suite. If you think there is a risk that this code couldn't have identical semantics, you could write a test demonstrating that which would help protect us from errors made down the line when there are changes adding a feature rather than behavior less refactoring.\r\n\r\nThe same is true for benchmarking -- I don't necessarily suspect that the current version is slow, but perhaps now this gives me a reason to write a benchmark which can test master as well (I didn't write this one with performance in mind, just clarity). That benchmark can help prevent regression in the future. ",

    "body": "I suggested a few years ago that we could have two independent script implementations in the codebase (1) a stripped-down version of the current code, only for use in consensus logic, which is rarely touched and (2) a feature-rich one that undergoes refactoring and addition of features as needed for everything else. There would obviously be tests to (aim to) verify correspondence between the two, but from an assurance perspective, we would not know for sure that they exhibit the same behavior in all cases. Bugs in the second would only affect its users, rather than risk forking the network however.\n\nThis is the sort of change that would make perfect second in (2), but not in (1).",

(I reproduced this from scratch, not a branch that existed prior). Each commit *should* be able to run and pass all tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n@sipa I agree that it would be good to produce an untouched version that stays the same for a very long time -- I suppose where we might differ in opinion is that I think that this might be a good candidate for that freeze/reference logic ahead of the fork to a more feature-ful version. I'm not what kind of features you mean though, given that they would probably impact consensus at the end of the day.",

    "body": "We don't disagree that the goal is consistency.\r\n\r\nMy view is that, as noted above, this version is superior in maintaining consistency with future versions/features added.\r\n\r\nI.e., if we add further complexity to this code for handling a new case or flag we will have an increased likelihood of those code paths causing an incompatibility if the flag is added against the old version than against a refactored version. E.g., if the current version is 0.20 and 0.21 makes a change that is incompatible with version 0.20 and earlier that is worse than a change which is compatible with 0.20 and incompatible with 0.19. I doubt that in the event of a catastrophic fork error anyone is going to take \"whatever Bitcoin 0.8 syncs to\" as the ground truth.\r\n\r\nWhat's further nice about this version is that because SegWit is pattern matched, an incompatible future change in script processing (or existing bug) has segwit's behavior isolated, reducing the surface of a change to EvalScript's logic having an impact on SegWit detection, even at the expense of consistency. I'd personally -- and I understand this may not be a consensus view -- rather have old nodes fork off if SegWit had some specification error in it which caused old interpreters to treat SegWit programs as invalid spends. I admit that's a cherry picked example -- it's entirely possible the new code would make something previously spendable unspendable.\r\n\r\nAgain, I'm not strongly advocating that we need to change the code to be this way. But I think it might be worth it to do something like this in advance of further flags or complexities being added which bear an equal if not greater risk of breaking consensus.",
