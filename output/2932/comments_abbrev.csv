laanwj,2013-08-29T11:13:26Z,"Sounds sensible to do all the parsing of parameters in ParseParameters.\nMaybe store the URL as well, and not only signal a boolean? This avoids having to scan the arguments again to find out what exactly the URL was.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2932#issuecomment-23481851,23481851,
Diapolo,2013-08-29T13:45:09Z,"Nice suggestion, but what happens, if the parameters would contain multiple bitcoin: URIs or is that even a possible condition?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2932#issuecomment-23490095,23490095,
laanwj,2013-08-29T15:06:07Z,"Yes, I think that's a possible condition.\nYou could make it store a vector of strings instead of one string. A length of zero would then mean ""no URL"".\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2932#issuecomment-23496403,23496403,
Diapolo,2013-09-20T10:18:14Z,@laanwj Changed to a vector of strings and modified paymentserver to benefit of the changes. Can you take another look?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2932#issuecomment-24801258,24801258,

laanwj,2013-09-29T07:28:48Z,"Yep, haven't tested it though!\n\nIn time it'd be better to split off the RPC client to a seperate executable and remove the hack. Likely we'd need to do this in two steps\n0.9.x) add rpc client executable (I leave it to other people to bikeshed the name), support rpc client in bitcoind for backwards compatibility but deprecate it\n0.10.x) remove backwards compatibility in bitcoind\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2932#issuecomment-25315810,25315810,

Diapolo,2013-10-01T08:40:34Z,Your suggestions are good but far beyond the scope of this pull :). Any final comments/nits/ACKs?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2932#issuecomment-25433542,25433542,
laanwj,2013-10-01T16:41:50Z,"Code changes are ACK, but anything that affects command line parsing needs to be extensively tested. So I'd like to see test reports from a few people (that bitcoin URLs still work, and other options still work, that the rpc client still works, and combinations...) before merging.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2932#issuecomment-25467025,25467025,

gavinandresen,2013-10-04T05:29:01Z,"util.cpp ParseParameters is the wrong place to look for bitcoin: URIs, in my opinion.  It should just return an array of strings that it could not parse.  The payment server code can then look through that array and pull out any bitcoin: URIs.\n\nThe payment server code currently looks for two things:  bitcoin: URIs, but also filenames to files that contain payment requests.
