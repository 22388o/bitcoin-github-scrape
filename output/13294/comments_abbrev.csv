practicalswift,2018-06-07T17:18:36Z,@laanwj Would you be okay with the other non-`#ifdef` change in this file? If so I can split that one out. Getting rid of the OpenBSD warnings would be nice :-),https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13294#issuecomment-395498688,395498688,

fanquake,2018-06-08T01:01:02Z,@practicalswift I don't think there's a need to split anything out of here. Probably easier to just drop the `random.cpp` changes from this PR. They can be revisited later with a different approach.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13294#issuecomment-395612655,395612655,

laanwj,2018-05-29T15:22:15Z,"This is correct but I... think this is somewhat overdoing it, creating an ifdef forest just to avoid a warning.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13294#discussion_r191467493,191467493,src/random.cpp
practicalswift,2018-05-29T21:56:14Z,This code just replicates the already existing `#ifdef` forest (implicit in the code below) but if we can avoid the warning in a smarter way I'm all ears. What method do you suggest using for avoiding the warning? :-),https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13294#discussion_r191586851,191586851,src/random.cpp
Empact,2018-05-29T22:54:10Z,One option would be to forward-declare the method here and define it below based on a define that occurs inside the relevant #ifs.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13294#discussion_r191598862,191598862,src/random.cpp
