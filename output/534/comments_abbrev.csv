gavinandresen,2011-09-27T17:11:15Z,"Testing:  Unless somebody has already written a tool to generate low-difficulty valid-but-orphan blocks, I think we may have to rely on code review and unit tests (unit tests are part of this pull).\n\n(I am working on a tool to generate blocks and transactions for testing, but have more work to do on it)\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/534#issuecomment-2213423,2213423,

gavinandresen,2011-09-27T17:15:11Z,"You can't use testnet to test this, because testnet doesn't have block-chain lock-in points and there's no way to generate orphan blocks on purpose with too-low difficulty.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/534#issuecomment-2213458,2213458,
ByteCoin,2011-10-04T02:20:13Z,What's the justification for having more checkpoints than just the latest?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/534#issuecomment-2281826,2281826,
gavinandresen,2011-10-05T15:47:37Z,Justification for more than the last checkpoint is it makes it harder for an attacker to waste a newbie's time downloading a long-but-invalid chain.\n\nPruning some of the checkpoints in the middle is probably a good idea.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/534#issuecomment-2299475,2299475,

gmaxwell,2013-06-02T04:04:07Z,Why are you replying to two year old pulls?  This doesn't make the node reject any blocks that it wouldn't already (ultimately) reject.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/534#issuecomment-18801677,18801677,
sipa,2013-06-02T09:13:51Z,"Indeed, it's not a rule change. It just detects invalid blocks earlier.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/534#issuecomment-18804374,18804374,
