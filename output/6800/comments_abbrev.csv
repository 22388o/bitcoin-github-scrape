theuni,2015-10-10T17:52:17Z,"I'm unsure if this is a local issue or not. It would be great if someone else on OSX 10.11 could test the rc1 .dmg to see if it also crashes for them: https://bitcoincore.org/cfields/bitcoin-0.11.1rc1/bitcoin-0.11.1-osx-unsigned.dmg\n\nTo reproduce: just double-click the dmg. For me, Finder crashes and I never see the contents of the image.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6800#issuecomment-147112543,147112543,
