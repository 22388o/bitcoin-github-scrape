Is mingwthrd supposed to be a full replacement for mingw32? (I don't think so)\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/946#issuecomment-4626370,4626370,
luke-jr,2012-03-21T20:26:58Z,What if we add -lmingw32 onto the end of LIBS (after -lmingwthrd)?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/946#issuecomment-4626400,4626400,

luke-jr,2012-03-21T21:26:16Z,"Aha, great. Really too bad qmake doesn't have a prefix operator, though.\n\nCan anyone test that this creates a secure build when cross-compiling?
