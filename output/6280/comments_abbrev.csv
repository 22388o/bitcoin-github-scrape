luke-jr,2015-06-15T00:25:45Z,"NACK, we shouldn't be patching dependencies here since we need to support building with system dependencies too. Doesn't gitian already succeed? That's all that should use depends/ ...\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6280#issuecomment-111891555,111891555,
laanwj,2015-06-15T05:57:12Z,At least for 0.12/master I think we should boost the boost version instead of piling up more local patches.\n\nFor backporting this seems fine to me.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6280#issuecomment-111934717,111934717,
laanwj,2015-06-15T10:12:24Z,"@luke-jr the depends system does not only exist for gitian, it's also there for doing cross-compilation, or building when the necessary dependencies don't exist for the distro. Unfortunately it doesn't contain a gcc version, so it has to work with user's gcc which comes from a wider version range than just that used by gitian.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6280#issuecomment-112005034,112005034,
welshjf,2015-06-15T13:16:23Z,"To be clear, this isn't a failure to build Bitcoin with system dependencies, it's a failure to build Boost. My own need was for working on the depends build itself (namely bumping Qt) without going through the whole gitian setup. I didn't see this as the common case which is why I didn't base against 0.11. The gitian environment will be affected too if it's ever updated. Feel free to close if bump",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6280#issuecomment-112065585,112065585,
theuni,2015-06-15T17:54:05Z,"Agreed with bumping boost. There were problems with some versions after 1.55, but iirc 1.58 is relatively solid and a good candidate for us.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6280#issuecomment-112152665,112152665,
