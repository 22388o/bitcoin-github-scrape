ryanofsky,2019-03-27T20:06:33Z,"It seems like this should say || not &&. If either the time is to low or the height is too small, the block is too early?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15670#discussion_r269746878,269746878,src/chain.cpp
ryanofsky,2019-03-27T20:08:08Z,"This decreases test coverage for bisecting based on time.\n\nIt would be better if this PR just added a few new tests for nonzero heights, and left the existing tests alone (by passing 0 minimum heights).",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15670#discussion_r269747486,269747486,src/test/skiplist_tests.cpp
ariard,2019-03-27T21:33:24Z,"Yes, already corrected locally and tests seem ok, wasn't sure of std:lower_bound behavior at first",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15670#discussion_r269779726,269779726,src/chain.cpp
ariard,2019-03-27T22:32:55Z,"Done, also few tests covering both block attributes.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15670#discussion_r269796884,269796884,src/test/skiplist_tests.cpp
