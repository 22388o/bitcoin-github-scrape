gavinandresen,2012-06-21T23:22:19Z,Can you add a doc/CJDNS.txt with the information on how to configure?\n\nI'll let people who know a lot more about networking than me to ACK or NACK.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1498#issuecomment-6497142,6497142,
sipa,2012-06-22T20:51:57Z,"If I understand it correctly, CJDNS uses FC00::/8 as network range, which is half of RFC4193's unique local range?\n\nI'm wonder whether this does risk clashing with anyone who wants to use RFC4193's range for other purposes. Inside the bitcoin P2P protocol this is not necessarily a problem (for now, it doesn't clash with anything, as the onioncat and garlicat ranges are inside the other half of t",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1498#issuecomment-6517992,6517992,

cjdelisle,2013-02-18T06:24:29Z,"There was some renewed discussion of the issue and I wanted to record the current state of the situation.\n1. All networks such as garlicat and onioncat are encoded by using reserved space in ipv6 addresses.\n2. Bitcoin nodes relay addresses to everyone, ipv6 addresses are relayed to ipv4 nodes etc (changing this is non-trivial)\n3. Cjdns uses an enormous amount of ipv6 space.\n\nBitcoin nodes wil",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1498#issuecomment-13708066,13708066,
cjdelisle,2012-06-21T23:26:23Z,It would be cool to see a comment explaining why fc00::/8 means cjdns.\nHere is the documentation on why cjdns will never use any addresses outside of the fc00::/8 range.\nhttps://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns/blob/master/rfcs/Whitepaper.md#pulling-it-all-together\n\nHere is the relevant RFC which explains why it is unlikely to see fc00::/8 addresses routed on the internet.\nhttp://tools.ietf.org/htm,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1498#discussion_r1030367,1030367,src/netbase.cpp
