    "body": "I guess there's two issues: the first being I think when someone starts bitcoin with `-rescan` it _should_ scan every block, as that is the safest behaviour and the one of least surprise. \n\nThe second issue, which I guess is not addressed by this pull request is someone does:\n`bitcoin-cli importprivkey $PRIV_KEY \"\" false`\n\nand then restarts bitcoind (with or without -rescan) it will only start scanning at the earliest key creation time, which may very well be after the key was used. Bitcoin should probably persist something into the wallet letting it know it needs to rescan from block 0, but I'm not familiar enough with the code to do this.\n",

Strange, no?\n- When running `bitcoind -rescan` the logs even say that it's scanning from the genesis block:\n  https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/425473c056424574f73935add3f110fbce770273/src/init.cpp#L1229\n  which to me would indicate, that the intention of rescan is to actually rescan everything.\n- I believe I might have already lost some coins due to bitcoind's behaviour.
