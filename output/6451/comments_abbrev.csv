jtimon,2015-07-17T20:48:43Z,The old and new sizes should also be in Consesnsus::Params. MaxBlockSize should therefore take a height and a const Consesnsus::Params& as parameters. The same goes for MaxBlockSigops().\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6451#discussion_r34929649,34929649,src/consensus/consensus.h

jtimon,2015-12-20T10:19:24Z,"Should also be in Consensus::Params, and the current limit as well. Also why 1000*1000 instead of 1000000 like it was?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6451#discussion_r48101953,48101953,src/consensus/consensus.h

jtimon,2015-12-20T10:34:17Z,If version is lower than 5 it doesn't matter the result of the IsSuperMajority call?\nYou don't need an if and to assign false to the bool: just assign all the conditions to the variable directly . It's simpler and you would have probably not made the mistake you did if it wasn't for the unnecessary if statement.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6451#discussion_r48102095,48102095,src/main.cpp
