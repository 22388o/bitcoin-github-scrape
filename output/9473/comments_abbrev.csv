laanwj,2017-01-05T09:30:28Z,"Yes, splitting makes translation harder. Fragments are harder to translate, and the result may not be sensible especially in right-to-left languages (though that's not as much of a problem when splitting per sentence I guess...).",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9473#issuecomment-270600735,270600735,
MarcoFalke,2017-01-05T12:59:40Z,"The rational was that stuff like `_(""This option can be specified multiple times"")`is used for several options, thus can be split.\n\nBut meh, not worth to bike shed about.
