gavinandresen,2013-01-23T03:37:02Z,"Yes, it is time-consuming to rebuild dependencies for gitian, so when we do, I would rather we upgrade QT and boost and openssl any other dependencies (and maybe the OS we build on and the version of the compiler we use) all at once. The pain of changing dependencies is, I think, the reason we have so few people gitian-building releases, and that's a real problem.\n\nI don't see any ""must have"" fi",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2108#issuecomment-12580134,12580134,
Diapolo,2013-01-23T06:02:43Z,"@gavinandresen If you prefer batch dependency upgrades perhaps I should just include the latest Boost version also. I'm fine with creating that pulls, because at least in the Win-world it is (most of the time) essential to stay up-to-date (security and performance wise).\n\nI took a look at Gitian also, but the howto setup was a real pain for me and I came to the conclusion that I currently don't ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2108#issuecomment-12582845,12582845,
