    "body": "This change is partially, if not totally, flawed. \nThis change gives a tool for an attacker to increase considerably the attack surface!\n\nAny user can send a peer a transaction that returns IsMine() == true or IsFromMe() == true if he knows who the peer is (the peer's public key).\n\nCreating transactions that return IsFromMe()=true the attacker can bypass penny flooding prevention and IsStandard() and go directly to the CPU-expensive ConnectInputs() code.  This creates a perfect DoS attack. He can also skip IsStandard() and put non-standard txs into mapOrphanTransactions. Afterwards he can send a single tx that triggers the verification of thousands non-standard transactions at once, and I'm almost sure this can be used to mount a DoS.\n\nCreating transactions with IsMine() = true is also dangerous. The attacker can create a non-standard tx and send 0.0000001 to the victim's address and bypass penny flooding prevention and isStandard(). The peer would blindly relay that transactions to remaining peers. This could be used (although I didn't explore how to do it) to force the remaining nodes to block the victim's node. \n\nI find this change very disturbing, from the security point of view.\n",

For each group, create a non-standard tx with 1 input an 10000 outputs.

(you can check that using the command \"mempool\"). This is because the victim's node won't check the tx.GetMinFee(1000, true, GMF_RELAY) protection for that tx since IsMine() =true.\n6) Then proceed recursively (binary search)  to discover which of the 10K address is the victim's pubkey.\n\nThis is a classical side-channel attack.\n\nMy opinion: Never branch the code checking IsFromMe() / IsMine() in CTxMemPool::accept()\n\nNote that the use of fFromMe does not posses any risks .\n",

    "body": "\"A\" could be achieved by sending the transaction directly to the miners (I don't know how to achieve that) . Then only the miners will know who send it.\n\nYour idea to hide the transaction is interesting...The node should act exactly as if the transaction had been rejected. Also there should be no timing differences between rejecting and hiding. \n\nThe only problem I see is that if the attacker has two connections to the victim, then he can monitor if the transaction goes out from the other end, so the attack it still possible...\n\nAnyway, why do you want to force to relay transactions that go to you? \n\nYour decision to relay/not-relay as a single node in the network has very little probability to influence the fact that the transaction will or won't be included in a block by a miner. It is only relevant if you own a high percentage of the nodes of the network, so you can chain transmissions until a miners node.\n\nMaybe what you want is to put the transaction into a special pool to monitor for 0-confirmations, but not for re-transmit.\nCould you explain what is the real benefit for you of this change? What's the use case?\n",
