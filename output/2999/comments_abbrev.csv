prusnak,2013-09-15T18:38:35Z,+1. I carry the same desktop file patch for openSUSE packages.\n\nAlso don't use absolute paths in executable/icon file and no file extension for icon. (If these are in standard paths - and they are - the desktop environment will find them).\n\n```\n-Exec=/usr/bin/bitcoin-qt %u\n+Exec=bitcoin-qt %u\n-Icon=/usr/share/pixmaps/bitcoin128.png\n+Icon=bitcoin128\n```\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2999#issuecomment-24477189,24477189,

I prefer red bikesheds over all other colors.\nBecause contrib/debian is always out-of-sync and I usually update it on here after upload when something other than version numbers change.\nThe 0.9 update will probably come after 0.9 releases when i get a chance to code it up.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2999#issuecomment-24637503,24637503,
