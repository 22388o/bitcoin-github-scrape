sipa,2016-08-16T16:34:25Z,"I just realized that this may be intentional, as we perhaps still do accept sub-minrelayfee transactions (""free transactions"") before the mempool fills up?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8527#issuecomment-240159484,240159484,
MarcoFalke,2016-08-16T16:44:41Z,"Correct. If we stopped handling free transactions, quite a lot of code would simplify/can be deleted.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8527#issuecomment-240162393,240162393,
MarcoFalke,2016-08-16T16:48:24Z,I think this patch passes the extended rpc test suite. This reminds me that a small test (maybe for the extended suite) could be helpful to check that priority transactions don't break accidentally.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8527#issuecomment-240163551,240163551,
MarcoFalke,2016-08-23T18:57:38Z,"Closing. Apparently, we need tests for priority or remove it, but this should be done in a separate pull.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8527#issuecomment-241839887,241839887,
