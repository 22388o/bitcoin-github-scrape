jonatack,2019-08-01 18:38:02,"Thanks everyone for reviewing. Agreed, updated, and rebased. Two options for harmonizing the logging seem to be the simplicity of ""Bitcoin Core"", and the more specific but longer ""Bitcoin Core server"". Tentatively proposing the first as it is short and understandable with the bonus of not changing the other messages that output just ""Bitcoin Core"" e.g. `git grep 'probably already running."")'`.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16489#issuecomment-517408355,517408355,
