laanwj,2012-12-03T10:02:17Z,"I wonder why we still have a mysterious boolean parameter for the 'modal' state, even though that's one of the CClientUIInterface flags? :-)\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2045#discussion_r2290644,2290644,src/qt/bitcoingui.cpp
Diapolo,2012-12-03T10:06:09Z,"I think the reason is in bitcoin.cpp ThreadSafeMessageBox(), where we first use the modal flag. I'm sure it could be removed, when I have time I'll take a look. Do you think this should block merging this pull then?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2045#discussion_r2290673,2290673,src/qt/bitcoingui.cpp
laanwj,2012-12-03T10:17:08Z,"Possibly. I think the current semantics is pretty vague. Some of the flags are usable, but not modal, because it's separated out to a different parameter. A pull request to change this would affect exactly the same areas as this one. So let's try to do it right in one go.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2045#discussion_r2290767,2290767,src/qt/bitcoingui.cpp
