MarcoFalke,2019-09-30 18:41:55,"> Add test_fuzzing_harnesses.sh for easy verification that our fuzz harnesses work the way we expect them to. More specifically that we are able to reach different unique code paths when varying input.\n\nHas this ever been an issue? Instead of adding a script that seems to give little reward, I'd prefer a script that exports the coverage to html.\n\nThis can be done with clang out of the box:",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17000#issuecomment-536696194,536696194,
practicalswift,2019-09-30 21:48:50,"@MarcoFalke Oh, I use this script all the time and thought others might find it useful :)  Did you read the output? I find this script gives me much more valuable information than our current fuzz runner, but I could be biased :)\n\nPersonally I prefer getting coverage information in the terminal so I'll let someone else run with the export HTML idea :)",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17000#issuecomment-536767148,536767148,

practicalswift,2019-10-02 07:23:34,@MarcoFalke Have you tried this script? if not I suggest taking it for a spin before dismissing it :) The runtime is really quick compared to `llvm-cov` :),https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17000#issuecomment-537370239,537370239,
