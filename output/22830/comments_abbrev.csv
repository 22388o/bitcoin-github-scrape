Right now, it assumes that port `9050` is used, while it has a connection to the Tor control socket so could directly ask what the SOCKS5 proxy port it is listening on is (`GETINFO net/listeners/socks`, I think, see [control-spec.txt](https://github.com/torproject/torspec/blob/main/control-spec.txt)).
