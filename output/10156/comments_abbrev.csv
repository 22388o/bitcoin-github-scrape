laanwj,2017-04-07T15:30:16Z,"> This is because there is the potential for the size of the application to be larger then the size of the current screen, abs() should handle that corner case.\n\nThinking of it, I don't think abs fixes this problem. \nE.g. say the screen is 10x10, and the window 20x20. With the code without abs, the position of the window will be ((10-20)/2, (10-20)/2) or (-5,-5): screen will be centered in t",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10156#issuecomment-292568994,292568994,

The user cannot cannot easily grab the application and re-size/move it...hence the move and the abs() . \n\nWhile we could also resize the application to fit, I think if you do that th",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10156#issuecomment-292579175,292579175,
