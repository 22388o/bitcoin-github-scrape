tjps,2017-03-22T23:18:29Z,Ack. will remove the trivial marker when I update the PR for the apparently broken test.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10058#issuecomment-288569440,288569440,

jonasschnelli,2017-03-23T07:25:45Z,"~~AFAIK it was slightly wrong to free the ppmutexOpenSSL via `OPENSSL_free`. IMO only objects alloced by `OPENSSL_malloc()` should use `OPENSSL_free()`. This change makes sense.~~\nI was wrong: It is currently (master) alloced with `OPENSSL_malloc`.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10058#discussion_r107601910,107601910,src/util.cpp

JeremyRubin,2017-03-28T22:05:57Z,Probably cleaner to just use a `std::unique_ptr<CCriticalSection[]>`,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10058#discussion_r108549031,108549031,src/util.cpp
JeremyRubin,2017-03-28T22:07:12Z,and then here `ppmutexOpenSSL.reset(new CCriticalSection[CRYPTO_num_locks()]);` I think is correct.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10058#discussion_r108549267,108549267,src/util.cpp
tjps,2017-03-29T00:36:17Z,You are correct.  I always like shaving lines off.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10058#discussion_r108570296,108570296,src/util.cpp
