achow101,2019-07-29 15:50:50,Rebased and added a release note. Also fixed a bug in the test.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16394#issuecomment-516049209,516049209,
jnewbery,2019-07-31 19:47:36,code review ACK c5d37873677551caac34752214dd491f5278c8d5,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16394#issuecomment-516994195,516994195,
luke-jr,2019-08-20 00:11:48,Could have just passed null?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16394#issuecomment-522800968,522800968,
promag,2019-07-16 00:15:19,"Couldn't happen at the moment but in the future this warning could be cleared/overwritten after `CreateWallet(...)`. Maybe the response should have `""warnings"": [...]`.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16394#discussion_r303685707,303685707,src/wallet/rpcwallet.cpp
promag,2019-07-16 00:17:03,Don't use named arguments or also use positional arguments - to cover the fix?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16394#discussion_r303685987,303685987,test/functional/wallet_createwallet.py
achow101,2019-07-17 15:27:44,Added a test for it.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16394#discussion_r304473365,304473365,test/functional/wallet_createwallet.py
achow101,2019-07-17 15:29:22,"The only warnings come from wallets that already exist, so this shouldn't effect `CreateWallet`. I guess if such a warning is added that would be part of `CreateWallet` we could change it them. However it would be a breaking change to the API.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16394#discussion_r304474343,304474343,src/wallet/rpcwallet.cpp
promag,2019-07-17 15:35:29,"Well it's still possible with concurrent `createwallets`. You could have 2 `std::string warn1, warn2;` and at the end join them :hear_no_evil:",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16394#discussion_r304477449,304477449,src/wallet/rpcwallet.cpp
jnewbery,2019-07-26 16:08:18,"I agree with promag that we shouldn't just throw away the first `warning` string. If you're worried about breaking the API, then joining the strings seems like good solution.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16394#discussion_r307811073,307811073,src/wallet/rpcwallet.cpp
achow101,2019-07-29 15:50:31,Joined them,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16394#discussion_r308304374,308304374,src/wallet/rpcwallet.cpp
ryanofsky,2019-07-31 16:48:23,"I think it would probably be better to join with newlines to increase visibility or the create warning and avoid ambiguity in case a current or future warning includes a semicolon. Also I think we join warning and error strings elsewhere with newlines, so newlines here would be more consistent.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16394#discussion_r309324997,309324997,src/wallet/rpcwallet.cpp
achow101,2019-07-31 17:39:58,I don't feel like changing it.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16394#discussion_r309347142,309347142,src/wallet/rpcwallet.cpp
promag,2019-07-31 17:47:50,"When I suggested ""join them"" I also thought of multiple lines.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16394#discussion_r309350543,309350543,src/wallet/rpcwallet.cpp
