jgarzik,2013-03-29T01:25:45Z,"Nice!\n\nFWIW, In my own programs, I usually add a ""--free"" command line option, which optionally cleans up on exit (slowing down exit), rather than the rapid exit(0).  Similarly, since freeing the block index and other numerous structures is a lot of pointless work at shutdown for 99.9% of users, I would suggest something similar for bitcoind.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2420#issuecomment-15624726,15624726,
