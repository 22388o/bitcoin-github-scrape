jmcorgan,2017-02-18T11:58:38Z,"No, the purpose is not to track IP changes during runtime; merely to allow specifying the configuration parameter using hostnames instead of raw IP addresses.  IP address assignments can change in a network and it is typical practice to use hostname/DNS resolution to keep configurations stable and make host->addr mappings in a single place.\n\nThis is already done in bitcoind for the -addnode, -",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9774#issuecomment-280841077,280841077,

laanwj,2017-02-17T08:22:25Z,"Yes, that'd have to use libevent DNS lookups, which are asynchronous by default, thus someone more complicated to handle. There may be a synchronous way of doing lookups as well, I don't remember if that's exposed outside the http sublibrary.\n\nI'm not sure how important it is in practice, as running torcontrol over a network is extremely discouraged by the Tor developers [not even getting star",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9774#discussion_r101706374,101706374,src/init.cpp
