laanwj,2014-09-17T11:12:47Z,Verified that the same command with my version of clang (built from git) give exactly the same output.

laanwj,2014-09-17T11:22:36Z,"When we merge this we should probably send out a notification on the mailing list etc, to tell people what to do if they have current patches against these files - ie, to run clang-format on the patched version as well as the original and then do a diff to create a new patch.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4933#issuecomment-55880214,55880214,

laanwj,2014-09-20T09:43:39Z,@sipa I don't think so either. However people may have private patch sets. So it needs to be documented how to get past this in any case.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4933#issuecomment-56262972,56262972,
