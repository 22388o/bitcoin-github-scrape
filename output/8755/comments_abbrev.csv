TheBlueMatt,2017-09-29T18:19:05Z,"Strong Concept ACK on at least making CODESEPARATOR and FindAndDelete non-standard. Can we push forward on that independantly to get it done sooner rather than later, then at least the sighash limits can be reviewed separately and are more straight-forward? Any plans to rebase this @jl2012?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8755#issuecomment-333200668,333200668,

jl2012,2018-03-06T18:56:55Z,"@sipa: this requires #8654 and #11423. But #8654 needs to maintain a cache of 256 32-bytes hashes per input which might impact validation. It could be reduced to 6 hashes/input if we softfork away those 250 non-std nHashType.\n\nThe alternative is #8756, which does not require #8654 and #11423.

MarcoFalke,2018-06-05T19:37:29Z,Does adding a new constant require the tests to be updated as well? See `ValidateCheckInputsForAllFlags`,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8755#discussion_r193195627,193195627,src/script/interpreter.h
