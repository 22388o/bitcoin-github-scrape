    "body": "@practicalswift I did in fact check. The issue came up while I was testing #17292, I accidentally put in randrange(vec.size()) somewhere, and it had the nice effect of crashing my computer :)\r\n\r\nThis lead me to check the rest of the codebase, including that example in net_processing. I did think it was a bug at first, but I think the loops pre-conditions (mapOrphanTransactions.size() > 0 && for every element in mapOrphans there is one in g_orphan_list) imply g_orphan_list.size() != 0.\r\n\r\nI checked the others and they also have pre-conditions that make 0 impossible. edit: I didn't check the tests, just the program code.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI think you are incorrect that assert in randrange is dangerous. It's the other way around: returning a too-big number is dangerous, as it can lead to entire system crashes (as in on my system) as opposed to graceful panics or it can lead to random memory probing and leaking secrets. We should improve all the call sites and maybe do the range projection as sipa notes, but we should not ever return something outside the specified output, even if that means crashing. ",
