TheBlueMatt,2017-04-26T00:41:33Z,"Hmm, it would be nice to get some more thorough testing of this in. Useful to have tests that ""just call it"", but to really qualify it as ""tests listaddressgroupings"" you might want to also create a few test addresses, create some raw transactions to them, test that addresses shared in the input are grouped which weren't previously, and then test that the groupings are transitive (ie if you have a",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10255#issuecomment-297205115,297205115,
jimmysong,2017-04-26T01:30:35Z,@TheBlueMatt Thanks for the suggestion. I'm going to have to study a bit more on exactly how addresses group together in the `wallet-accounts.py` test to get a handle on what the groups should be and shouldn't be. I'm fine with removing that this RPC is tested for now or making this task a bigger one with a more thorough test of listaddressgroupings.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10255#issuecomment-297211793,297211793,
jnewbery,2017-04-28T21:51:41Z,"@jimmysong - I haven't looked at the complete test, so I don't know if this breaks things further down, but I imagine you can do this by:\n\n- generate 102 blocks instead of 101. That means the node has 2 coinbase rewards of 50BTC, which are unlinkable and so should be in different groupings.\n- construct a single transaction which sends 25 BTC from each address to an external address.

jnewbery,2017-05-01T17:42:21Z,"Looks good @jimmysong . Thanks for persisting with this.\n\nI would personally prefer to do the second `listaddressgroupings` before you generate a new block, so the only differences between the first and second calls are:\n- in the first call, the addresses are in two separate groupings and in the second call they're in the same grouping\n- in the first call, both addresses have balance 50 an",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10255#issuecomment-298383986,298383986,
