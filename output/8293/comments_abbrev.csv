theuni,2016-06-30T07:45:01Z,"Concept ACK. A few nits:\n- Please store the test as build_no_programs or build_libs_only or so, so that we only need the ugly xnononono stuff in one place.\n- I'd rather not abuse system_univalue that way, as it's not obvious what it's doing. Please change that to configure_embedded_univalue or so, and rework the test as necessary.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8293#issuecomment-229584962,229584962,
