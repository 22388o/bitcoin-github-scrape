sipa,2018-03-16T00:52:22Z,Can we suggest people use `importmulti` instead?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12701#issuecomment-373568924,373568924,
kallewoof,2018-03-16T00:53:10Z,"@sipa Yes, sure, but the same situation applies to one key if the user passes `rescan=false` and then later changes their mind. (And I didn't realize `importmulti` existed until after I screwed up.)\n\nI guess the alternative is to add a `rescan` RPC command. Felt overkill though, but maybe better?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12701#issuecomment-373569034,373569034,
sipa,2018-03-16T00:54:28Z,"@kallewoof Yes, but for `importmulti` you never need to set `rescan=false`. It's both smarter and more selective, and will always rescan the relevant part of the chain only once.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12701#issuecomment-373569245,373569245,
kallewoof,2018-03-16T00:56:40Z,"@sipa That's cool, I didn't realize it was that sophisticated. (And I didn't realize it existed until I started digging into the code.)\n\nSo... we should probably add a note to `importprivkey` to use `importmulti` for more than one key. I'll make a separate PR for that now...",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12701#issuecomment-373569575,373569575,
promag,2018-03-16T00:58:27Z,"NACK.\n\n> I guess the alternative is to add a rescan RPC command. Felt overkill though, but maybe better?\n\nThere is already `rescanblockchain`.\n\n> If you are importing several private keys into a wallet, you don't want the rescan to trigger every time, so you might pass rescan=false to importprivkey\n\nThat was the motivation behind `importmulti` IIRC.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12701#issuecomment-373569834,373569834,
sipa,2018-03-16T01:00:28Z,"Also, if really necessary, you can already explicitly trigger a rescan using the `rescanblockchain` RPC. But in general I think we should encourage `importmulti` over manually letting users control rescanning - they shouldn't need to care or know about it in an ideal world.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12701#issuecomment-373570165,373570165,
kallewoof,2018-03-16T01:01:31Z,I searched the code for `RescanFromTime` and couldn't find anything. Didn't realize we had `rescanblockchain` already. Closing.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12701#issuecomment-373570327,373570327,
