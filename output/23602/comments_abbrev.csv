I don't understand how it can be unrelated to wallet encryption. It uses a private key to sign, right?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23602#issuecomment-980050892,980050892,

Though, I am happy to put all `HELP_REQUIRING_PASSPHRASE` RPCs into one file, as long as the file is split up in *some* way.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23602#issuecomment-980058093,980058093,
laanwj,2021-11-26 15:30:40,"No, I'm fine with this (though I'm not sure it goes far enough, if you want to split up `rpcwallet.cpp` it might make sense to make a bigger plan), it was just a surprise, I see the `EnsureWalletIsUnlocked(*pwallet);` now.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23602#issuecomment-980060026,980060026,

meshcollider,2021-11-29 00:58:56,"Concept ACK, but I too think we could definitely go even further than this. Things like\n- move `wallet/rpcdump.cpp => wallet/rpc/backup.cpp` and combine with `backupwallet` and `restorewallet` RPCs.\n- introduce `wallet/rpc/util.cpp` and move the helper functions there, like `GetWalletForJSONRPCRequest` and `EnsureWalletIsUnlocked`, etc.\n- introduce `wallet/rpc/addresses.cpp` and move `getnew",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23602#issuecomment-981202156,981202156,
MarcoFalke,2021-11-29 16:46:30,I've removed fa24419d22 again to avoid the conflicts. This can be done as a second step later. I think it is pretty clear that this will be done in smaller steps according to the plan above by @meshcollider ,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23602#issuecomment-981815489,981815489,
