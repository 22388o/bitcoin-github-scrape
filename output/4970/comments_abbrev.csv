laanwj,2014-09-25T14:02:18Z,"BTW speaking of this, it would also be useful to be able to more easily build bitcoin + deps as ""release with debug symbols"", using the same CFLAGS and defines as the normal build but with debug symbols enabled. This allows addr2line for tracebacks on the gitian executables. This is currently possible but requires hacking in descriptors.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4970#issuecomment-56822658,56822658,

Ideally I'd like a -g argument on gitian, which would build everything w/ debug infos.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4970#issuecomment-56926673,56926673,
