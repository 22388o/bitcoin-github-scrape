richardkiss,2016-12-13T22:09:45Z,I can submit a patch that goes the other way (NULLFAIL => SIG_NULLFAIL) if the consensus is that way is preferable. I'm agnostic.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9342#issuecomment-266877871,266877871,
richardkiss,2016-12-13T22:58:12Z,See https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/compare/master...richardkiss:feature/unify_sig_nullfail?expand=1 for a look at the other direction. This requires quite a few more changes.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9342#issuecomment-266889154,266889154,
kallewoof,2017-02-09T04:53:34Z,"`SIG_NULLFAIL` refers to the signature (not) being null, so shortening to `NULLFAIL` is NACK from me. Concept ACK on `NULLFAIL` -> `SIG_NULLFAIL`. There's also `SCRIPT_VERIFY_NULLFAIL` which I think should probably ideally be `SCRIPT_VERIFY_SIG_NULLFAIL`.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9342#issuecomment-278547052,278547052,
