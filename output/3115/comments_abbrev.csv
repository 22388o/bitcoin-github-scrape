sipa,2013-10-20T11:35:53Z,"@laanwj The reasoning is that there are callbacks from the node/validation to the wallet; they're really just notifications in general, as the node code shouldn't care about what the wallet does with it (in fact, the signal names shouldn't contain ""wallet"" even, though I chose not to change them here). As EraseFromWallet was _only_ called as a callback, I just simplified the method here. In the ca",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3115#issuecomment-26671293,26671293,
