SCDeveloper,2016-09-12T00:18:41Z,Why is this not added here? Yet ImmatureWatchCreditCached is? Mistake or is there a reason for it not being here?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8703#issuecomment-246214626,246214626,
jonasschnelli,2016-09-12T09:34:08Z,@SCDeveloper: can you elaborate what this change is trying to fix?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8703#issuecomment-246296436,246296436,
SCDeveloper,2016-09-12T12:54:33Z,I am asking if it is missing in the first place.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8703#issuecomment-246337964,246337964,
SCDeveloper,2016-09-13T14:37:23Z,Can anyone elaborate why it isn't in MarkDirty()????\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8703#issuecomment-246702548,246702548,
laanwj,2016-09-13T15:40:48Z,"Looks like fImmatureCreditCached is never cleared except when the transaction is initialized. I don't think that is correct, unless it can never change.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8703#issuecomment-246724567,246724567,
SCDeveloper,2016-09-13T16:57:03Z,"I would of thought it would be best to have it in MarkDirty(), I have it currently within my code I am due to release shortly (Silk(SLK) & DarkSilk(DSLK)) and have no issues. I just don't understand why Bitcoin doesn't have it there?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8703#issuecomment-246749218,246749218,
morcos,2016-09-13T18:29:28Z,utACK.\n\nI certainly don't think it hurts to put it in MarkDirty and it makes more logical sense.\nI don't think it'll actually change behavior though since GetImmatureCredit returns 0 instead of accessing the cache if this test fails:\n`if (IsCoinBase() && GetBlocksToMaturity() > 0 && IsInMainChain())` \nand I can't see as how the amount of the immature credit could change otherwise. \n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8703#issuecomment-246777321,246777321,
SCDeveloper,2016-09-13T19:27:26Z,I think it is just safer and more logical to have it covered than to not.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8703#issuecomment-246795700,246795700,
sipa,2016-09-13T21:24:06Z,"The only reason why an immature balance cached value can get invalidated is when the longest chain length decreases, which is an exceedingly rare and hard thing in Bitcoin mainnet (it requires a massive reorg crossing a retarget, with large time difference).\n\nHowever, agree, for consistency and obviousness of correctness, utACK.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8703#issuecomment-246829417,246829417,
