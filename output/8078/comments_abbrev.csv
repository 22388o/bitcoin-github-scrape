petertodd,2016-05-20T15:21:35Z,"@luke-jr That's why it's still allowed for whitelisted nodes; in general it's a DoS attack and we need a better system. Also we discussed the bootstrap case and think getting all the mempool isn't actually all that useful, for things we expect to need it like block relaying optimizations - need a subset.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8078#issuecomment-220635760,220635760,
