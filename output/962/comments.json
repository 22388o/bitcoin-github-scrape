The first thing the loop does is count the number of outbound connections, and if the maximum has been reached (8 or -maxconnections), then it goes into a 2 second delay loop until the count is below the max.\"\n\nThat code is in ThreadOpenConnections2 and I'm asking, if the wiki is obsolete or the code has a bug, because -maxconnections will never be > 8, because of \"min(8, (int)GetArg(\"-maxconnections\", 125)\" and will allow to disable outbound connections completely if you set -maxconnections=0 or < 0.\n\nInbound connections are handled via ThreadSocketHandler2 and I should simply remove that change and we can safely ignore that in the discussion from now on :).\n",
