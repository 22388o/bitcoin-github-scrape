ian-kelling,2017-03-02T12:55:55Z,"How I I verified the 0 value disables timeout: Bitcoin passes the value directly to libevent, reading libevent source code shows that 0 disables it. I did a manual test to verify that it would at least go longer than the 900 default. My test command completed in about 1600 seconds with no timeout.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9903#issuecomment-283646269,283646269,
