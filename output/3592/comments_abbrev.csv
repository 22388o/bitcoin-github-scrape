laanwj,2014-01-28T09:58:25Z,"This looks like a kind of chimera of the old string and the ""standard rejection reason"" from BIP22. How does this work in practice, is only the initial part matched to the 'Reason' table in https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0022.mediawiki?\nShould we be consistent and use either the minus-delimited-style or the space delimited style of message?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3592#discussion_r9221977,9221977,src/main.cpp
luke-jr,2014-01-28T16:00:15Z,"In practice, it's really only seen/used by humans right now. I figured this was a good compromise of consistency between different software, without sacrificing the level of detail bitcoind is able to provide. Replacing the space with a dash/minus sounds like a good improvement to me.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3592#discussion_r9231774,9231774,src/main.cpp
