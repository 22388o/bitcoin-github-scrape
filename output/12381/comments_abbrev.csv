laanwj,2018-02-08T14:08:27Z,"Probably call InterruptMapPort here too, before Stop, for consistency.\n\nEdit: Oh, you have Stop call Interrupt? That's different from other [Start|Stop|Interrupt] constructions. As you probably know, the idea behind having a seperate interrupt is to have a two-stage (parallel) shutdown process, in which the interrupt can ask the subsystem to shut down, then Stop waits for it to really have sto",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12381#discussion_r166943113,166943113,src/qt/optionsmodel.cpp

laanwj,2018-02-08T19:34:00Z,Sure - though if interrupt is idempotent there's no problem in calling it in Stop too.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12381#discussion_r167044221,167044221,src/qt/optionsmodel.cpp
