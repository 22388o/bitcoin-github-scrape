For example most math functions in C have arguments as double while in C++ the arguments are both floats and double and long double.\n\nI actually ended up doing this while I've seen a warning in some log10 usage saying that float was used and extended to double or something along the lines. Not a big deal though.\n\nAnother benefit of usi",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12184#issuecomment-357546379,357546379,
