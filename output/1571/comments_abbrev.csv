Diapolo,2012-07-17T09:05:48Z,The last commits ensures we can easily handle an extended networking page (with additional QValidatedLineEdit fields) in `eventFilter()` without duplicating much UI element code.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1571#issuecomment-7030145,7030145,
Diapolo,2012-07-21T14:00:50Z,@laanwj I would like to merge that last commit after you took a look.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1571#issuecomment-7153130,7153130,
laanwj,2012-07-10T10:34:01Z,What did you change here?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1571#discussion_r1129954,1129954,src/qt/optionsdialog.cpp
laanwj,2012-07-10T10:34:31Z,`emit proxyIpValid(fProxyIpValid)`?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1571#discussion_r1129958,1129958,src/qt/optionsdialog.cpp
Diapolo,2012-07-10T11:06:25Z,"Yeah, that's good.\n\nEdit: Updated with the last rebase!\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1571#discussion_r1130198,1130198,src/qt/optionsdialog.cpp
Diapolo,2012-07-10T11:08:01Z,"I simply split the if(case 1 && case 2) into 2 if(case 1) { if(case 2) } as this is likely needed, when adding more proxy options. I remember you learned me to split a pull like this off from a new feature pull :).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1571#discussion_r1130208,1130208,src/qt/optionsdialog.cpp
laanwj,2012-07-10T11:37:56Z,You can factor it out of the IF/ELSE statement too :)\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1571#discussion_r1130395,1130395,src/qt/optionsdialog.cpp
laanwj,2012-07-10T11:38:33Z,"Ok, yes, that makes sense.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1571#discussion_r1130399,1130399,src/qt/optionsdialog.cpp
Diapolo,2012-07-10T11:50:43Z,"I had that in mind too, don't ask me why I didn't do it. Perhaps I like rebasing so much :D.\n\nEdit: Take a look at the code, I guess this is now even better!\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1571#discussion_r1130450,1130450,src/qt/optionsdialog.cpp
laanwj,2012-07-17T06:30:25Z,"Lol I guess you could move this to a signal handler for proxyIpValid now, instead of here (though I think this is fine, it's your choice).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1571#discussion_r1176028,1176028,src/qt/optionsdialog.cpp
Diapolo,2012-07-17T08:22:48Z,"I will create an additional commit for this, take a look and then we decide if we leave this as is or use the version after the commit.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1571#discussion_r1176472,1176472,src/qt/optionsdialog.cpp
laanwj,2012-07-21T15:22:26Z,"Customizing this message causes extra work for the translators. I think it's better to keep this message generic, so that we can re-use it for all settings that need restarting. \n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1571#discussion_r1210872,1210872,src/qt/optionsdialog.cpp
