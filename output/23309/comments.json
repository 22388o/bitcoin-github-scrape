    "body": "Strong concept ACK on providing a REST API which is built with the intention to be secure.\r\n\r\nThe current situation where we don't want to vouch for the security of our REST API and instead suggest that our users should roll their own sanitisation via an `nginx` proxy if they want to use it in settings where security might be needed feels really weird for a security critical project. We can do better! :)",

    "body": "@practicalswift That seems entirely orthogonal here. The concern with REST (and also RPC, though RPC has additional exposure) is that it isn't designed to be DoS resistant, so it's assumed to only be exposed to clients that are trusted to not DoS attack the node. Putting in a Python wrapper that translates REST to RPC seems like that would only worsen this.",
