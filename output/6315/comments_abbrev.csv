Diapolo,2015-06-21T11:00:25Z,"Not sure if you're right here, when the if clause isn't true we always run into the else (as we have a return in the if we won't reach the return 0, if the clause is false). I'd rather remove it...\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6315#discussion_r32892539,32892539,src/qt/bantablemodel.cpp
Diapolo,2015-06-21T11:02:01Z,Still the question: Is `int` the right type here? I tried `(QVariant)` which also works and is more the Qt style?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6315#discussion_r32892552,32892552,src/qt/bantablemodel.cpp
jonasschnelli,2015-06-21T11:03:35Z,"Right. This is also the same as we have it in PeersTableModel, it works, but i agree that it should be QVariant (as the method definition says).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6315#discussion_r32892566,32892566,src/qt/bantablemodel.cpp

Diapolo,2015-06-21T11:21:59Z,"You could also use something like:\n`qDebug() << QString(""%1: Requesting update for peer banlist"").arg(__func__);` I intend to creat a pull to make use of that format so we have the debug logging include always the correct function name :).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6315#discussion_r32892700,32892700,src/qt/clientmodel.cpp

Diapolo,2015-06-26T15:25:24Z,"I rechecked the code and during a translation for my build I came to this.\nThe `&` is used as a shortcut when pressing ALT IMHO, so this will produce 2 shortcuts for every single menu entry. I'd suggest just removing them, because it will be hard to make them unique and still usable.\n\nEdit: I can't even access them on Windows... perhaps they are not wanted in context menus?
