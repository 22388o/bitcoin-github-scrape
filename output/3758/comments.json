    "body": "those build instructions are not very good. in my experience ubuntu 13 and ubuntu 12 behave differently due to the BDB dependency. it took me a couple of days to get the dependencies right.\n\nit would be better to support build scripts from clean OS'es via jenkins, i.e. support a complete script as is typical now in web development, due to complex stacks. its cool that bluematt set up jenkins.he also maintains the PPA's: https://launchpad.net/~bitcoin/+archive/bitcoin . as bitcoin integrates more with other infrastructure management will become more difficult.\n",
