    "body": "I'm not convinced on enabling logging of thread names by default, though more convenient during development, I think it increases the size of the log entries and files for something not useful for most users. But for the tests it makes a lot of sense.\r\nAlso the unifying of how to create the scheduler thread makes sense. Though we need to move away from the boost thread group at some point.\r\nACK 99993489da9bc003b823bcab10e5f5297b369431",
