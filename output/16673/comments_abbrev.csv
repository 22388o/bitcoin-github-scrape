LarryRuane,2021-04-24 03:48:04,"Force-pushed required rebase. I should have mentioned earlier that you can test this manually by starting `bitcoind`, waiting for it to start up and sync, and then running:\n```\nkill -SIGHUP `pgrep bitcoind`\n```\nThen check `debug.log`; the version information and configuration settings should appear at the end.

LarryRuane,2019-08-29 20:27:43,"@practicalswift, I don't think this was an actual problem. I added a debug print and `unexpected_msgs` didn't include previous values. I think it's not broken because this function, `assert_debug_log()`, doesn't modify the variable (it's not mutable).
