gmaxwell,2015-01-27T17:00:39Z,"@Diapolo amusingly, I fixed that in secp256k1 git master about a day ago.  Can you try compiling that standalone to confirm?

laanwj,2015-01-06T07:34:36Z,I wonder if we could somehow move this testcase-only code to src/tests instead of here.\nNah OTOH it's just a few lines. Any approach I can think of would either leak secp256k1 specifics on the interface or involve creating a larger wrapper.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5506#discussion_r22511587,22511587,src/key.cpp

sipa,2015-01-06T14:57:41Z,"@gmaxwell just suggested adding functionality in libsecp256k1 for its rfc5979 implementation to accept extra entropy, which could be used for the 'test_case' function too, in a much cleaner way.\n\nThe change here is 100% compatible with the existing code though, so unit tests relying on it don't break.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5506#discussion_r22526207,22526207,src/key.cpp
