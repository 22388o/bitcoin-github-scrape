      "message": "tests: Add std::locale::global to list of locale dependent functions in lint-locale-dependence.sh\n\nWe currently flag `setlocale(...)` as locale dependent, but prior to this commit we didn't flag\n`std::locale::global(...)` as such.\n\nIn addition to setting the global C++ locale `std::locale::global(...)` also does the equivalent\nof `std::setlocale(LC_ALL, ...);`.\n\nThus the functionality of `std::locale::global(...)` is a superset of `setlocale(...)` :)",
