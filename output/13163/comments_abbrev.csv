laanwj,2018-05-04T07:01:56Z,"Concept ACK - indeed, not exposing unnecessary symbols is good, it can speed up linking, and also allows the compiler to be smarter with inlining.\n\nCan we somehow verify that you got them all? In C, we'd use `-Wmissing-prototypes` but compilers don't tend to support that for C++.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13163#issuecomment-386520072,386520072,
