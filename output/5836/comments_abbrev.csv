laanwj,2015-03-09T11:16:22Z,"I'll leave this up to @theuni.\n\nI wonder if there is something akin to clang-format for these files. I'm not against increasing readability, but it is very subjective if it is not possible to automate a certain set of rules. At least try to do this all at once, so that we don't break current pulls affecting `configure.ac` multiple times.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5836#issuecomment-77835998,77835998,

theuni,2015-03-12T03:49:43Z,"@laanwj My thoughts exactly. These are all good cleanups, but without any real formatting rules this is basically a never-ending syntax ping-pong.\n\n@randy-waterhouse I'm not thrilled about all the whitespace/formatting changes because as I see it one of two things will happen:\n1. These will go in, but the next set of changes won't necessarily match.\n2. These go in, then we start policing nits ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5836#issuecomment-78419429,78419429,
randy-waterhouse,2015-03-13T07:43:38Z,"I agree, it is too trivial to waste our time on a back and forward about formatting style preferences.\nYou seem to know what you want and you can take from my mods whatever you like. \n\nThe file does need cleaning up though it is in a bit of a state.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5836#issuecomment-78851856,78851856,
laanwj,2015-03-09T11:10:27Z,"Although it adds a bit of readability, 'pad with spaces' alignment has the disadvantage that a change on one line makes it necessary to change every line in the table, which makes reviewing changes harder, and can introduce merge conflicts. So I'm generally not in favor of it.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5836#discussion_r26027461,26027461,configure.ac
