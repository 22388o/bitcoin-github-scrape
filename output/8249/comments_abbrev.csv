It's just the security check that fails after the build. If you don't run that, this pull works fine w/ older gccs.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8249#issuecomment-246956990,246956990,

theuni,2016-09-22T06:30:52Z,"@laanwj ACK on making it non-fatal for now. Optimally with some kind of switch to elevate warnings to errors like -Werror. That way we could set it as a real error in gitian when it should be supported, even though we allow older toolchains to configure with warnings.\n\nI'm still head-down in toolchain stuff, maybe we can have this turned on for 0.14.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8249#issuecomment-248823276,248823276,
