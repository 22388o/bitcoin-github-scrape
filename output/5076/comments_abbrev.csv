Diapolo,2014-10-11T17:40:28Z,"That is better, but I'm missing constants to replace those default values in the code!\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5076#issuecomment-58757813,58757813,
luke-jr,2014-10-14T21:28:00Z,Making constants makes more discussion. Let's do that in a follow-up PR after this is merged.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5076#issuecomment-59119628,59119628,
Diapolo,2014-10-15T06:22:47Z,Why? Just because you want to hurry ;).\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5076#issuecomment-59162771,59162771,
luke-jr,2014-10-15T06:27:27Z,Because it's better to do things in small steps so there's less to rebase when one part of it prompts months of discussions. And this gets one improvement out there sooner if the other one pushes past a release. There's nothing inherently related about variablising stuff here.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5076#issuecomment-59163095,59163095,
laanwj,2014-10-15T07:11:31Z,"Agree with @luke-jr here. Right now this is an extremely low-impact change, and reviewing is limited to the documentation only. If you were to make constants and use those it is more work to verify that everything is unchanged.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5076#issuecomment-59166316,59166316,

laanwj,2014-10-11T08:03:43Z,"Please parametrize only the '1' here, that makes for an easier translation message\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5076#discussion_r18740091,18740091,src/init.cpp
laanwj,2014-10-11T08:05:12Z,"Same here. Just parametrize the number, not part of the message\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5076#discussion_r18740097,18740097,src/init.cpp
luke-jr,2014-10-11T08:05:17Z,"Does it? ""0 if no -proxy or -connect"" doesn't really make sense :/\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5076#discussion_r18740098,18740098,src/init.cpp
luke-jr,2014-10-11T08:05:55Z,It makes even less sense here to just parameterise the number...\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5076#discussion_r18740101,18740101,src/init.cpp
laanwj,2014-10-11T08:06:32Z,See it from this angle: making people translate a message as a fragment that will be inserted as-is into another message is just pointless.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5076#discussion_r18740102,18740102,src/init.cpp
luke-jr,2014-10-11T08:08:06Z,"If the default changes, only that part will be invalidated in the translations, not the entire description?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5076#discussion_r18740107,18740107,src/init.cpp
laanwj,2014-10-11T08:09:22Z,Why would that be better? In both cases you have to re-translate one message. But in the case of the fragment it makes much less sense to the translator.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5076#discussion_r18740111,18740111,src/init.cpp
laanwj,2014-10-11T08:10:16Z,Fine with me - then don't parametrize anything at all here...\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5076#discussion_r18740116,18740116,src/init.cpp
laanwj,2014-10-14T09:40:21Z,"Not your mistake, but I only notice this now: this should be '1 if no &lt;mode> specified'. Let's leave default out of this. If 1 would really be the default, it would always do a zapwallettxes operation!\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5076#discussion_r18817679,18817679,src/init.cpp
luke-jr,2014-10-14T20:13:58Z,Removed\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5076#discussion_r18855039,18855039,src/init.cpp
