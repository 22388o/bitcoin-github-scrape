icota,2020-04-12 19:46:15,"Agreed that it shouldn't be ""mobile"". But ""touch"" implies touchscreens when it's perfectly usable with a mouse & keyboard combo. perhaps ""qml""? ""modern""?

promag,2020-08-31 13:07:33,I think this is in the wrong place. This is similar to use global variables and IMO it's fragile (but convenient). I'd suggest to add a property `required Action aboutAction` to this component and set it in main.qml. ,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16883#discussion_r480117277,480117277,src/qt/res/qml/WalletPane.qml
