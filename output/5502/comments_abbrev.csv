fanquake,2014-12-19T09:54:49Z,"The reason I'd left that undoxified was because the big comment seems to make more sense just in the file. This is how it appears in the doxygen output.\n![screen shot 1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/863730/5502612/b23012f0-87a7-11e4-87cf-a6e6a5cf4926.png)\n\nACK changing the other lines, but I think 16 - 48 should be left as is.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5502#issuecomment-67618494,67618494,

jonasschnelli,2014-12-29T10:23:12Z,@Diapolo i agree with @fanquake \nThe big ASCII-Visual-//// blocks should be not within a doxygen block.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5502#issuecomment-68246215,68246215,
laanwj,2014-12-29T12:57:01Z,_if_ you want to include it in the doxygen documentation then it needs serious reformatting to make it readable. Otherwise I'd indeed suggest leaving it as-is.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5502#issuecomment-68255171,68255171,
jgarzik,2014-12-31T12:53:30Z,NAK for reasons @laanwj indicated\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5502#issuecomment-68440174,68440174,
