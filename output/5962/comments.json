    "body": "I appreciate the idea here, but this doesn't go far enough to do what it looks like it's doing.\n- Only the sources in src/ are checked, which may or may not be checked in.\n- Includes, defines, and un-defines aren't added, so it's not actually testing real build configs.\n- Maintaining a list of suppressions is not realistic, since things move around all the time.\n\nInstead, it'd need to look more like:\n\n```\ncppcheck:\n        cppcheck $(SOURCES) $(BITCOIN_INCLUDES) $(CPPFLAGS)\n```\n\nBut that would get unwieldy, because there are lots of gotchas wrt flags and includes. So in reality, we'd have to deal with each set of sources (internal convenience libs) separately.\n\nInstead, something like clang-check that's able to cope with the entire build-system is a much better solution here imo.\n\nAlso, the resource leak pointed out above looks a real leak.\n",

But configure then complained that the compiler is unable to create executables, so I actually had to comment out parts of `configure.ac`. Is there a standard way of doing this?\n",
