    "body": "utACK\r\n\r\n@gmaxwell I'm pretty sure the generated code is identical or of similar performance with this change. Perhaps someone needs to look at the generated code, but the very similar constructions on https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v0.17.0/src/crypto/common.h#L17L54 compile to essentially no-ops.  \r\n\r\nAs far as UB goes, https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/union claims \"The details of that allocation are implementation-defined, and it's undefined behavior to read from the member of the union that wasn't most recently written. Many compilers implement, as a non-standard language extension, the ability to read inactive members of a union.\", which I believe to be true for gcc and clang. \r\n\r\nFinally, indeed it's weird that we rely on the exact memory representation of floating point numbers for serialization. However, it seems that the only place it's used (outside of tests) is for the `TxConfirmStats::decay` field, when saving/loading fee estimates to/from disk. That doesn't seem too hard to first convert to an integer or so as an independent change.",

    "body": "No, you'd need to add a ser_writedata_float and ser_writedata_double, mimicking the existing integer write functions, which write the data directly.\n\nThat shouldn't break anything, as right now that is essentially what is happening already, except the data is first being reinterpreted as an integer, and then written as an integer.\n\nThe issue is that on big-endian systems, the float data is reinterpreted as native (big endian) integers, which are then serialized as little endian. The overall effect of that is that on BE systems, floats and doubles are byteswapped when reading/writing, which makes it incompatible across systems.\n\nThe code you suggest would not work, as it'd cast the floating point numbers semantically to integers (rounding them) rather than reinterpreting.",

This is probably not an issue in practice as BE archs are pretty rare now. My point was that the byte ordering might be switched when loading the file on a BE float arch. I've read that even some systems have half endianess where integer are LE while 754 are BE. Anyway that is a rabbit hole and maybe out of scope here. Thanks for the response.",
