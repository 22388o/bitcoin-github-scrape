jonasschnelli,2016-07-14T11:50:42Z,This PR contains identical commits then #8328 and #8329.\nCan you explain why there are multiple PRs?\nIMO opening a single small PR and trying to get this merge would be more efficient (and only open/PR further work when the first part has been merged).\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8337#issuecomment-232643633,232643633,

jtimon,2017-05-20T09:32:44Z,"The goal is more to take it out of chain.h than to put it in consensus/consensus.h. consensus/header_verify would be fine as well. As an example, #8493 puts the check in libconsensus without putting chain.o in libconsensus too. Whether blocks eventually become valid when violating this rule or not, I think the question that should be asked is ""in a hypothetical finished libconsensus, is this check",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8337#discussion_r117606092,117606092,src/consensus/consensus.h
