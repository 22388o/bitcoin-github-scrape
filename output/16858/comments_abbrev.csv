jameshilliard,2019-09-14 11:17:15,@TheBlueMatt I think it's important to have an explicit recommendation on what's needed to fix the error. The instructions for users to contact merchants to provide a BIP21 compatible URI should help discourage merchants from forcing BIP70 by increasing support requests if they refuse to provide BIP21 compatible URI's(reduced support costs are the main reason BIP70 is still being forced by process,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16858#issuecomment-531471517,531471517,

jameshilliard,2019-09-14 12:03:57,"Well it's up to the merchant ultimately to support it, but if a bunch of users submit support requests to the merchant asking for BIP21 compatible URI's then it's much more likely the merchant will add support for BIP21 due to customer demand as opposed to potentially some other protocol.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16858#issuecomment-531474269,531474269,

jameshilliard,2019-09-14 13:06:34,Well you would want to specify BIP21 so that the merchant doesn't just suggest a [different incompatible BIP70-like payment method](https://github.com/bitpay/jsonPaymentProtocol).,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16858#issuecomment-531478400,531478400,

jameshilliard,2019-09-14 18:41:08,Well I think the point is to ensure that customers are not just requesting a BIP70 alternative but BIP21 specifically as Bitpay is likely to suggest using jsonPaymentProtocol if the request is not explicitly for BIP21 support. I wonder if it would make sense to link to a tool like https://github.com/achow101/payment-proto-interface in the error message for decoding bitpay requests.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16858#issuecomment-531503874,531503874,
