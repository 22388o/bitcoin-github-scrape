laanwj,2015-09-29T09:29:50Z,"Somehow I cannot get travis to pass here. Even though ""travis: for travis generating an extra build"" is on the 0.10 branch, it still creates an extra empty test target.\n@theuni any idea?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6706#issuecomment-144005364,144005364,
btcdrak,2015-09-29T17:36:57Z,@laanwj Travis has been doing this in a lot of places randomly. That extra target is bogus and can be ignored.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6706#issuecomment-144130906,144130906,
laanwj,2015-09-29T19:42:05Z,"@btcdrak Sure, but we managed to correct that on the branch by twiddling with the `.travis.yml` file (which is why it doesn't appear in master pullreqs or the 0.11 one). But somehow it does here. And it's not random, I re-triggered it three times.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6706#issuecomment-144167268,144167268,
