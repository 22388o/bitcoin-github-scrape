laanwj,2021-05-18 06:53:18,"> Rationale for this PR is to make it a bit easier to switch between tooling, e.g. to ""upgrade"" a regular watch-only wallet created by Specter to work with Core hardware wallet support directly.\n\nI guess it should only be possible to do so for watch-only wallets, not for wallets that already have their own private keys?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21928#issuecomment-842902019,842902019,

luke-jr,2021-09-01 02:08:54,Not sure about having this as a compile-time conditional. Maybe document it and mention that omission means the build doesn't support it?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21928#discussion_r699790985,699790985,src/wallet/rpcwallet.cpp
