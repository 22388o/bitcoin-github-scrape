laanwj,2017-01-19T06:09:29Z,"This clearly seems a bug. There's two options here: \n- repair the PostCommand functionality so that the PostCommand handler actually runs (by having a RAII cleanup that triggers it)\n- remove the PostCommand functionality\n\nIt looks like this currently influences nothing as no PostCommand handlers are being registered.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9575#issuecomment-273690439,273690439,
