fjahr,2021-08-01 16:57:16,"Thanks for addressing my comments @ryanofsky . I thought I might be missing something so thanks for confirming that current `FoundBlock` objects aren't reused, I kind of interpreted that into the description of the PR. I would probably have explored adding a `found()` method to `FoundBlock` that checks for values being set but I agree with your comments on the assumptions that would be making.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22215#issuecomment-890553541,890553541,

I think setting it other places would just add complexity and possible confusion (and I guess be less efficient, not that efficiency matters).\n\nImplementation here is also consistent with the current `FoundBlock` desig",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22215#discussion_r678499361,678499361,src/node/interfaces.cpp
