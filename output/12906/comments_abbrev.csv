ryanofsky,2018-04-07T09:02:25Z,"> Anyone have an idea why this didn't cause a problem in the Travis win build?\n\nI don't know the specific answer, but I guess there are just different headers or versions of headers used in the two builds. There is some information about the headers that `#define interface struct` at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25234203/what-is-the-interface-keyword-in-msvc and\nhttps://social.msdn.mi",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12906#issuecomment-379454058,379454058,

Mind removing the git from the first command?\n\nCurrently, if you rename files in a scripted diff or add new files, you are required to update the git index, otherwise the `git diff` command which verifies the script will fail because it doesn't see the new paths.
