If you append `CC_FOR_BUILD=cc` to your `./configure` command, everything should work ok. Note that if you're building master, we also just merged a update to the libsecp256k1 subtree, which contains a fix for this issue. So if you `git pull` and rebuild (after cleaning) it may also disappear. Or, as mentioned above, you can checkout and build a specific tag.",
