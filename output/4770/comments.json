    "body": "Jeff, once again you are asking questions that were already answered _in the description of the original patch_. Please do read that document, but I'll repeat the relevant section here:\n\n_Testing_\n\nI attempted to write unit tests for this, but Core has no infrastructure for building test chains .... the miner_tests.cpp code does it but at the cost of not allowing any other unit test to do so, as it doesn't reset or clean up the global state afterwards! I tried to fix this and ended up down a giant rabbit hole.\n\nSo instead I've tested it with a local test app I wrote, which also exercises the client side part in bitcoinj.\n\nThe good news is, Sergio is making a start on fixing this, so in future we'll be able to write unit tests that build test chains. The bad news is we still lack test infrastructure for testing the network stack - there are zero tests that cover ProcessMessages and as a result it's difficult to write them. If you'd like to help fill that need that'd be fantastic.\n\nAdditionally, what dhill reported does not trigger a crash or any other kind of bug that could be easily found using unit testing. It doesn't even seem to trigger a lot of network usage, I guess the data does get truncated somewhere inside the network stack. I repeated his test against my own bitcoind and it survived just fine. What it does is cause a spike in memory usage, so dhill ran such queries many times in parallel until his host ran out of memory. \n\nBut Bitcoin Core does not have a fixed memory budget or any kind of limit - it's just \"whatever the host happens to have at the time\". I'm not even sure if there's any way to write a unit test that checks memory usage. If there was one, it'd lead to the question of what kind of memory usage limit would we select?\n\nSo testing this is not as trivial as it looks. It comes back to the entire anti-DoS question we've been debating for years. A full resource management infrastructure and ability to set resource budgets would be great, and it'd allow us to define this as a bug and test for it.\n",
