It provides a way to be reasonably sure that the\n+executables are really built from source on github. It also makes sure that\n+the same, tested dependencies are used and statically built into the executable.\n+\n+Multiple developers build the source code by following a specific descriptor\n+(\"recipe\"), cryptographically sign the result, and upload the resulting signature.\n+These results are compared and only if they match, the build is accepted and uploaded\n+to bitcoin.org.\n+\n+More independent gitian builders are needed, which is why I wrote this\n+guide. It is preferred to follow these steps yourself instead of using someone else's\n+VM image to avoid 'contaminating' the build.\n+\n+[1] For all platforms except for MacOSX, at this point. Work for deterministic\n+builds for Mac is under way here: https://github.com/theuni/osx-cross-depends .\n+\n+Table of Contents\n+------------------\n+\n+- [Create a new VirtualBox VM](#create-a-new-virtualbox-vm)\n+- [Connecting to the VM](#connecting-to-the-vm)\n+- [Setting up Debian for gitian building](#setting-up-debian-for-gitian-building)\n+- [Installing gitian](#installing-gitian)\n+- [Setting up gitian images](#setting-up-gitian-images)\n+- [Getting and building the inputs](#getting-and-building-the-inputs)\n+- [Building Bitcoin](#building-bitcoin)\n+- [Building an alternative repository](#building-an-alternative-repository)\n+- [Signing externally](#signing-externally)\n+- [Uploading signatures](#uploading-signatures)\n+\n+Create a new VirtualBox VM\n+---------------------------\n+\n+The first step is to create a new Virtual Machine, which will be explained in\n+this section.  This VM will be used to do the Gitian builds. In this guide it\n+will be explained how to set up the environment, and how to get the builds\n+started.\n+\n+Debian Linux was chosen as the host distribution because it has a lightweight install (in\n+contrast to Ubuntu) and is readily available. We here show the steps for\n+VirtualBox [1], but any kind of virtualization can be used. You can also install\n+on actual hardware instead of using a VM, in this case you can skip this section.\n+\n+In the VirtualBox GUI click \"Create\" and choose the following parameters in the wizard:\n+\n+![](gitian-building/create_vm_page1.png =100x20)\n+\n+- Type: Linux, Debian (64 bit)\n+\n+![](gitian-building/create_vm_memsize.png)\n+\n+- Memory Size: at least 1024MB, anything lower will really slow the build down\n+\n+![](gitian-building/create_vm_hard_drive.png)\n+\n+- Hard Drive: Create a virtual hard drive now\n+    \n+![](gitian-building/create_vm_hard_drive_file_type.png)\n+\n+- Hard Drive file type: Use the default, VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image) \n+\n+![](gitian-building/create_vm_storage_physical_hard_drive.png)\n+    \n+- Storage on Physical hard drive: Dynamically Allocated \n+    \n+![](gitian-building/create_vm_file_location_size.png)\n+\n+- Disk size: at least 40GB; as low as 20GB *may* be possible, but better to err on the safe side \n+- Push the `Create` button\n+\n+Get the [Debian 7.4 net installer](http://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/7.4.0/amd64/iso-cd/debian-7.4.0-amd64-netinst.iso).\n+This DVD image can be validated using a SHA256 hashing tool, for example on\n+Unixy OSes by entering the following in a terminal:\n+\n+    echo \"b712a141bc60269db217d3b3e456179bd6b181645f90e4aac9c42ed63de492e9  /home/orion/Downloads/debian-7.4.0-amd64-netinst.iso\" | sha256sum -c\n+    # (must return OK)\n+\n+After creating the VM, we need to configure it. \n+\n+- Click the `Settings` button, then go to the `Network` tab. Adapter 1 should be attacked to `NAT`.\n+\n+![](gitian-building/network_settings.png)\n+\n+- Click `Advanced`, then `Port Forwarding`. We want to set up a port through where we can reach the VM to get files in and out.\n+- Create a new rule by clicking the plus icon.\n+\n+![](gitian-building/port_forwarding_rules.png)\n+\n+- Set up the new rule the following way:\n+  - Name: `SSH`\n+  - Protocol: `TCP`\n+  - Leave Host IP empty\n+  - Host Port: `22222`\n+  - Leave Guest IP empty\n+  - Guest Port: `22`\n+\n+- Click `Ok` twice to save.\n+\n+Then start the VM. On the first launch you will be asked for a CD or DVD image. Choose the downloaded iso.\n+\n+![](gitian-building/select_startup_disk.png)\n+\n+[1] https://www.virtualbox.org/\n+\n+Installing Debian\n+------------------\n+\n+In this section it will be explained how to install Debian on the newly created VM.\n+\n+- Choose the non-graphical installer.  We do not need the graphical environment, it will only increase installation time and disk usage.\n+\n+![](gitian-building/debian_install_1_boot_menu.png)\n+\n+**Note**: Navigation in the Debian installer: To keep a setting at the default\n+and proceed, just press `Enter`. To select a different button, press `Tab`.\n+\n+- Choose locale and keyboard settings (doesn't matter, you can just go with the defaults or select your own information)\n+\n+![](gitian-building/debian_install_2_select_a_language.png)\n+![](gitian-building/debian_install_3_select_location.png)\n+![](gitian-building/debian_install_4_configure_keyboard.png)\n+\n+- The VM will detect network settings using DHCP, this should all proceed automatically\n+- Configure the network: \n+  - System name `debian`.\n+  - Leave domain name empty.\n+\n+![](gitian-building/debian_install_5_configure_the_network.png)\n+\n+- Choose a root password and enter it twice (and remember it for later) \n+\n+![](gitian-building/debian_install_6a_set_up_root_password.png)\n+\n+- Name the new user `debian` (the full name doesn't matter, you can leave it empty) \n+\n+![](gitian-building/debian_install_7_set_up_user_fullname.png)\n+![](gitian-building/debian_install_8_set_up_username.png)\n+\n+- Choose a user password and enter it twice (and remember it for later) \n+\n+![](gitian-building/debian_install_9_user_password.png)\n+\n+- The installer will set up the clock using a time server, this process should be automatic\n+- Set up the clock: choose a time zone (depends on the locale settings that you picked earlier; specifics don't matter)  \n+\n+![](gitian-building/debian_install_10_configure_clock.png)\n+\n+- Disk setup\n+  - Partitioning method: Guided - Use the entire disk \n+  \n+![](gitian-building/debian_install_11_partition_disks.png)\n+\n+  - Select disk to partition: SCSI1 (0,0,0) \n+\n+![](gitian-building/debian_install_12_choose_disk.png)\n+\n+  - Partitioning scheme: All files in one partition \n+  \n+![](gitian-building/debian_install_13_partition_scheme.png)\n+\n+  - Finish partitioning and write changes to disk -> *Yes* (`Tab`, `Enter` to select the `Yes` button)\n+\n+![](gitian-building/debian_install_14_finish.png) \n+![](gitian-building/debian_install_15_write_changes.png)\n+\n+- The base system will be installed, this will take a minute or so\n+- Choose a mirror (any will do) \n+\n+![](gitian-building/debian_install_16_choose_a_mirror.png)\n+\n+- Enter proxy information (unless you are on an intranet, you can leave this empty)\n+\n+![](gitian-building/debian_install_18_proxy_settings.png)\n+\n+- Wait a bit while 'Select and install software' runs\n+- Participate in popularity contest -> *No*\n+- Choose software to install.

Congratulations!\n+\n+Connecting to the VM\n+----------------------\n+\n+After the VM has booted you can connect to it using SSH, and files can be copied from and to the VM using a SFTP utility.\n+Connect to `localhost`, port `22222` (or the port configured when installing the VM).\n+On Windows you can use putty[1] and WinSCP[2].\n+\n+For example to connect as `root` from a Linux command prompt use\n+\n+    $ ssh root@localhost -p 22222\n+    The authenticity of host '[localhost]:22222 ([127.0.0.1]:22222)' can't be established.\n+    ECDSA key fingerprint is 8e:71:f9:5b:62:46:de:44:01:da:fb:5f:34:b5:f2:18.\n+    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes\n+    Warning: Permanently added '[localhost]:22222' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.\n+    root@localhost's password: (enter root password configured during install)\n+    Linux debian 3.2.0-4-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 3.2.54-2 x86_64\n+    root@debian:~#\n+\n+Replace `root` with `debian` to log in as user.\n+\n+[1] http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html\n+[2] http://winscp.net/eng/index.php\n+\n+Setting up Debian for gitian building\n+--------------------------------------\n+\n+In this section we will be setting up the Debian installation for Gitian building.\n+\n+First we need to log in as `root` to set up dependencies and make sure that our\n+user can use the sudo command. Type/paste the following in the terminal:\n+\n+\n+```bash\n+apt-get install git ruby sudo apt-cacher-ng qemu-utils debootstrap lxc python-cheetah parted kpartx bridge-utils\n+adduser debian sudo\n+```\n+\n+When you get a colorful screen with a question about the 'LXC directory', just\n+go with the default (`/var/lib/lxc`).\n+\n+Then set up LXC and the rest with the following is a complex jumble of settings and workarounds:\n+\n+```bash\n+# the version of lxc-start in Debian 7.4 needs to run as root, so make sure\n+# that the build script can exectute it without providing a password\n+echo \"%sudo ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/lxc-start\" > /etc/sudoers.d/gitian-lxc\n+# add cgroup for LXC\n+echo \"cgroup  /sys/fs/cgroup  cgroup  defaults  0   0\" >> /etc/fstab\n+# make /etc/rc.local script that sets up bridge between guest and host\n+echo '#!/bin/sh -e' > /etc/rc.local\n+echo 'brctl addbr br0' >> /etc/rc.local\n+echo 'ifconfig br0 10.0.3.2/24 up' >> /etc/rc.local\n+echo 'exit 0' >> /etc/rc.local\n+# make sure that USE_LXC is always set when logging in as debian\n+echo 'export USE_LXC=1' >> /home/debian/.profile\n+reboot\n+```\n+\n+At the end the VM is rebooted to make sure that the changes take effect.\n+\n+**Note**: If you're following this guide on a physical system instead of a VirtualBox VM you could use `10.0.2.2` instead\n+of `10.0.3.2` in the above `ifconfig` line. This avoids having to patch gitian-builder in next section.\n+\n+Installing gitian\n+------------------\n+\n+Re-login as the user `debian` that was created during installation.\n+The rest of the steps in this guide will be performed as that user.\n+\n+There is no `python-vm-builder` package in Debian, so we need to install it from source ourselves,\n+\n+```bash\n+wget http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/v/vm-builder/vm-builder_0.12.4+bzr489.orig.tar.gz\n+echo \"ec12e0070a007989561bfee5862c89a32c301992dd2771c4d5078ef1b3014f03  vm-builder_0.12.4+bzr489.orig.tar.gz\" | sha256sum -c\n+# (verification -- must return OK)\n+tar -zxvf vm-builder_0.12.4+bzr489.orig.tar.gz\n+cd vm-builder-0.12.4+bzr489\n+sudo python setup.py install\n+cd ..\n+```\n+\n+**Note**: When sudo asks for a password, enter the password for the user *debian* not for *root*.\n+\n+Clone the git repositories for bitcoin and gitian,\n+\n+```bash\n+git clone https://github.com/devrandom/gitian-builder.git\n+git clone https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin\n+```\n+\n+We need to change the guest IP range for the gitian builder because otherwise it will\n+collide with VirtualBox its NAT IP range. Gitian does not have a way yet to configure\n+this, so we need to patch the IPs using `sed`. This is not nice but it will\n+have to do for now... (a [pull request\n+(#52)](https://github.com/devrandom/gitian-builder/pull/52) to make this\n+configurable without patching has been submitted):\n+\n+```bash\n+sed -i 's/10.0.2.2/10.0.3.2/g' gitian-builder/target-bin/bootstrap-fixup\n+sed -i 's/10.0.2.5/10.0.3.5/g' gitian-builder/etc/lxc.config.in\n+```\n+\n+*note* After you update the gitian-builder repository, you may need to repeat these manual changes.\n+\n+Setting up gitian images\n+-------------------------\n+\n+Gitian needs virtual images of the operating system to build in.\n+Currently this is Ubuntu Precise for both x86 architectures.\n+These images will be copied and used every time that a build is started to\n+make sure that the build is deterministic.\n+Creating the images will take a while, but only has to be done once.\n+\n+Execute the following as user `debian`:\n+\n+```bash\n+cd gitian-builder\n+bin/make-base-vm --lxc --arch i386 --suite precise\n+bin/make-base-vm --lxc --arch amd64 --suite precise\n+```\n+\n+There will be a lot of warnings printed during build of the images. These can be ignored.\n+\n+**Note**: When sudo asks for a password, enter the password for the user *debian* not for *root*.\n+\n+Getting and building the inputs\n+--------------------------------\n+\n+In [doc/release-process.md](release-process.md) in the bitcoin repository under 'Fetch and build inputs'.\n+you will find a list of `wget` commands that can be executed to get the dependencies.\n+\n+I needed to add `--no-check-certificate` to the OpenSSL wget line to make it work.\n+Likely this is because the ca-certificates in Debian 7.4 is fairly old. This does not create a \n+security issue as the gitian descriptors check integrity of the input archives and refuse to work\n+if any one is corrupted.\n+\n+After downloading the archives, execute the `gbuild` commends to build the dependencies.\n+This can take a long time, but only has to be done when the dependencies change, for example\n+to upgrade the used version.\n+\n+**Note**: Do not forget to copy the result from `build/out` to `inputs` after every gbuild command!

Copy the resulting `.assert` files\n+in `gitian.sigs` to your signing machine and do\n+\n+```bash\n+    gpg --detach-sign ${VERSION}/${SIGNER}/bitcoin-build.assert\n+    gpg --detach-sign ${VERSION}-win/${SIGNER}/bitcoin-build.assert\n+```\n+\n+This will create the `.sig` files that can be committed together with the `.assert` files to assert your\n+gitian build.\n+\n+Uploading signatures\n+---------------------\n+\n+After building and signing you can push your signatures (both the `.assert` and\n+`.assert.sig` files) to the\n+[bitcoin/gitian.sigs](https://github.com/bitcoin/gitian.sigs/) repository, or\n+if not possible create a pull request. You can also mail the files to me\n+(laanwj@gmail.com) and I'll commit them.\n+"
