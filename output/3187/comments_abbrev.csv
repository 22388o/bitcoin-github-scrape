Diapolo,2013-10-31T16:45:52Z,"AFAIK, I think you are wrong here. URIs are pre-processed and stored in `savedPaymentRequests` via `ipcSendCommandLine()`. Which is done early in init. `initNetManager()` on the other hand isn't even used for sending saved requests to a local TCP server (nor is a proxy used for this), but for fetching payment requests from remote servers.
