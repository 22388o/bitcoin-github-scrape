I.e. where we are not relying on `QLocale` for the locale dependence we want.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is thus that:\r\n* we should continue to remove calls to locale dependent functions (the whack-a-mole game), and\r\n* we should not opt-in to locale dependence we don't want (such as `setlocale(LC_NUMERIC, \"\")`).\r\n\r\nI think we should do *both* - not either-or :)\r\n\r\nWhat would the downsides be from such an approach? :)",

This can cause a conflict when using POSIX functions, for instance, when converting between data types such as floats and strings, since the notation may differ between locales.
