TripleSpeeder,2013-12-09T08:37:00Z,"In one project that is working both with unconfirmed and raw transactions I need to monitor the unconfirmed funds in the hot wallet. First I tried approaches like\n\n```\nconfirmed = bitcoind_api.getbalance('*', 1)\ninc_unconfirmed = bitcoind_api.getbalance('*', 0)\nunconfirmed = inc_unconfirmed - confirmed\n```\n\nand several variations. But this was not working like intended. If I remember corre",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3369#issuecomment-30112690,30112690,

laanwj,2013-12-10T08:08:16Z,"The unconfirmed balance is shown in the GUI, so in a way it makes sense to expose it on the RPC as well.\n\nAnd this looks like a pretty sane and minimal code addition as these things go.\n\nBut indeed, relying on it to see if funds have arrived is dangerous.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3369#issuecomment-30206315,30206315,
TripleSpeeder,2013-12-10T16:39:51Z,"Thanks for your comments. I am running a site that works a lot with unconfirmed transactions, raw transactions and a very custom coin control implementation, so I am aware of the risks involved. \nThe highlevel usecase i need this for is very simple. I have a job running every few minutes that collects from bitcoind both confirmed and unconfirmed balance.
