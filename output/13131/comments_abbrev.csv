laanwj,2018-05-07T12:35:40Z,"> This works generally but CTRL_CLOSE_EVENT times out after 5 seconds on my OS (Win10) if the main thread hasn't ended gracefully. At that point all threads are terminated.\n\nI guess there's nothing to be done against that, and it's the same as on UNIX. Every OS has a timeout after which it loses patience and really terminates a process during shutdown.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13131#issuecomment-387050765,387050765,
