jnewbery,2017-08-25T18:36:31Z,ACK - seems like a reasonable suggestion. Agree that this should be a SHOULD rather than a MUST.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11135#issuecomment-325004134,325004134,
mess110,2017-08-26T23:33:38Z,"The main reason I can think of not to return a JSON object is if it returns something raw like a key or a number. Maybe there are also backward compatibility reasons why non JSON output is returned. Are there any other reasons?\n\nWouldn't it make it easier for clients to always expect a JSON object in the response? It would be future proof as well.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11135#issuecomment-325167723,325167723,
laanwj,2017-08-28T08:35:23Z,"Backward compatibility is a strong reason. We don't change existing interfaces unless there is a a good reason, and just conforming to a developer-notes item is not one.\n\nAlso, it's slightly easier to use from the command-line (especially scripts) with `bitcoin-cli` if something returns a bare value.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11135#issuecomment-325294579,325294579,
promag,2017-08-28T10:48:09Z,"@laanwj the guideline is `Try to make the RPC response a JSON object`, it's not agains bare values.

promag,2017-08-28T13:45:18Z,"No it isn't for sure, but I think we shouldn't have `bitcoin-cli` in mind when deciding API interface.\n\nAs for `bitcoin-cli`, I've previously suggested to have something like `-rpcoutput=...` to ease in those cases, but that's another topic.\n\nDo you think I should improve the guideline?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11135#issuecomment-325357398,325357398,
