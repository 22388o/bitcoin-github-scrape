    "body": "My idea was that we'd get rid of priority, and replace it with a small adjustment to the fee or size of a transaction.\n\nOne idea is to treat the total bitcoindays of the UTXO set as limited resource and treat it as currency, and that burning it should be treated like extra fee, with a small factor. Specifically:\n- for each transaction you compute the bitcoin-days-destroyed\n- divide it by the average UTXO entry age weighed by amount (around 800 days currently)\n- the result is a value in BTC; take some configurable fraction of it (0.5% for example)\n- treat the result as extra fee (which gets divided by the tx size to obtain the feerate).\n\nThis is simple (don't bother recalculating this equivalent fee on every mempool change; just infrequently in the background or even not at all and keep using the value from entry time), and using 0.5% as factor would give a 250-byte 1 BTC-day-destroyed transaction (the limit for high priority earlier) the equivalent of 2500 satoshi/kB feerate boost.\n\nThe downside is that it has no guarantees on how much a miner could lose by using this approach. For example, 100 BTC of 1 year old coins would be treated equal to a 1 BTC fee. We can cap the maximum amount of feerate replaced, but that may make the scheme pretty useless if the cap is easy to hit.\n",

    "body": "To me the most important question is, is priority something that miners want to use?\n\nIf a non-negligible amount of hashpower intends to use it in their transaction selection, then I think it makes sense for nodes to use it too, because it's generally helpful to have your mempool predict the UTXO as much as possible, and for nodes to be able to have reasonable fee and priority estimates (which won't happen unless they track the priority transactions somehow -- I'm presuming that miners run with much bigger mempools than regular nodes).\n\nIf the answer is no, then that's fine and I don't see a reason to push in this direction.  I sort of assumed there was enough hashpower mining with priority, since last time I checked estimatepriority was still giving meaningful results for low-ish blockheights, but I haven't done any kind of real analysis.\n",

However I think we backed ourselves into a bit of a corner by not more clearly communicating and building consensus that priority based transactions were going away before now.   \n\nWe can of course still do that, but I don't like releasing a 0.12 which breaks priority before that has happened.  If we had no choice, then thats one thing, but if a few peoples time to review this code is all it takes to avoid that scenario, we should avoid it.   \n\nWe need to make an analogous decision with respect to #6357.  If we're ok making miners who are using priority space only care about the starting priority of the tx for filling that space (the same way this pull uses that for eviction), then we can skip #6357, but otherwise we have to have it in order to speed up CreateNewBlock.\n",

    "body": "I have been running this since yesterday evening, and made a few free transactions with varying priority to test.  This morning I checked if my transactions were still in my mempool.  They were not.  Even the lowest priority transactions I made were mined, not evicted.  From this I can conclude:\n1. The patch has worked so far, but the transactions were probably mined before my mempool was full.\n2. Free transactions certainly still get mined, disproving @pstratem and others who got think otherwise.\n\nAfter sending the transactions, I made this change to wallet/wallet.cpp to avoid making free transactions with too low priority when priorityestimate returns -1.  If people have the impression that free transactions aren't getting mined, the reason is probably because Bitcoin Core use this too low default priority when it lacks a useful estimate.

Most miners will absolutely mine free transactions since that is still the default policy in released versions of Bitcoin Core. The point was that a few miners have already turned this off, and more will in the future (it is the only incentive-compatible outcome...if they arent receiving enough in fees for them to strongly want to do this, Bitcoin has failed). Setting expectations that these will be mined in the medium term is crazy.\n",

I have not been able to reproduce #6972 or #6959 using this patch. \n\nWhen comparing periodic output from getmempoolinfo on the node running this patch since yesterday, and a different node which run current git version as of two days ago, more transactions are removed from the mempool for each new block on the node running this patch.  Mempool size is the same.  The difference is usually between 50 and 200 transactions, but hardware differences may be a factor here as well.  Nevertheless it is an indication that this version keep more of the transactions most likely to be mined in mempool.  I will try this patch with a smaller mempool on the weaker hardware, and see if it still performs better.\n",

One is against removing priority (Luke-Jr).\n\nAs long as priority is supported, this patch is wanted by at least me, as it fixes two bugs and works very well in my testing.  It is much better than the current mempool limiting code at keeping transactions which will go into the next block.\n",
