In the end it does not change anything in bitcoin (height above 16 is serialized the same way), but it adheres to the specification in BIP34 which explicitly states:\r\n\r\n> The format of the height is \"serialized CScript\" -- first byte is number of bytes in the number (will be 0x03 on main net for the next 150 or so years with 223-1 blocks), following bytes are little-endian representation of the number (including a sign bit).\r\n\r\nThat clearly says the serialization is: `first byte is the number of bytes in the number`.\r\n\r\nIf I, say, wanted to start a testnet and start from scratch, and have a blockchain explorer for this which parses the height form the coinbase, then this would be one strange issue less I'd have to combat.",

    "body": "It doesn't change the behavior of the bitcoin as existing implementation also invokes `CScriptNum::serialize` for numbers larger than 16, I don't see how it can affect the network.\r\n\r\nThe good thing is that it allows testing BIP34 starting from the first block after the genesis. This can be convenient once it's decided to enable BIP34 from the height=1 in regtest. And it seems there is an intention of doing this as `create_coinbase(height, pubkey=None)` accepts the height and its value is correctly incremented in tests. Otherwise, we would need to pre-mine 16 blocks with BIP34 off in all functional tests. It looks like a weird workaround that can be avoided.\r\n\r\nHowever, I see it's a minor change, and there are ways to work around it if needed. Let me know if there is anything I can help here.",
