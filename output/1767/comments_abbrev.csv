When clearing screen in a terminal (ctrl-L), the history is not cleared.\n\nThen again I suppose clearing history in this case can help a bit with privacy, so it may be wise to do so.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1767#issuecomment-8210941,8210941,
laanwj,2012-09-01T09:12:10Z,"BTW the CONSOLE_SCROLLBACK is there to remind that there is currently no scrollback limit. If you use the console very long without clearing, you can theoretically exhaust resources. Maybe this can be solved using `QTextDocument::setMaximumBlockCount` (but I somehow remember there was a counter-intuitive relation between the number of text document blocks and messages).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1767#issuecomment-8211336,8211336,

gmaxwell,2012-09-05T17:19:27Z,A little bit of a layering violation; but one possibility here would be to replace private keys and passphrases in the history with /_SECRET OMITTED_/ or hashmarks or whatever.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1767#issuecomment-8306493,8306493,
