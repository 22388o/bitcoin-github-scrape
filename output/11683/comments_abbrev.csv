jnewbery,2017-11-14T18:27:52Z,Thanks @practicalswift . Looks good but conflicts with #11648. Do you mind reviewing that first to avoid a rebase?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11683#issuecomment-344352243,344352243,
practicalswift,2017-11-14T21:27:28Z,"@jnewbery Sure!\n\nShould I cherry-pick f9cd9b1bfaf65b4e24c1eb9ca8268513e78cc458 into this PR, or should I await merge of #11648?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11683#issuecomment-344404397,344404397,
jnewbery,2017-11-14T21:31:14Z,"Thanks! I don't think you need to do anything for now. If #11648 can get merged soon, then I'd just wait for that and rebase this on top. If #11648 takes a while, then it's fine for this to be merged and I'll rebase #11648 on top of this.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11683#issuecomment-344405416,344405416,
