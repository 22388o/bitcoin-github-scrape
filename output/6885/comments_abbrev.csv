DomT4,2015-10-24T16:34:41Z,It's probably worth using `$(brew --prefix openssl)` instead of a hardcoded `/usr/local/opt/openssl`. People can (and do) stick Homebrew almost anywhere.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6885#issuecomment-150831833,150831833,

rromanchuk,2015-10-29T17:29:27Z,"Sure, but I just followed directions. Are you sure the current formula for `brew install openssl` does what you are saying it does?  I mean no biggie, not hard to fix, but might be worth mentioning. My guess is that you have two reports in five days using a modern OS and the general velocity of new users building for mac os is right on target for this not being user error \n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6885#issuecomment-152257746,152257746,

nkavian,2018-01-26T17:00:06Z,I'm seeing this same problem. What is the solution to get configure to work correctly without exporting the two variables?  `brew --prefix openssl` does work correctly on the command line and I'm boggled why `configure` doesn't work.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6885#issuecomment-360842272,360842272,
