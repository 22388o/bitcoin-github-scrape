super3,2015-05-18T20:34:07Z,About 600+ PEP8 style violations in /contrib alone. Just fixed the comma spacing errors first. \n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6156#issuecomment-103201423,103201423,
laanwj,2015-05-19T09:24:50Z,NACK. Don't do this - these kinds of floods of minor whitespace changes break other pulls for no good reason.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6156#issuecomment-103414143,103414143,
super3,2015-05-19T12:46:33Z,"@laanwj All of PEP8 violations I'm covering are in `/contrib`. With the exception of `/contrib/debian` these directories have not been touched for 4+ months. I agree that minor floods of whitespace on active code would cause problems, but that directory is far from active. \n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6156#issuecomment-103472990,103472990,

jonasschnelli,2015-05-19T13:01:46Z,"I also tend to NACK this.\nGenerally IMO clean code makes sense. But, at the moment there are many pull requests and it's hard to keep focus on what is going on.\nIMO your PR does not produce a benefit for this project at first place.\nSomebody needs to review this. This requires time which is probably better spent at some other PRs.\n\nI think this PR could be something for the trivial branch htt",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6156#issuecomment-103476985,103476985,

E.g. using the wrong kind of indentation would be awful.\n\nBut adding spaces to almost every line so that ',' is lined up. No, that's not important.\nPlease don't waste your time on this.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6156#issuecomment-103526611,103526611,
