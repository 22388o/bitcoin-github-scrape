jgarzik,2015-06-10T18:50:59Z,Concept ACK - IMO this needs a really close review to ensure you don't overflow e.g. the buf that shrank from 4 to 3\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6266#issuecomment-110875735,110875735,
domob1812,2015-06-11T10:10:51Z,I've changed the patch to directly push the characters onto the result instead of using the temporary buffer.  This should be cleaner and less prone to potential overflow bugs.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6266#issuecomment-111076244,111076244,

laanwj,2015-06-11T08:35:36Z,"This absolutely needs review, but the changes look very sane to me. The buffer size is decreased from 4 to 3 because the last slot was only there to hold a terminating NUL character. This is no longer necessary because the new code counts characters. If this has an overflow bug, it was already there.\n\nI wonder one thing though: could we `push_back` the characters into `valStr` directly instead o",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6266#discussion_r32199734,32199734,src/univalue/univalue_read.cpp
domob1812,2015-06-11T09:24:56Z,"Exactly that was my rationale.  The buffer will only ever be accessed in the iterator range `[buf, last)`, and `last` itself is incremented at most three times.\n\nHowever, I like your suggestion of using `push_back` directly!  I think that makes sense and will rewrite the code accordingly.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6266#discussion_r32203234,32203234,src/univalue/univalue_read.cpp
