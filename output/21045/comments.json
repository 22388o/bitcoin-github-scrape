But I guess it does no harm other than the time it will take developers to read the documentation.\r\n\r\nRather than adding a new `ItemDefinitionGroup` could you add the new option to the common block that already exists at the bottom of `common.init.vcxproj`, e.g:\r\n\r\n````\r\n...\r\n      <AdditionalIncludeDirectories>..\\..\\src;..\\..\\src\\univalue\\include;..\\..\\src\\secp256k1\\include;..\\..\\src\\leveldb\\include;..\\..\\src\\leveldb\\helpers\\memenv;%(AdditionalIncludeDirectories)</AdditionalIncludeDirectories>\r\n    </ClCompile>\r\n    <Link>\r\n      <SubSystem>Console</SubSystem>\r\n      <AdditionalDependencies>Iphlpapi.lib;ws2_32.lib;Shlwapi.lib;kernel32.lib;user32.lib;gdi32.lib;comdlg32.lib;advapi32.lib;shell32.lib;ole32.lib;oleaut32.lib;uuid.lib;odbc32.lib;odbccp32.lib;%(AdditionalDependencies)</AdditionalDependencies>\r\n      <RandomizedBaseAddress>true</RandomizedBaseAddress>\r\n    </Link>\r\n    <Lib>\r\n      <AdditionalOptions>/ignore:4221</AdditionalOptions>\r\n    </Lib>\r\n...\r\n````",
