laanwj,2013-12-13T04:34:38Z,"I think I found this is not 100% reliable:\nENTER_CRITICAL_SECTION uses the stringified value of the argument passed in as the lock name. This works perfectly for global locks, however the wallet lock object is referred to differently based on the context\n\n```\nLOCK(cs_wallet)\nLOCK(pwallet->cs_wallet)\nLOCK(pwalletMain->cs_wallet)\n```\n\nNot sure how this could be avoided...\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3401#issuecomment-30486334,30486334,
laanwj,2013-12-18T07:33:31Z,I think I know a way to make AssertLockHeld work for non-global locks (also @gavinandresen): \n\nMake AssertLockHeld check the lock stack for the mutex pointer instead of the name.\n\nDoes this sound sane?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3401#issuecomment-30822174,30822174,
