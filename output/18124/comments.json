More specifically it does *not* disallow any configuration that is currently allowed. (Please correct me if you think I'm wrong.)\r\n\r\nI've worked a lot on removing the use of locale-dependent functions and I fail to see how that effort would be in conflict with documenting and asserting the currently made locale assumptions.\r\n\r\nIt is my understanding the following are the only possible effective locale combinations before _and_ after this PR:\r\n\r\n| Program        | C locale (`setlocale`) | Global C++ locale (`std::locale`) |\r\n| ------------- | ------------- | ----- |\r\n| `bitcoind`      | `C` (classic) | `C` (classic) |\r\n| `bitcoin-qt`      | User configured (no assumed locale) | `C` (classic) |\r\n\r\nIs that your understanding as well?\r\n\r\nPerhaps the suggestion is that we might want to change the current locale logic and allow for `bitcoind` to run with a C locale (`setlocale`) or global C++ locale (`std::locale`) other than the classic locale in the future? That sounds _really_ risky. The mere thought of an accidental fork/network split made possible by a locale dependency bug in combination with the fact that we would allow running `bitcoind` which an _effective_ non-classic C or C++ locale (think `zh_CN`!) gives me nightmares :)\r\n\r\nAgain, please correct me if my reasoning is wrong. I could be missing something :)",

    "body": "@sipa The only thing guaranteed by the language is that a C++ program has the C and C++ locales set to the classic locale when entering `main`. After that the user code is free to mess with the locale as it seen fit: hence the need to verify that the assumption we make hold true :)\r\n\r\nThere are quite a few gotchas that are worth guarding against in my opinion:\r\n\r\nA common gotcha is that `setlocale(LC_ALL, \"\")` (write) where `setlocale(LC_ALL, nullptr)` (read) was intended.\r\n\r\nAnother common gotcha is libraries calling `setlocale(LC_ALL, \"\")` without the application author being aware of it which of course messes with the locale of the entire application in unexpected ways.\r\n\r\nI think we have that problem today in the form of Qt which runs `std::setlocale(LC_ALL, \"\")` as part of its setup process. That is why the reported locale issues historically have popped up in `bitcoin-qt` and not in `bitcoind` AFAICT.",
