MarcoFalke,2019-10-30 14:13:11,Concept ACK. Reviewers should verify that the two requirements of the macro are fullfilled: https://dev.visucore.com/bitcoin/doxygen/check_8h.html#a46a3e27097aa5e94bbf62075bad7016f,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17318#issuecomment-547924385,547924385,

adamjonas,2019-10-30 14:44:28,Hmm. Looks like the linter is working (a little too well). Any suggestions on how I might relax the linter requirements? cc @MarcoFalke?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17318#discussion_r340658506,340658506,src/rpc/server.cpp
MarcoFalke,2019-10-30 14:47:44,"My suggestion would be to add an `ASSERT` macro to `check.h` that just does `assert()` for now.\n\nIn the short term this helps with documentation to explicitly distinguish cases `CHECK_NONFATAL` vs `ASSERT` (and to fix the linter). In the long term we can get rid of the default `assert` and replace it with our own shiny Bitcoin Core `ASSERT` (doing fancy things like logging or writing the trace",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17318#discussion_r340660772,340660772,src/rpc/server.cpp
