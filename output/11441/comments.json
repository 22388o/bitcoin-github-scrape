    "body": "> That would be a task for an independent PR. This is just for the server.\r\n\r\nThe interface for `bitcoin-cli` should be as close as possible to the RPC interface. It's a useful testing tool for people writing their own RPC clients, so we should avoid there being any surprises when switching between the two. In general, I don't think we should merge PRs that increase the delta between bitcoin-cli and the RPC interface.\r\n\r\n>> It also seems to break argument name checking.\r\n\r\n> Doesn't look broken to me.\r\n\r\nThe point is that this PR makes the error message less helpful for the user. That's a regression.\r\n\r\n> The motivation is to fix the named args interface.\r\n\r\nIt's not obvious to me that the named args interface needs 'fixing'. Named args are arguably better than an options object for a number of reasons:\r\n\r\n- name and type checking is provided for free by the `rpc/server` framework.\r\n- providers a simpler, flatter interface for client code.\r\n- options objects are really awkward to use with `bitcoin-cli` and shells.\r\n\r\n> But when using positional arguments, you'd have a terrible interface\r\n\r\nNo-one is suggesting that users should use positional arguments. Named args solve this problem already.",
