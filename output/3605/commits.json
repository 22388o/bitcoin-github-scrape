Shut down Bitcoin, then backup the wallet.dat file.\n+IMPORTANT: be sure to request a new bitcoin address before backing up, so that the 'keypool' is regenerated and backed up.\n+\n+\"Security in depth\" is always a good idea, so choosing a secure location for the backup and/or encrypting the backup before uploading it is recommended.

Just type \"sudo apt-add-repository ppa:bitcoin/bitcoin\" in your terminal, then install the bitcoin-qt package.\n+\n+MAJOR BUG FIX  (CVE-2011-4447)\n+\n+The wallet encryption feature introduced in Bitcoin version 0.4.0 did not sufficiently secure the private keys. An attacker who\n+managed to get a copy of your encrypted wallet.dat file might be able to recover some or all of the unencrypted keys and steal the\n+associated coins.\n+\n+If you have a previously encrypted wallet.dat, the first time you run bitcoin-qt or bitcoind the wallet will be rewritten, Bitcoin will\n+shut down, and you will be prompted to restart it to run with the new, properly encrypted file.\n+\n+If you had a previously encrypted wallet.dat that might have been copied or stolen (for example, you backed it up to a public\n+location) you should send all of your bitcoins to yourself using a new bitcoin address and stop using any previously generated addresses.\n+\n+Wallets encrypted with this version of Bitcoin are written properly.\n+\n+Technical note: the encrypted wallet's 'keypool' will be regenerated the first time you request a new bitcoin address; to be certain that the\n+new private keys are properly backed up you should:\n+\n+1. Run Bitcoin and let it rewrite the wallet.dat file\n+\n+2. Run it again, then ask it for a new bitcoin address.\n+Bitcoin-Qt: Address Book, then New Address...\n+bitcoind: run the 'walletpassphrase' RPC command to unlock the wallet,  then run the 'getnewaddress' RPC command.\n+\n+3. If your encrypted wallet.dat may have been copied or stolen, send  all of your bitcoins to the new bitcoin address.\n+\n+4. Shut down Bitcoin, then backup the wallet.dat file.\n+IMPORTANT: be sure to request a new bitcoin address before backing up, so that the 'keypool' is regenerated and backed up.\n+\n+\"Security in depth\" is always a good idea, so choosing a secure location for the backup and/or encrypting the backup before uploading it is recommended. And as in previous releases, if your machine is infected by malware there are several ways an attacker might steal your bitcoins.\n+\n+Thanks to Alan Reiner (etotheipi) for finding and reporting this bug.\n+\n+MAJOR GUI CHANGES\n+\n+\"Splash\" graphics at startup that show address/wallet/blockchain loading progress.\n+\n+\"Synchronizing with network\" progress bar to show block-chain download progress.\n+\n+Icons at the bottom of the window that show how well connected you are to the network, with tooltips to display details.\n+\n+Drag and drop support for bitcoin: URIs on web pages.\n+\n+Export transactions as a .csv file.\n+\n+Many other GUI improvements, large and small.\n+\n+RPC CHANGES\n+\n+getmemorypool : new RPC command, provides everything needed to construct a block with a custom generation transaction and submit a solution\n+\n+listsinceblock : new RPC command, list transactions since given block\n+\n+signmessage/verifymessage : new RPC commands to sign a message with one of your private keys or verify that a message signed by the private key associated with a bitcoin address.\n+\n+GENERAL CHANGES\n+\n+Faster initial block download."

Wait\n+until it has completely shut down (which might take a few minutes for older\n+versions), then run the installer (on Windows) or just copy over\n+/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on Mac) or bitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux).\n+\n+The first time you run after the upgrade a re-indexing process will be\n+started that will take anywhere from 30 minutes to several hours,\n+depending on the speed of your machine.\n+\n+Incompatible Changes\n+--------------------\n+\n+This release no longer maintains a full index of historical transaction ids\n+by default, so looking up an arbitrary transaction using the getrawtransaction\n+RPC call will not work. If you need that functionality, you must run once\n+with -txindex=1 -reindex=1 to rebuild block-chain indices (see below for more\n+details).\n+\n+Improvements\n+------------\n+\n+Mac and Windows binaries are signed with certificates owned by the Bitcoin\n+Foundation, to be compatible with the new security features in OSX 10.8 and\n+Windows 8.\n+\n+LevelDB, a fast, open-source, non-relational database from Google, is\n+now used to store transaction and block indices.  LevelDB works much better\n+on machines with slow I/O and is faster in general. Berkeley DB is now only\n+used for the wallet.dat file (public and private wallet keys and transactions\n+relevant to you).\n+\n+Pieter Wuille implemented many optimizations to the way transactions are\n+verified, so a running, synchronized node uses less working memory and does\n+much less I/O. He also implemented parallel signature checking, so if you\n+have a multi-CPU machine all CPUs will be used to verify transactions.\n+\n+New Features\n+------------\n+\n+\"Bloom filter\" support in the network protocol for sending only relevant transactions to\n+lightweight clients.\n+\n+contrib/verifysfbinaries is a shell-script to verify that the binary downloads\n+at sourceforge have not been tampered with. If you are able, you can help make\n+everybody's downloads more secure by running this occasionally to check PGP\n+signatures against download file checksums.\n+\n+contrib/spendfrom is a python-language command-line utility that demonstrates\n+how to use the \"raw transactions\" JSON-RPC api to send coins received from particular\n+addresses (also known as \"coin control\").\n+\n+New/changed settings (command-line or bitcoin.conf file)\n+--------------------------------------------------------\n+\n+dbcache : controls LevelDB memory usage.\n+\n+par : controls how many threads to use to validate transactions. Defaults to the number\n+of CPUs on your machine, use -par=1 to limit to a single CPU.\n+\n+txindex : maintains an extra index of old, spent transaction ids so they will be found\n+by the getrawtransaction JSON-RPC method.\n+\n+reindex : rebuild block and transaction indices from the downloaded block data.\n+\n+New JSON-RPC API Features\n+-------------------------\n+\n+lockunspent / listlockunspent allow locking transaction outputs for a period of time so\n+they will not be spent by other processes that might be accessing the same wallet.\n+\n+addnode / getaddednodeinfo methods, to connect to specific peers without restarting.\n+\n+importprivkey now takes an optional boolean parameter (default true) to control whether\n+or not to rescan the blockchain for transactions after importing a new private key.\n+\n+Important Bug Fixes\n+-------------------\n+\n+Privacy leak: the position of the \"change\" output in most transactions was not being\n+properly randomized, making network analysis of the transaction graph to identify\n+users' wallets easier. \n+\n+Zero-confirmation transaction vulnerability: accepting zero-confirmation transactions\n+(transactions that have not yet been included in a block) from somebody you do not\n+trust is still not recommended, because there will always be ways for attackers to\n+double-spend zero-confirmation transactions. However, this release includes a bug\n+fix that makes it a little bit more difficult for attackers to double-spend a\n+certain type (\"lockTime in the future\") of zero-confirmation transaction.\n+\n+Dependency Changes\n+------------------\n+\n+Qt 4.8.3 (compiling against older versions of Qt 4 should continue to work)\n+\n+\n+Thanks to everybody who contributed to this release:\n+----------------------------------------------------\n+\n+Alexander Kjeldaas\n+Andrey Alekseenko\n+Arnav Singh\n+Christian von Roques\n+Eric Lombrozo\n+Forrest Voight\n+Gavin Andresen\n+Gregory Maxwell\n+Jeff Garzik\n+Luke Dashjr\n+Matt Corallo\n+Mike Cassano\n+Mike Hearn\n+Peter Todd\n+Philip Kaufmann\n+Pieter Wuille\n+Richard Schwab\n+Robert Backhaus\n+Rune K.
