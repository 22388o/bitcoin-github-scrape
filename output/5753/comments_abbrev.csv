jonasschnelli,2015-02-04T20:44:36Z,@paveljanik Yes. This is a feature ... _cough slightly_.\nHaving a blue/green icon in testnet/regtest mode is fine IMO.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5753#issuecomment-72935094,72935094,
paveljanik,2015-02-04T20:52:51Z,BTW - I was talking about the color of the new added icon on the About window... I like the color of the intro image (both green and blue one!). Would like to see the same color in the About window as well :-)\nBut you can safely ignore this :-)\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5753#issuecomment-72936506,72936506,
jonasschnelli,2015-02-04T21:03:07Z,@paveljanik Yes. I know what you meant with that. I was just _cough slightly_ because i was aware of this inconsistence. It would certainly be fixable somehow. But the color of the icon gets rewritten and cached at the very beginning of the qt app cycle.\nI think it's not worth the effort because the green/blue icon will probably only popups on devs screens.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5753#issuecomment-72938618,72938618,

jonasschnelli,2015-02-07T12:10:09Z,@L-Cranston-Shadow First github comment. Nice. Thanks for your participation.\nThe resize behavior is still the same.\nYou can still resize the window to a very small size (see below).\nIn the current (0.9.3) and upcoming version 0.10 there is also a image on the about screen which follows the same resize constraints.\n\nFeel free to test it by building bitcoin master yourself of use a prebuilt bi,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5753#issuecomment-73361771,73361771,
