petertodd,2014-09-20T16:58:43Z,"I was nearly going to say ""why bother given we have the tx tests"", but actually really what you're doing is more explicitly defining the context that the script tests run in. I'm working on OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY, which looks like will probably need a broader notion of the context in which a script executes, but as this is purely a sane ""default context"" any further needs to modify the default can",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4949#issuecomment-56273487,56273487,

petertodd,2014-09-20T17:29:07Z,@sipa By putting the txid in the comment it makes it easy to figure out if you're code to make a new testcase is reproducing the coinbase tx properly; easy to imagine it being frustrating trying to figure out why it's not working. Also makes it easy to check if anything changes somehow via an unrelated change that makes the coinbase tx creation code change.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4949#issuecomment-56274381,56274381,
