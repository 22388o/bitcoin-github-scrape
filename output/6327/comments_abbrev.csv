Please don't make it controversial if it works or give a better/easier solution and post a pull, thanks.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6327#issuecomment-114635593,114635593,

penguin1333,2015-06-23T20:50:41Z,"I'd say to just go with it. If it removes warnings, then less confusion :)\n\nI didn't really review the code very much, but from what is said it does, it sounds good to me.\n\n(Again, I did not read the code. I glanced at it, nor have I tested it.)\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6327#issuecomment-114638567,114638567,

Diapolo,2015-07-03T05:17:36Z,"@laanwj This is weird, as your solution (current master) doesn't fix the warning, while my patch and also Lukes did fix it. My idea was to get this fixed without such a discussion...\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6327#issuecomment-118238024,118238024,
laanwj,2015-07-03T07:57:24Z,"@diapolo My point in #6328 is that non-breaking platform specific style differences should be based on a runtime decision, not on #ifdefs (or maybe one set of #ifdef at the initialization of the program, which can be overridden using an option).
