The trouble is, it's not comprehensive and it's not easy to create a comprehensive scripted-diff given regex strings are not always directly connected with `re.` calls.

laanwj,2019-01-25T16:13:59Z,"As I commented on your previous request, turning these into raw strings is not correct. This is **not a pure refactor** and changes the meaning of the code.\n```python\n>>> r""Satoshi Nakamoto\n"" == ""Satoshi Nakamoto\n""\nFalse\n```\n\nRaw strings are unnecessary here. If you want to avoid the warning stop escaping `.` as `\,`, e.g.\n```patch\n- ""The LevelDB Authors\.

Empact,2019-01-26T09:45:40Z,"If you run those strings against `re` instead you'll see something different.

Empact,2019-01-26T09:59:27Z,Another way to look at this is comparing the script output with master.
