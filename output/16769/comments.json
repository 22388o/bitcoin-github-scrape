    "body": "Let's clear some things out.\r\n1. Windows 2000 and Windows XP use the same registry structure as Windows 10 (version 5.00). Of course Windows 7/8/Vista also use v5.00.\r\nMore info [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/310516/how-to-add-modify-or-delete-registry-subkeys-and-values-by-using-a-reg).\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Registry keys are like folders, while registry values are like files within folders. Don't mix them.\r\nNSIS Bitcoin uninstaller script right now removes values first and keys later. This is unnecessary.\r\nThe original author of the script must have done this under the pretense that registry keys have to be completely empty to be deleted when using the `/IfEmpty` flag. This is not true. As described in the [link](https://nsis.sourceforge.io/mediawiki/index.php?title=Reference/DeleteRegKey&oldid=21290) you have sent before, /IfEmpty flag looks for subkeys, not values.\r\nSince those registry keys in question don't have any subkeys, the lines `DeleteRegKey /IfEmpty` will delete the key with all its values. If a user should create a subkey him/herself, the key would not be deleted since it would not be \"empty\".",

The result will be the same if we make the change or not. I simply deleted unnecessary lines and made the uninstall process cleaner.
