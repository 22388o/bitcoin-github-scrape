gmaxwell,2014-12-08T06:50:45Z,"Hm. Breaking the symmetry here is odd but may be prudent, resulting in one less (of many) fingerprinting vectors.

jgarzik,2014-12-08T22:51:50Z,"A nearly-empty addrman is what you have on testnet and other less populated networks.  addrman still has some pathological behavior in that area, such as trying the same few addresses over and over again.  It would be a shame to increase the pathlogical behavior.\n\nNot completely convinced increasing the level of assemetry here has value from a Sybil perspective, but it might.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5442#issuecomment-66203461,66203461,
