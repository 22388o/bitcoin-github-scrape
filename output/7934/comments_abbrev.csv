laanwj,2016-12-21T08:49:27Z,"> I'd like to understand this code - where do I start?\n\nIn this case it is the theory that is important to understand. With that, the code is pretty straightforward. Google ""bloom filters"". Most notably the wikipedia page about Bloom filters has a lot of references to CS literature about various kinds of bloom filters, and the article itself may give basic understanding.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7934#issuecomment-268468925,268468925,
