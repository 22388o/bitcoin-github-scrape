There is no reason that we should run python script with some specific environment variable. Also, you can't guarantee that everyone run the python script from command line like someone can run it with double-clicking the python file. Furthermore, this would prevent encoding issue forever ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14265#issuecomment-422637052,422637052,
MarcoFalke,2018-09-19T03:29:01Z,"We require python3, which follows PEP 3120. Explicitly setting the encoding should only be needed when it is not utf-8.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14265#issuecomment-422638193,422638193,
ken2812221,2018-09-19T04:25:28Z,"Oh, it appears to be a mistake running the script with python2. I remember I met this issue before when I was testing #14007, but it seems that the problem is the ouput encoding, I'll try to solve it in another way.
