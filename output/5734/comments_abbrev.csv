jonasschnelli,2015-02-02T08:34:14Z,ACK `init.cpp` and `bitcoin-cli.cpp` changes (except copyright year header)\nNACK `INSTALL.md` and `README.md` changes.\nIt would also be nice if this could get squashed to 1 commit.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5734#issuecomment-72421657,72421657,

lucayepa,2015-02-02T16:46:11Z,"This file is used on servers as well. You ""cat"", ""less"" or ""view"" it. A lot of servers are set on ASCII-only in order to be less buggy while editing configuration files. Call it UX for sysadmin, but all the servers I work with display those chars as spurious chars.
