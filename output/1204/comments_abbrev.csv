Diapolo,2012-05-07T08:12:02Z,Rebased and reworked to be Qt < 4.7 compatible by using setPlaceholderText in the code instead of the ui-file.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1204#issuecomment-5545542,5545542,
laanwj,2012-05-07T12:12:20Z,"Good!\n\nBtw, I think it is confusing that there are two slots gotoMessagePage. If you want, you can consolidate the gotoMessagePage to one slot that takes a QString argument that defaults to the empty string. Then add:\n\n```\nif(!addr.isEmpty())\n    messagePage->setAddress(addr);\n```\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1204#issuecomment-5548644,5548644,
Diapolo,2012-05-07T12:56:37Z,@laanwj I added your suggestion and consolidated gotoMessagePage() into 1 function.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1204#issuecomment-5549354,5549354,

Diapolo,2012-05-07T11:25:56Z,If I set the focus on an element in a widget instead of the widget itself ... perhaps I find the answer via a web-search. Sounds pretty logical though.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1204#discussion_r780620,780620,src/qt/bitcoingui.cpp
Diapolo,2012-05-07T11:55:36Z,"As the MessagePage has set the flag focusPolicy = NoFocus (which is the default), I'm rather sure the setFocus() had no function before! And signFrom has focusPolicy = StrongFocus, which allows setting the focus to.\n\nSee http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/qt.html#FocusPolicy-enum\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1204#discussion_r780707,780707,src/qt/bitcoingui.cpp
