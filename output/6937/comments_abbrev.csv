laanwj,2015-11-04T09:50:17Z,"Though something is clearly going wrong in boost cross-compilation, \n- the host platform should not influence in any way what gets passed to the target compiler\n- according to `man gcc`, m32/m64 is _only_ supported on ""i386 and x86-64"" so I think it would make sense to make the condition the other way around instead of a platform blacklist when _not_ to pass it\n\nArguably an upstream issue and ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6937#issuecomment-153663512,153663512,
fanquake,2015-11-05T13:34:36Z,Looks like this has been fixed upstream in https://github.com/boostorg/build/commit/cbddcde5953c8e51f52bfe612f53d0b779ade5f3\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6937#issuecomment-154059978,154059978,
laanwj,2015-11-05T22:10:24Z,Thanks @fanquake . Seems what they did is:\n\n```\n-            if $(arch) != arm\n+            if $(arch) = power || $(arch) = sparc || $(arch) = x86\n```\n\nWhich is better as it explicitly defines which platforms can use -mXX (didn't know about power and sparc).\n\nAn alternative would be to bump boost to 1.59 (which includes this). Seems to work fine in local testing.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6937#issuecomment-154211204,154211204,
