sipa,2011-08-14T15:19:19Z,"I haven't tested it, but it looks correct - a bit of a hack though. Wouldn't it be nicer to have a\n\nbool GetKeyFromPool(vector<unsigned char> &vchPubKey, bool fAllowReuse = true)\n\nfunction which can fail, and call that with fAllowReuse=false in GetAccountAddress?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/467#issuecomment-1801906,1801906,

TheBlueMatt,2011-08-30T16:28:19Z,Might want to put a cs around this\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/467#discussion_r107152,107152,src/wallet.cpp
