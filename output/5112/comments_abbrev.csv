laanwj,2014-10-21T09:21:14Z,"I prefer to not enforce any specific build order to leave space for maximum parallelism.\n\nBut I see that this just switches around the order which is fine by me. I'd only suggest to add a comment why it is this way, to avoid people changing it again.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5112#issuecomment-59900754,59900754,
theuni,2014-10-21T16:56:01Z,"ACK in principle, but this needs to be reordered for the bin targets as well. This fixes the general ""make"" and ""make check"" cases, but not the specific cases like ""make bitcoind"". See below for (untested) changes needed in addition to yours.\n\nAlso, this will work itself out soon anyway as we begin shifting libs around as a core lib starts to emerge, but I have no issue with rearranging before t",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5112#issuecomment-59960101,59960101,
laanwj,2014-10-22T08:14:13Z,"@theuni The order of libraries in the linking phase is important, if LIBBITCOIN_SERVER uses symbols from LIBBITCOIN_COMMON then they should be in that order. Right? I don't think reordering them in the binaries is as harmless as @jtimon's change.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5112#issuecomment-60050410,60050410,
theuni,2014-10-24T03:44:27Z,"@laanwj Yes, of course. Ignore that comment.\n\nBuilding for specific targets will still go in the old order, but @jtimon's change is still an improvement.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5112#issuecomment-60341380,60341380,
