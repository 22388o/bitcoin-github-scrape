laanwj,2016-01-18T10:55:17Z,"> Concept ACK. Do any RPC tests need this set for them?\n\nI don't think this is used by any RPC tests. This was introduced because of testnet-in-a-box, which we don't use for RPC tests. @MarcoFalke's test seems to confirm this.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7208#issuecomment-172496904,172496904,
jtimon,2016-01-03T19:36:25Z,"minor nit, maybe \n\n```\nnMaxTipAge = GetArg(""-maxtipage"", nMaxTipAge);\n```\n\nto not use DEFAULT_MAX_TIP_AGE twice (nMaxTipAge is already initialized to DEFAULT_MAX_TIP_AGE in main.cpp, this seems a little bit redundant)?\nAnyway, minor minor minor style nit. Feel more than free to ignore.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7208#discussion_r48696149,48696149,src/init.cpp
laanwj,2016-01-18T10:54:17Z,"I've always tried to avoid using the current value as default anywhere for GetArg. Specifying DEFAULT_MAX_TIP_AGE is more clear when reading the code, and when at some point argument parsing is refactored it's nice to have the defaults on hand without having to 'reason back' about the value.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7208#discussion_r49984684,49984684,src/init.cpp
MarcoFalke,2016-01-18T10:58:44Z,@jtimon We use the `DEFAULT_*` values to make it easier to implement #1044.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7208#discussion_r49985201,49985201,src/init.cpp
jtimon,2016-01-19T10:56:37Z,"It's  fine, as said it was a very minor nit. Maybe we can remove  the redundant initialization in main.cpp?\nWhatever we do, I'm fine, as long as we try to be consistent  among all the globals (which imo should be in globals/server.o of something of the short instead of main chainparams, etc [globals/common.o could take the globals in unit.o and basechainparams, for example]; but one step a a time",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7208#discussion_r50098573,50098573,src/init.cpp
