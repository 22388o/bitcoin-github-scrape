It chanages paths in makefile.linux-mingw or otherwise changes build scripts in a way that made them incompatible with the automated testing scripts (please tweak those patches in qa/pull-tester)\n2. It adds/modifies tests which test network rules (thanks for doing that), which conflicts with a patch applied at test time\n3. It does not build on either Linux i386 or Win32 (via MinGW cross compile)\n4. The test suite fails on either Linux i386 or Win32\n5. The block test-cases failed (lookup the first bNN identifier which failed in https://github.com/TheBlueMatt/test-scripts/blob/master/FullBlockTestGenerator.java)\n\nIf you believe this to be in error, please ping BlueMatt on freenode or TheBlueMatt here.\n\nThis test script verifies pulls every time they are updated. It, however, dies sometimes and fails to test properly.  If you are waiting on a test, please check timestamps to verify that the test.log is moving at http://jenkins.bluematt.me/pull-tester/current/\nContact BlueMatt on freenode if something looks broken.\n",

    "body": "NACK. I was originally for this, but after a discussion on IRC last night, I've revisited it after learning that gcc 4.8 hasn't landed in stable debian or gentoo yet.\n\nC++11 is essentially a new language. Only \"allowing\" part of it would be a nightmare for maintenance.\n\nC++11 cannot be used in any reasonable sense until gcc 4.8/clang 3.4. If the decision is to move towards c++11 support, this _must_ be the floor for supported compilers. Anything less means that only a subset of the language can be used, which greatly reduces the value of the move in the first place.\n\nIf the benefits of this move are limited to the ones in this PR, or some similar subset, then the value has been missed. Arguably the biggest change to the language is that of rvalue references and move semantics, and those tend to infect code (in a good way imo) with concepts that correspond. In particular: rvalue references quickly move to perfect forwarding, which brings in variadic macros and constexpr functions as helpers. Those bring in lambdas for convenience, which pull in std::function and std::bind naturally. It keeps going from there. Same goes for type traits and SFINAE. They are hugely useful, but once they're used in a few places, they spread out everywhere.\n\nThe above are good things imo, and very worthwhile. But many just plain don't work until gcc4.8/clang 3.4. Imagine if (simplistic example) we had to set a policy where 'for' loops were allowed in code, but 'while' loops weren't due to compiler support concerns. How could contributors keep up? How could reviews take place?\n\nTldr; This needs to be all or nothing. Either the language requirements move to c++11 or they don't, but not some in-between concept. When the supporting compilers are ubiquitous enough for devs, that's the time to move.\n",

Of course, if C++11 has drop-in replacements for what Boost has, moving to those more standard solutions is nice, but just an incremental thing.\n\nWhether it makes sense to just have the small incremental improvements, while making our build environment constraints harder... unsure.\n",

It chanages paths in makefile.linux-mingw or otherwise changes build scripts in a way that made them incompatible with the automated testing scripts (please tweak those patches in qa/pull-tester)\n2. It adds/modifies tests which test network rules (thanks for doing that), which conflicts with a patch applied at test time\n3. It does not build on either Linux i386 or Win32 (via MinGW cross compile)\n4. The test suite fails on either Linux i386 or Win32\n5. The block test-cases failed (lookup the first bNN identifier which failed in https://github.com/TheBlueMatt/test-scripts/blob/master/FullBlockTestGenerator.java)\n\nIf you believe this to be in error, please ping BlueMatt on freenode or TheBlueMatt here.\n\nThis test script verifies pulls every time they are updated. It, however, dies sometimes and fails to test properly.  If you are waiting on a test, please check timestamps to verify that the test.log is moving at http://jenkins.bluematt.me/pull-tester/current/\nContact BlueMatt on freenode if something looks broken.\n",

    "body": "OK, closing this PR.  Consensus has matched a familiar pattern which I hope serves as a template to move forward.\n\n1) Bitcoin is not going to be a first mover on new language features.\n\n2) boost::int64_t deserves a quick and violent death.  All our platforms can handle stdint.h types such as int64_t or uint64_t.  That commit in this PR useful.\n\n3) Other commits, like std::pair use are good too.\n\n4) In general, where older platforms permit, we should prefer the std C++ feature to a boost feature, unless there is a very clear win.\n\n5) As these comments may already hint, the proper avenue for C++11 in bitcoin (or any long maintenance codebase) is to work each codebase mutation in parallel, in separate pull requests.  Some changes will go right in.  Other changes will not or cannot without breaking.\n\nIn general you want to form a strategy not of abrupt change, but slow change over time so that the codebase is ready by the time C++11 is widely available and tested in various Long Term Support (new fancy name for \"stable\") distributions.\n\nMost of the commits were already in that vein, but wrapping them all into a single PR was not the way to go.\n",
