morcos,2016-02-10T13:48:43Z,@sipa Why is it necessary to have the call to MarkConflicted from the fFromLoadWallet code block in the first place?  I assume that's the call site that causes this problem?\n\nOK Thanks for the answer on IRC. It's for backwards compatibility so conflict information is created (to the extent possible) for pre-0.12 wallets.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7491#issuecomment-182384200,182384200,
laanwj,2016-02-10T13:51:10Z,">  I assume that's the call site that causes this problem?\n\nYes (the other callsite should never hit this, as it is called with a block that has just become the new tip).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7491#issuecomment-182384817,182384817,
