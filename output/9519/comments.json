So if that number drops significantly it'll be worth revisiting.  Beyond that, it shouldn't matter if a bunch of high fee txs aren't tracked as long as enough still are to give you the data you need.\r\n\r\n@luke-jr sigh...  sure, estimates should be magical and give you perfect answers.  But whether this is the optimal algorithm is not the question here.  The question is whether this is a reasonable improvement and I believe it is.",

    "body": "@dcousens The issue is that if some significant fraction of miners don't accept RBF replacements but your node does, then you would expect them to get mined quickly based on their fee rate but in reality it will take longer.   In the worst case situation this can lead fee estimation to think that all transactions of that fee rate would take longer to be confirmed.  \r\n\r\n If you know that some miners are not considering a certain subset of transactions for block inclusion, its better to eliminate those as potential data points for fee estimation.  There are two opposing arguments to this:\r\n1. You've eliminated so many transactions that you don't have a big enough sample of data points. (Not a concern here)\r\n2. What if the particular transaction you are placing is of the type that is chosen to be excluded for fee estimation because its disadvantaged.  This is a reason to not overly narrow the policy profile required for fee estimation.  But in the case of replacement transactions, I think its relatively well known that not all miners might accept your replacement, and in the case they don't, the alternative is your original transaction is still mined, so its probably ok if fee estimates are maybe not perfectly tailored to your particular transaction.",

In our case there certainly isn't enough data now to give an answer for replacements on their own, so we might as well exclude replacements from the regular transaction data so we are giving an unpolluted answer for regular transactions at least.\r\n\r\nIn other words its no harm done if they aren't really subject to different policy.

While this is true, miners (in this case pools) have shown both a) long lags from incentivization to when they start adopting things which pay them more (eg many miners are still leaving lots on the table by not using 0.13 to do CPFP), and b) willingness to ignore incentivization when there is community drama - its not their income that they're losing out on, its their clients.\r\n\r\nOn the flip side, I do buy that opt-in RBF will continue to get some additional adoption because of the big UX win for some wallets by using it, and while its useable today because there is some adoption from miners, the inconsistency of said adoption makes including it for fee esimation very painful.\r\n\r\nFinally, the way this is written, it is trivial to revert even in a point release if we decide things have upgraded faster than we thought.\r\n\r\nStrong Concept ACK.",
