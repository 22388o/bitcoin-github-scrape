theuni,2017-04-20T14:17:25Z,"Yes, that should be the case now. For some reason automake doesn't push the autoheader rules down to subdirs, so it was never re-triggered if you build from src/.\n\nThinking about it now, we should probably backport this for 0.14.2 as well, since switching branches is one of the most common ways this problem can show up.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10228#issuecomment-295754079,295754079,
