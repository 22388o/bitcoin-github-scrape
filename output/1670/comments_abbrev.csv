sipa,2012-08-17T13:03:44Z,"I believe @gmaxwell argued in an earlier request for just using the full string. I wouldn't mind, and it enables using getblock directly, for example, without extra lookup. It's still a debug log file, right?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1670#issuecomment-7817221,7817221,
laanwj,2012-08-20T19:03:22Z,"How long is the full string? 64? I suppose so. This patch makes it print 48 characters, so I guess you could just as well go all the way print the full string.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1670#issuecomment-7879762,7879762,
luke-jr,2012-08-20T19:13:06Z,"No, this patch _skips_ 48 characters, so prints 16. I don't care either way, and it seems there's support for the full hash, so might as well do that anyway...\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1670#issuecomment-7880061,7880061,

rebroad,2012-09-01T15:11:37Z,So.. this patch now makes the lines in debug.log longer instead of shorter?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1670#issuecomment-8213729,8213729,
jgarzik,2012-09-04T16:07:42Z,"ACK save for bikeshedding:  ""BlockSubstr"" is a misleading name, because the end result of this changeset is not a substring, but rather the full hash string.  Maybe ""BlockHashStr"".\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1670#issuecomment-8268711,8268711,

rebroad,2012-09-05T12:08:05Z,How long will the line in the debug.log file now be with this change? What width of window is needed for it to look sufficiently neat? Is it worth adding a command line option to specify the length or format of the block string perhaps?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1670#issuecomment-8295829,8295829,
luke-jr,2012-09-05T13:21:35Z,It's a debug log; it doesn't have to look neat. NACK on a command line option...\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1670#issuecomment-8297552,8297552,
laanwj,2012-09-05T14:32:24Z,Agree with @luke-jr here. The point of the log is simply to give as much as\npossible info for debugging issues.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1670#issuecomment-8300753,8300753,
