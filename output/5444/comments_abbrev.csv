It might end up in different parameter injection. getutxos uses raw post data.\n/rest/headers/notxdetails/ uses flag/parameter in the URL?\n\nWould /rest/headers/limit/2000/<hash>.ext be a overkill?\n\nBut maybe the query string parameter is more clear.\n\n2)\nIs there a rea,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5444#issuecomment-66117350,66117350,
laanwj,2014-12-09T08:57:23Z,"- Concept looks good to me\n- I agree we don't really need a JSON format. If the purpose for this is to be a low-overhead API, we should stay away from JSON\n- As for parameters (such as start, limit), for a REST interface I'd prefer them to be all to be part of the query path instead of introducing `?=` parameters. `?=` parameters are non-canonical in that they can be provided in any order, which",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5444#issuecomment-66251851,66251851,
jonasschnelli,2014-12-09T12:25:21Z,Regarding JSON:\nIs there a reason to not support JSON? I think there are many potential REST users using script programming languages like Python or PHP. The unpacking of the byte array is somehow annoying in these languages and people might tend to have a overhead in the information transmission protocol (TCP/HTTP/JSON in this case) and save some development effort.\nWe could even say HTTP is a ,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5444#issuecomment-66275012,66275012,
laanwj,2014-12-09T12:50:17Z,"Packing/unpacking byte arrays is well-supported in Python, I do that all the time, that's a bit of a strawman. See also https://github.com/petertodd/python-bitcoinlib .\n\nAnyhow: headers have a well-defined format, and for hashing and such you really need the canonical, raw data. A ""cooked"" version would be much less useful. It could be added later but I doubt there is actual demand for it.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5444#issuecomment-66277756,66277756,
