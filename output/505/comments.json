Up to about 20 generated blocks now.\n\nMy Ubuntu skills are lacking, the txids look unique to me; but obviously that's not good enough. Any help with http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/706/how-do-i-sort-the-output-of-listtransactions would be appreciated.\n\nLastly, I'm not familiar with RPC - is there any resource for how I would do a getwork call wtih RPC?\n",
