jonasschnelli,2016-11-10T07:21:27Z,"Yes. It's a challenge and involves writing to specific developers.\nBut IMO – unencrypted emails – slightly defeats the purpose of ""responsible disclosed submitting"" of security critical issues.\nBut we can discuss that further on https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoincore.org\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9115#issuecomment-259619047,259619047,
