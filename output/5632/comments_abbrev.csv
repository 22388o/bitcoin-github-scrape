jonasschnelli,2015-01-16T10:50:28Z,Removed the `RES_IMAGES` part.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5632#issuecomment-70237470,70237470,

Diapolo,2015-01-09T22:34:43Z,"Thanks, I already asked if the resize in the initial pull was done by intention and got a yes. It was too small IMHO, so good one here!\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5632#discussion_r22748300,22748300,src/qt/forms/helpmessagedialog.ui
jonasschnelli,2015-01-10T07:09:27Z,I wasn't sure about that. Maybe we should keep the compile process open for further images.\nThat's why I left it. But I'm not sure.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5632#discussion_r22757113,22757113,src/Makefile.qt.include
zander,2015-01-13T06:28:30Z,I suggest removing it since you now set it to empty; so if someone adds another RES_IMAGES to the top of the file you end up deleting it again with this one.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5632#discussion_r22845132,22845132,src/Makefile.qt.include
laanwj,2015-01-16T10:25:13Z,"I'd say keep it empty. If there are images again, they can be added here. There's no need to add another RES_IMAGES to the top of the file.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5632#discussion_r23072548,23072548,src/Makefile.qt.include
