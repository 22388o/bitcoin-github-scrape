    "body": "Yes, it will be cloned. The files in the subtree are plain, ordinary repository files. You can modify and commit them, rename, them, delete them, etc... What git-subtree does is create a special 'merge' commit that ties in the commit log from the source repository (https://github.com/vinniefalco/LevelDB in this case) so that later on, you can pull a newer version of the subtree. And you can also 'split' any changes that are made to the LevelDB files and push them back to the original repository. It's the ideal alternative to the mess that is git-submodule. No tools or steps are needed (although note that git-subtree is part of the official Git distribution now).\n\nI plan on integrating Bitcoin's LevelDB changes into the latest tip of the LevelDB master branch so once that's ready, it will be possible to bring Bitcoin's version of LevelDB up to date. Here's a little promo for git-subtree:\n\nhttp://makingsoftware.wordpress.com/2013/02/16/using-git-subtrees-for-repository-separation/\n",

I'm using submodules in another project, and though I'm not too comfortable with it, it seems to work.\n\nI don't know about subtrees - will read - but if it requires separate tools (at least Ubuntu doesn't seem to have it), it will complicate our deterministic build environment.\n\nEDIT: as subtree seems to leave a copy of the code inside the including project, it shouldn't cause any build issues.\n",

    "body": "@Diapolo No. git-subtree does not store the location of the repo. The foreign repo is only accessed at the time you issue the appropriate git-subtree command. Other than when you are running a git-subtree command, the files are normal repository files like everything else. There is nothing magical or special about them, other than they have a few extra lines in the commit message that help the git-subtree script figure things out. Git-subtree only does things that you could do manually yourself, the structure of the repository is not hacked.\n\nThe reason that I have created my own LevelDB repo (at https://github.com/vinniefalco/LevelDB) is so that I could recreate the \"bitcoin-fork\" branch, which includes all of the changes made by the Bitcoin developers replayed on top of the commit log from the original LevelDB (stored at google code). You can see this recreated history here:\nhttps://github.com/vinniefalco/LevelDB/commits/bitcoin-fork\n\nNotice how sipa's changes are all there, and if you keep going back in time you will find the place where Bitcoin forked LevelDB. When LevelDB was added to bitcoin, they did it by just manually plopping the files into the source code hierarchy and making a commit. By doing so, the history of LevelDB was not carried over and therefore it is difficult to submit changes back to the upstream (the google code repo in this case).\n\nWhat I have done is to recreate the commit log including bitcoin's changes, and turn it into a proper branch called 'bitcoin-fork' located in my repository (URL above). Then I used git-subtree to replace the detached LevelDB sources in the bitcoin repo with an identical set of sources that also carries the history with it. This allows me to recreate the fork with any new changes that you guys make to LevelDB, so that I can submit it to the upstream.\n\nThe repository here:\nhttps://github.com/vinniefalco/LevelDB/commits/bitcoin-fork\n\nIs not needed by the bitcoin developers. You can simply continue on the way you did before, editing LevelDB sources as needed. At any time, I can pull your changes and split them into my bitcoin-fork branch. I can also cherry pick commits from the upstream LevelDB repo, commit them to my bitcoin-fork branch, and then submit a pull request so they can get into Bitcoin. This is how I brought in the 1.10.0 update as well as the fix for the Windows deadlocking.\n\nIf you guys want to do this yourself I can show you how to use subtree. It is quite easy. If you want to use your own repository to store your fork of leveldb (e.g. at bitcoin/leveldb) you could fork mine, or clone mine and push it to your own empty repo (at bitcoin/leveldb) so that it appears as an original and not a fork (at which point I can delete my repo and fork yours). Its worth repeating that none of this affects the subtree, because the repo URI is not stored anywhere. It's just a remote in your local repo (on any developer's computer who wants to issue git-subtree commands). You don't need to use git-subtree to edit the resulting files. You only need to use git-subtree if you want to do the following:\n\n1) Pull in commits from the external repository\n2) Submit a pull request for local changes to the upstream (i.e. the google code repo or bitcoin's fork of it)\n\nOr you could just continue on and pretend that LevelDB has no external repository, making changes to the sources as if they were your own - I can always step in and maintain the 'bitcoin-fork' branch no matter what you do, no action is required on your part unless you want to learn git-subtree and maintain the fork branch yourself.\n",
