fanquake,2018-11-17T14:20:18Z,I'd suggest moving this down between the Depends and Installation sections of the build doc. Someone is not going to be able to run `make deploy` unless that have already completed the steps for a 32/64 bit build.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14744#issuecomment-439620576,439620576,

LucianaMarques,2018-11-17T15:53:04Z,"I didn't understand your comment. Should I replace 'binary file' to 'binary installer', or the commands in the terminal should run in 's/binary file/binary installer/' directory?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14744#discussion_r234412600,234412600,doc/build-windows.md

laanwj,2018-11-23T07:29:29Z,"I think you should mention that it should be installed *before* running `./configure`, if you install it just before the `make` step in the steps below it's not going to work.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14744#discussion_r235859689,235859689,doc/build-windows.md
