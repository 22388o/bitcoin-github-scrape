Are those the headers without the block hash of the real testnet3 chain?  Because I don't see the checkpoint hash in there. Also, rather than having two lines with `fork:` and a parser to deal with that, maybe just hard code those in the test itself? Alternatively, create a seperat",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16551#issuecomment-522017746,522017746,
