    "body": "I think that it makes the argument clearer.  Also, it could be used to get completely rid of the `setup_network` functions in some of the tests if taken a bit further.  I wanted to submit this first to get initial feedback before spending more time, though.  But yes, I realise that it is probably a matter of taste.\n\nNote that at least some of the added lines of code are probably due to more prevalent line breaks in my coding style than in some of the replaced code.  Also more savings will come when removing some `setup_network` functions becomes possible.\n",

    "body": "I like test cases to be nitty-gritty and explicit. This makes them easier to understand, or at least, makes it easier to understand what actually happens. Deeper abstractions make it harder to troubleshoot, or for 'outsiders' to change the tests when necessary for code changes.\n\nSo I also tend towards NACK here. Currently we specify the exact arguments that are fed into bitcoind in every test. This would bury it in more Python syntactic sugar.\n",
