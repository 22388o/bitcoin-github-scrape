I can reproduce it on OS X, as well as on my own Arch Linux dev box, but not on Debian.\n\nOn Arch I can get it to work by compiling python from a tarball (instead of using the version from arch's package manager), so I think it's a problem with python/ctypes, and not something weird in the code or libssl.\n\nIt does seem to",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6523#issuecomment-128822463,128822463,
TheBlueMatt,2015-08-09T19:37:39Z,"While I love the idea of ditching the existing comparison tool, rewriting it as-is seems like a very bad idea. The existing one is very hard to work with in large part because of the way the tests are generated - it's one big monolithic step-by-step. It really needs to separate out into something where individual tests are in individual functions/modules/whatever.
