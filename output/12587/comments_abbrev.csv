jonasschnelli,2018-04-08T14:39:14Z,I guess this makes no longer sense after #10762. Closing.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12587#issuecomment-379555436,379555436,
promag,2018-03-06T14:10:02Z,"Between the above call `HasWallets()` and `GetWalletAtPos()` the wallet can be unloaded. Not possible at the moment, but maybe we should take the opportunity to add a lock to `g_wallet_manager`?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12587#discussion_r172526354,172526354,src/qt/rpcconsole.cpp

promag,2018-03-06T14:13:04Z,Could be initialized here?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12587#discussion_r172527240,172527240,src/wallet/walletmanager.cpp
promag,2018-03-06T14:27:56Z,Why not just return a copy of the array?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12587#discussion_r172531877,172531877,src/wallet/walletmanager.h
jonasschnelli,2018-03-18T08:39:39Z,I think a lambda is more flexible... same reason we use it in `CNode`/`g_conman`.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12587#discussion_r175281371,175281371,src/wallet/walletmanager.h
jonasschnelli,2018-03-18T09:16:55Z,Indeed. The locking would be the next step (not only for this case). But its out of scope for this PR.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12587#discussion_r175282222,175282222,src/qt/rpcconsole.cpp
jonasschnelli,2018-03-18T09:20:59Z,Indeed. Fixed.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12587#discussion_r175282328,175282328,src/wallet/walletmanager.cpp
promag,2018-03-26T22:15:23Z,"In `g_connman` makes sense because `cs_vNodes` is held all the time. Here we don't have locks. Even when we add dynamic wallets, IMHO the same pattern doesn't apply here.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12587#discussion_r177251759,177251759,src/wallet/walletmanager.h
jonasschnelli,2018-03-27T12:08:29Z,"IMO, once we add the locking (not the scope of this PR), then it makes more sense to keep the locking inside of the manager instead of returning a copy.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12587#discussion_r177399914,177399914,src/wallet/walletmanager.h
