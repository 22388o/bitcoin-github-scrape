Perhaps you can do the second change in a follow up, but I agree it should not be mixed with the fix.\n\nAlso, please squash the two commits.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15140#issuecomment-463517296,463517296,

MarcoFalke,2019-01-10T17:22:00Z,Can you explain what `cut here` and `orig version` means? I think those are confusion to test readers.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15140#discussion_r246849374,246849374,src/test/script_p2sh_tests.cpp
kodslav,2019-01-10T17:40:03Z,"Oh, sorry my commit comment was a bit short.\n\nI've made two versions of the fix since I didn't know what you prefer.\n\nThe orig version is clearer in what it fixes.\nThe block below that is perhaps less code, though not perhaps the quickest to understand at-a-glance.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15140#discussion_r246855534,246855534,src/test/script_p2sh_tests.cpp

MarcoFalke,2019-02-13T22:03:01Z,Could you either please remove the comments here or remove the whole second hunk. I think the fixup should be standalone and minimal.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15140#discussion_r256608551,256608551,src/test/script_p2sh_tests.cpp
