gavinandresen,2013-10-04T04:32:57Z,"NACK on the else if (howmuch == 0).  That is dead code, because the only two places Misbehaving(0) can happen are the two places where you put checks to not call Misbehaving in the first place.\n\nEither keep the checks, or just have Misbehaving(0) simply do if howmuch == 0 return;\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3047#issuecomment-25676018,25676018,
Diapolo,2013-10-04T08:13:47Z,@gavinandresen Updated and removed the `else if (howmuch == 0)`. Should be fine now.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3047#issuecomment-25682584,25682584,

laanwj,2013-10-04T10:07:50Z,ACK\n\nThough I must say the code is a bit confusing to read. The argument of state.IsInvalid(nDoS) is an inout argument which is then checked in the same if() clause.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3047#issuecomment-25688776,25688776,
Diapolo,2013-10-06T12:08:39Z,You were thinking of this?\n\n<pre>\nint nDoS = 0;\nif (state.IsInvalid(nDoS))\n    if (nDoS > 0)\n        pfrom->Misbehaving(nDoS);\n</pre>\n\nYeah would be easier to read...\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3047#issuecomment-25767071,25767071,
laanwj,2013-10-07T06:38:18Z,"@Diapolo Yes, I'd prefer something like that, as it gives more of a signal to the reader that nDOS is the result of the state.IsInvalid() call. Now they could think 'hey, it's never >0, let's cut that code out!', but never mind this is just bikeshedding...\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3047#issuecomment-25787604,25787604,
