jgarzik,2013-06-24T13:52:35Z,"@sipa Where is the discussion for the sleep change?  For a general facility, such as the one you are changing, it seems a valid use to directly begin execution.\n\nPutting the sleep first strikes me as a hack-y approach to a problem, that does not belong in a generic facility.  People in the Linux kernel routinely jigger sleep delays to paper over driver problems ;p\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2789#issuecomment-19907912,19907912,
