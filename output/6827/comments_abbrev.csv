jamesob,2015-10-14T18:30:43Z,Concept ACK\n\nEdit: though I do think it awkward to merge something that's going to have expected build failures... should we assess how difficult it'd be to implement the fixes and attach them to this PR?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6827#issuecomment-148146412,148146412,

jonasschnelli,2015-10-15T06:37:15Z,"utACK. But agree with @TheBlueMatt. The fee tolerance change might be controversial. Not sure anymore, but when i first implemented this, fees had a tiny variance because of signature sizes, etc.\n\nIt would be nice if we could fix the fee tolerance in a proper way, although, very precise fees are not the main objective to test during fundrawtransaction rpc tests.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6827#issuecomment-148295238,148295238,
MarcoFalke,2015-10-15T18:20:39Z,"@jonasschnelli I am not changing the behavior of fundrawtransaction. The fee tolerance was already there with `2 bytes * 1 sat/byte = 2 sat` and due to #6793 I changed it to `2 bytes * 5 sat/byte = 10 sat`. This should be uncontroversial and be enough to get the travis rpc tests back.

MarcoFalke,2015-10-15T06:39:04Z,@jonasschnelli  @TheBlueMatt Can you elaborate? I may be missing something but the rpc tests should not fail by changing the relayFee. Right now the bitcoin coin selection can only terminate if there is a tolerance of at least 2 bytes. (I.e. the transaction fee is paying for two bytes more than the tx actually has.) Consequently the `feeTolerance` is 2 bytes times whatever_you_pay_per_byte.\n\nReg,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6827#discussion_r42087867,42087867,qa/rpc-tests/fundrawtransaction.py
