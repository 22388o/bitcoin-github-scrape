sipa,2012-03-29T19:02:52Z,"With this patch I did my fastest full block chain load from a local file yet, and did so with never needing more than 120 MiB of log files. After #1007 (which does not appear slower), this still requires 220 MiB.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1010#issuecomment-4828486,4828486,

sipa,2012-03-29T23:48:20Z,"@jgarzik it was chosen after some benchmarks that counted the number of transactions between flushes. Flushing every 200000 transactions causes max 120 MiB log files, which seemed reasonable as long as it did not decrease block sync efficiency.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1010#issuecomment-4833837,4833837,
jgarzik,2012-03-30T01:22:39Z,"Just the simple time-based heuristic would seem to suffice for both initial block download and thereafter.  maintaining the 200k counter seems rather useless after I.B.D. completion.\n\nBut no big matter...  just a nit, not a NAK :)\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1010#issuecomment-4834845,4834845,
