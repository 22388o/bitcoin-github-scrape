laanwj,2014-06-04T06:22:33Z,"As I've said before many times, I'm not happy about statically linking qt on Linux - and certainly not everything it depends on like font libraries. This should be up to the system. This will mess up appmenu integration in Ubuntu, for example, and other distro-specific customization.\n\nUsing an executable linked against 4.6 headers with 4.8 is safe, as Qt is backwards compatible.

laanwj,2014-06-17T15:26:33Z,"I've changed my mind here. Seems Ubuntu 10.04 has an older version of Qt4 (4.6.2) than the one whose headers we link against (4.6.4), causing a runtime error about a missing symbol. \n\nInstead of dropping the version even further, we may as well link Qt5 statically. Better to have no Ubuntu menu integration than to be incompatible. At least if the executables produced by this work on 10.04...\n\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4284#issuecomment-46322567,46322567,
theuni,2014-06-17T20:44:50Z,"Ok. I'll summarize my discussion with @laanwj on this PR, since we had it on IRC.\n\nPros of static link:\n- No client Qt dependency\n- Not stuck with old Qt\n- No build tricks to make it work\n\nCons:\n- Hard dependency on libxcb and libfreetype\n- No Ubuntu app-menu integration\n\nFor the first con, I believe this is somewhat moot because these are nearly guaranteed to exist on a linux system, a",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4284#issuecomment-46362643,46362643,

Michagogo,2014-06-18T14:35:13Z,"""Also, note that the move of qt's build into the -deps descriptor was not arbitrary. We need the to provide Qt with our static libssl and that seemed like the most straightforward approach.""\n\n@theuni In my opinion, this isn't a good thing to do.

laanwj,2014-06-18T14:58:38Z,"I agree with @michagogo here.
