    "body": "As I've said before many times, I'm not happy about statically linking qt on Linux - and certainly not everything it depends on like font libraries. This should be up to the system. This will mess up appmenu integration in Ubuntu, for example, and other distro-specific customization.\n\nUsing an executable linked against 4.6 headers with 4.8 is safe, as Qt is backwards compatible. This has always been the case with the executables built on Ubuntu 10.04!\n\nBTW: if you show dependencies please show the _direct_ dependencies. The current bitcoin-qt only  has a few libraries it depends, on, none at all X or font libraries. I suppose it should even work with non-X qt (for example wayland).\n\n```\nobjdump -p bin/32/bitcoin-qt |grep NEEDED                                                                                        \n  NEEDED               librt.so.1\n  NEEDED               libQtGui.so.4\n  NEEDED               libQtNetwork.so.4\n  NEEDED               libQtCore.so.4\n  NEEDED               libpthread.so.0\n  NEEDED               libstdc++.so.6\n  NEEDED               libm.so.6\n  NEEDED               libgcc_s.so.1\n  NEEDED               libc.so.6\n```\n\nAs you see this is already a bare minimum.

Seems Ubuntu 10.04 has an older version of Qt4 (4.6.2) than the one whose headers we link against (4.6.4), causing a runtime error about a missing symbol. \n\nInstead of dropping the version even further, we may as well link Qt5 statically. Better to have no Ubuntu menu integration than to be incompatible. At least if the executables produced by this work on 10.04...\n\nEdit: needs rebase\n",

    "body": "Ok. I'll summarize my discussion with @laanwj on this PR, since we had it on IRC.\n\nPros of static link:\n- No client Qt dependency\n- Not stuck with old Qt\n- No build tricks to make it work\n\nCons:\n- Hard dependency on libxcb and libfreetype\n- No Ubuntu app-menu integration\n\nFor the first con, I believe this is somewhat moot because these are nearly guaranteed to exist on a linux system, and the qt libs almost certainly depend on them anyway.\n\nThe second con is what @laanwj addresses above: better to work at all than work without app-menu integration.\n\nAt the time, we discussed the fact that Ubuntu has upstreamed their app-menu changes, and that they're included in qt5.3. This pull can be trivially updated to use 5.3 rather than 5.2, but I'm unsure if the theme plugins will load when using a static build. I'm testing that right now.\n",

    "body": "Rebased.\n\nUnfortunately, the same plugin restrictions apply to themes as well with qt 5.3. Meaning that themes can't be loaded dynamically from a static binary.\n\nI spent a little while investigating the stability of the interfaces for appmenu-qt, and it seems that it would be no problem to link in statically, since there are only 2 functions in the external api, and the rest happens over dbus. Unfortunately though, it means that bitcoin-qt would gain a dependency on libgtk+ and libglib2, so that's a non-starter.\n\nSince there's no obvious benefit in moving to 5.3, I left it at 5.2.1. 5.3 can be dropped in later with no changes necessary, except that this workaround can be removed: https://github.com/theuni/bitcoin/commit/d124f1120d41344555b984d1dbc5840ac25c1073#diff-8fd2f50cc3bac9865790ada2825a3006R131\n\nAlso, note that the move of qt's build into the -deps descriptor was not arbitrary. We need the to provide Qt with our static libssl and that seemed like the most straightforward approach.\n",

It might have made sense to have the Qt build in with the deps when it's just the headers etc, but Qt is a huge package to build and it would be best to separate it out. What's wrong with the approach we use for Windows, where the deps are an input for Qt?\n",

I realize that's out of the scope of this PR and I really don't like doing that, but I added it here because it touches the same stuff as Linux. It's not useful yet, just groundwork (though I do have local hacks that make it fully work).\n\nThis needs to be tested for regressions before switching. There's an issue with the systray icon colors being inverted which I haven't yet poked at, but that's pretty minor.\n",
