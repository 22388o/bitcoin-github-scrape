skeees,2018-04-16T01:19:21Z,"FindMostWorkChain() isn't particularly expensive to call redundantly when you know you are on the tip (it amounts to two hashtable lookups)\nIf you don't mind calling it unnecessarily on your last pass through the loop you can substantially tighten the 3 if statements you have to implement this logic",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12138#discussion_r181606136,181606136,src/validation.cpp
skeees,2018-04-16T01:19:26Z,Is there always guaranteed to be progress? From reading this loop it seems like it could interrogate a potential alternate chain - find some invalidity and then roll back to the original tip,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12138#discussion_r181606143,181606143,src/validation.cpp
