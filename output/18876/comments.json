    "body": "Sure, that was clear from your mail @ariard. I'm referring to some of the responses to your mailing list post which make arguments for this specific PR to be NACKed. All this project (Bitcoin Core) can do is facilitate superior light client protocols (assuming they are not harmful to the full node ecosystem which I haven't been convinced they are). If the light client ecosystem doesn't take off or if node operators all choose to turn `peerscfilters=false` there isn't much Core can do or should do. That is down to the node operators. But I'm trying to keep the arguments specific to this particular PR here. Any brainstorming on how we can make the light client ecosystem successful should **definitely** not be done here and should be done on the mailing list. \r\n\r\nPersonally, I think Concept ACK, Concept NACKs are fine to post here with a short explanation. But if we can keep as much of the discussion on the mailing list as possible I think that is preferable.",

    "body": "Running a full node will always be the superior option for privacy (and trust minimization) versus using a light client (improved or otherwise). If your primary objective is privacy the incentive is still there to run a full node. BIP157 reduces the gap between full node privacy and light client privacy that is true (light client privacy is improving). But this only affects a cohort of people who are wavering on whether to run a full node or not and see the privacy improvements of light clients as a reason not to. I have no idea how to quantify this cohort of people but I would be shocked if it was significant. Hence \"destroys\" seems to me to be a superlative.\r\n\r\nOn the upside, if the light client ecosystem was to grow and prosper post BIP157 it would need an increased number of full nodes to serve them filters. If the number of full nodes didn't increase to serve this filter demand then the light client ecosystem will be stunted forcing the cohort discussed above to lean back towards running a full node.\r\n\r\nIf the metric is \"number of independent parties running and using a listening full node\" I think growth of one ecosystem (light clients) has a positive impact on the growth of another (full nodes). If the metric is the **ratio** of light clients to \"number of independent parties running and using a listening full node\" then I think you have a point. I was of the understanding that we are more interested in the former than the latter.\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "As of April 2019 the size of all the filters is 4GB. I'm imagining a smartphone having to download 4GB from a raspberry pi node just to start up its bitcoin wallet. So would SPV wallets actually use this technology? You can hardly call it \"lightweight\". Not to mention the wallet also has to download the blocks including false positives.\r\n\r\nAt 4GB it's not far off from needing less bandwidth to download the UTXO set.\r\n\r\nYes, Wasabi Wallet already uses filters like these, but the only reason they made it work is their wallet _only_ uses bech32 addresses, which are very rare on the blockchain. And if everyone used wallets that used those addresses then the filters would again become unusable large.\r\n\r\nObviously the filters are very useful for making wallets rescans faster (a fast machine does it in 10 hours right now), but filters being used by lightweight wallets seems like a pipe dream to me. Happy to be convinced otherwise.",

Otherwise, it will be hard to follow the review process in the noise. Also, GitHub will start hiding comments if there are too many, making it painful to even read the code review and previous review comments. This can lead to review comments being overlooked and be left unaddressed.",
