MarcoFalke,2016-07-08T10:51:53Z,">  What's the raw JSON differences? Is this a tiny API change?\n\nyes, it is two different functions to generate the string. Before it used `setFloat` and `oss << std::setprecision(16) << val;`. After, it uses our wrapper function.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8317#issuecomment-231331667,231331667,

Also note that `getreceivedbyaddress` (and all other calls) already use `ValueFromAmount`.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8317#issuecomment-231338172,231338172,
