MatthewLM,2014-01-20T14:06:38Z,`validateaddress` does not make it clear that this is the way you can obtain a public key for an address. I would prefer to have a separate command for obtaining the public key.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3441#issuecomment-32761619,32761619,
laanwj,2014-01-20T14:21:33Z,"Yes, there are plans to introduce a `getaddressinfo` command instead.\n`validateaddress` could then eventually return to its prior use, validating addresses without any dependency on the wallet.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3441#issuecomment-32762751,32762751,
