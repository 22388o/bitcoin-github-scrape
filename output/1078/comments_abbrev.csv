laanwj,2012-04-12T05:51:14Z,"It has to do with URLs but not ""URL stuff that scares Gavin"".\n\nAnd this fixes a crash bug reported on the forums? I guess it should go into 0.6.1 then...\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1078#issuecomment-5084927,5084927,
Diapolo,2012-04-12T06:21:25Z,"This fixes a glitch with a payment request and the amount set, the crash observed in the forum was with 0.6 RC2 I can't reproduce this, but think as most changes here are very tiny it should go into 0.6.1.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1078#issuecomment-5085154,5085154,
laanwj,2012-04-12T08:00:45Z,From what I understand he performs a DOS attack on the QR generation code.\nBy pasting more and more text into the label field he eventually runs out\nof memory or some other limit.\n\nMaybe we should enforce a sanity limit on the URL length (256?) and above\nthat show an empty image.\n\nI could be completely wrong.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1078#issuecomment-5086217,5086217,
Diapolo,2012-04-12T10:15:07Z,An URI limit of <= 255 would be a good idea.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1078#issuecomment-5088126,5088126,
Diapolo,2012-04-12T16:40:43Z,Added URI length limit and info message to prevent a DoS against the dialog window.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1078#issuecomment-5095211,5095211,
laanwj,2012-04-12T17:49:36Z,"Works well. However, the info message is wider than the QR dialog, can you enable wordWrap on lblQRCode in the designer? Alternatively, paste this into the .ui file under &lt;widget class=""QLabel"" name=""lblQRCode"">:\n\n```\n <property name=""wordWrap"">\n  <bool>true</bool>\n </property>\n```\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1078#issuecomment-5096622,5096622,
