I'll gladly submit the idea to the mailing list for consensus.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/506#issuecomment-2040172,2040172,

There's a discussion on the Bitcoin-Dev mailing list if you've got input to add: http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_name=CAOPxoMv7EGwgBNuvYpaD_4LtyxUUCvQ2Pe0DCZO4uHoAoMyfnA%40mail.gmail.com&forum_name=bitcoin-development\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/506#issuecomment-2041331,2041331,
