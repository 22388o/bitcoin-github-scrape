jonasschnelli,2017-06-05T07:19:16Z,"Followed @benma's advice (force push amend commit):\n* moved the `input.cpp` relevant constants to from `policy.h` to `input.h`\n* fixed indentation\n\nI kept the name `policy.*`. Renaming it to `standard.*` makes little sense as long as we have tx size in there as well. Can split later.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10517#issuecomment-306120910,306120910,

benma,2017-06-03T12:21:45Z,"I think it would be beneficial to complete the split, i.e.:\n\n- include `script/standard.h` instead\n- move `MAX_P2SH_SIGOPS`, `MAX_STANDARD_P2WSH_STACK_ITEMS`, `MAX_STANDARD_P2WSH_STACK_ITEM_SIZE` and `MAX_STANDARD_P2WSH_SCRIPT_SIZE` from `policy.h` to `inputs.h`.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10517#discussion_r119985664,119985664,src/policy/inputs.cpp
benma,2017-06-05T07:54:39Z,"This is a bit confusing to me.\n\nThe sources list doesn't contain all of policy/*.cpp (`fees.cpp` and `inputs.cpp` could be in there?), and the ones listed below are not used together anywhere (i.e. `feerate.cpp` is used in `libbitcoin_common` which doesn't need `policy.cpp`, and `libbitcoin_server` relies on `policy.cpp` but not `feerate.cpp`).\n\nWhy is this shared library needed, and why t",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10517#discussion_r120059492,120059492,src/Makefile.am

jonasschnelli,2017-06-05T08:01:45Z,"It's an in-between step and allows to grow the independent policy code/module. `libbitcoin_policy_a` does only contain the complete independent policy classes.
