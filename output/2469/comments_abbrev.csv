sipa,2013-04-06T16:23:17Z,Any reason for swapping these?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2469#discussion_r3684167,3684167,src/qt/clientmodel.h
Diapolo,2013-04-06T16:49:23Z,Another pull I have in the pipe has small updates for `ClientModel::getBlockSource()` and it's usage. I intended to refelect the used order in that function here in the enum. But you are right it does not belong into this pull ;).\n\nEdit: Removed from that pull!\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2469#discussion_r3684260,3684260,src/qt/clientmodel.h
