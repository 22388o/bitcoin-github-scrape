    "body": "Agree with removing the build-date (in another PR), an alternative solution would be to only show the build date in non release builds (`!CLIENT_VERSION_IS_RELEASE`).\n\nI think we should merge this PR and remove openssl from the logs and the GUI. IMO there is not much value in logging the openssl version regarding to PRNG, and, eventually we'll end up with a custom PRNG implementation (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5885) anyways.\n",
