    "body": "They're not consistent, though. If I call \"getaddednodeinfo true\", and there's a disconnected dns entry, it will resolve at that moment and return with a list of ip's. However, the connection thread re-resolves and attempts to connect up to 2 min later.\n\nSo when using a seednode here (the only plausible use-case I can imagine), the results won't match what the thread actually tries to connect to because the attempt could be minutes later. Odds are I'll find that it connected to an IP that wasn't in the previous list. So I'm not sure how the result is any more useful than dropping to a terminal and running dig.\n\nThinking more constructively: maybe the fix (which I think we might've discussed at one point) would be to have the pending connection attempts stored so that the rpc could grab them, rather than working in parallel.\n\nI'm still not convinced that this is broadly useful, though I suppose the burden's on me to prove otherwise.\n\n@TheBlueMatt Maybe it would be more helpful if you described your specific use-case?\n",
