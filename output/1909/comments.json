    "body": "I already acked this for 0.7.1 (assuming we want this out of the door soon), but it does need more thinking.\n\nIf you make the pointer global (i.s.o static) and explicitly initialize it in an InitLogging() (called directly at the beginning of AppInit2) function you avoid the destructor trouble, plus you don't make the safety of initialization dependent on who-calls-first. Then add an assert() to printf that the lock is allocated, just in case. Another plus is that you can use the same lock in `#ifdef WIN32 if(fPrintToDebugger)`, where the issue still exists.\n\nAfter all, printf _does_ have some prerequisite requirements: it needs the arguments to be parsed and DataDir to be set correctly, which is only guaranteed when entering AppInit2. What if someone accidentally adds a printf before this is done? (ie, in GUI initialization, after all a printf looks reaaallly harmless):\n- It logs to the wrong datadir (the default one). Not that big of an issue for a few log messages to end up in the wrong log. However,\n- It _caches_ this datadir in cachedPath, and will return it every time GetDataDir is called. Uh oh!\n\nAn explicit InitLogging() call would solve this, and trap all accidental calls to printf before everything is in order. \n\nTalking of GetDataDir, it has the same issue. Though we jump the shark as it will never enter the lock when the path is cached, which you expect by the time it reaches destructors :-) But I can see another subtle initialization race, I think.\n",

That's almost certainly the case, but if it is, why not make it obvious, and have an InitLogging() function, called in init?\n\nI'm nitpicking. ACK.\n",

This makes thiings more predictable and maintainable than armoring against all possible non-determinism (which is pretty much impossible, you will forget something).\n\nThen again, it's good to have a fix in for 0.7.1.
