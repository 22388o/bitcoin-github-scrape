theuni,2014-09-22T19:42:07Z,I'd much rather drop the boost namespace here.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4961#issuecomment-56429051,56429051,
Spacefish,2014-09-22T19:43:08Z,"Yes, this solution is not the best. However when ""using boost"" is not that nice either.. However if we remove using boost, we have to prefix everything else that is used out of boost.\nIMHO Boost shouldn´t redefine int64_t and uint64_t, there are some macros inside boost which detect glibc and so on via defines, but they don´t seem to work... at least not in boost 1.49 on debian wheezy for me.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4961#issuecomment-56429188,56429188,
theuni,2014-09-22T19:45:28Z,"Heh, agreed with @sipa.\n\n@Spacefish that's the right thing to do. If something's using boost, it should be made clear.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4961#issuecomment-56429515,56429515,

laanwj,2014-09-22T20:14:20Z,I agree with @sipa and @theuni on not using namespace boost (and prefixing the boost types/methods) being preferable to prefixing all uses of [u]int64.\n\nBut foremost... I wonder why we don't have this issue in the environments that we use? What is different here?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4961#issuecomment-56434988,56434988,
Spacefish,2014-09-22T22:45:06Z,"i don´t really know.. i guess there are some libs messed up on that machine, but as there is a bugreport with the same problem, i just fixed it in the code. Now it works for me. Wanted to share the patch, but i don´t have the time to remove all ""using namespace boost;"" and prefixing everything.. sry.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4961#issuecomment-56455121,56455121,
