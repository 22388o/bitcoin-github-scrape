jtimon,2016-02-26T02:29:10Z,Closing for now. Will be reopened if #7563 is merged. Review will still be valuable and traceable even if the PR gets replaced in the future (although I hope to just reopen it at some point after 12.1 is released).\n\nEDIT: Why close then? I had violated my self-imposed policy of no more than 5 open PRs to master at a time.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7564#issuecomment-189083688,189083688,
