I have replaced this sorted map with an `std::unordered_map`, then it's not possible any more to just find the previous address quickly within the same map. That's why I have added another map that contains the back links. So this change repla",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12048#discussion_r159608353,159608353,src/support/lockedpool.cpp
