n0feer,2021-06-27 06:46:24,Yeah I agree that it’s not a good name. I think it’s better to just call it boolean_value or i. Do you have any better idea @luke-jr?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22345#issuecomment-869111765,869111765,

n0feer,2021-06-27 16:07:32,"@luke-jr Good idea. I renamed it. Regarding the `active_type` variable, should I just change `bool` to `active_type` and consider it in the if statement (line 3213)?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22345#issuecomment-869187321,869187321,
luke-jr,2021-06-27 16:55:15,Not sure what you're asking. I was just suggesting renaming the `t` variable to `active_type`,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22345#issuecomment-869193748,869193748,
