ghost,2014-08-18T21:04:03Z,"Thanks for checking this out. I personally disagree. I think that anyone reading the code knows that there are 86400 seconds in a day, and that 600 seconds is 10 minutes.\n\nWould you rather see constants for 86400, like DAY, and 10MIN for 600? Or do you prefer 60 \* 60 \* 24?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4724#issuecomment-52554857,52554857,
jgarzik,2014-08-18T21:12:18Z,"You must think in the context of changes over time, and how a change looks in a diff, not just the constant in isolation.  Changing 24 to 20 hours is much more readable using\n\n```\n   - 24 * 60 * 60\n   + 20 * 60 * 60\n```\n\nthan\n\n```\n   - 86400\n   + 72000\n```\n\nThis notation is intentional.
