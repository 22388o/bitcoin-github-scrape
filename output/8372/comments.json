    "body": "Interesting observation!  Thanks for working on this -- I've wondered if we had this type of bug on a few occasions but was never able to pin it down.  And I do think you're on to something, as your PR has made clear at least one situation where I can see that we might end up with extra references to the same node: I believe it can be reproduced by eg using `-connect=<ip>` and `-connect=<hostname>` on the command line, where hostname resolves to the same ip address (I added a LogPrintf() to FinalizeNode and observed that it doesn't seem to get called after disconnecting, eg via setban).\n\nHave you worked out how this extra reference might occur in typical node usage (or better yet, are you able to reproduce this in testing)?  So far the only smoking gun I see is where we're connecting to a peer by address name rather than IP, as I described above, but I don't know if that would be something that would commonly affect a node.\n\nThe only other thing I can think of is if there might be a race condition that could cause this -- eg in OpenNetworkConnections, is it possible that we might call ConnectNode() at:\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/6e6ab2c3238264b34c0c83ebf703502f5ec72848/src/net.cpp#L1788,\nafter failing to find the ip address we're about to connect to in the call to FindNode at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/6e6ab2c3238264b34c0c83ebf703502f5ec72848/src/net.cpp#L1782, but somehow in between that peer has connected to us, and thus it's found when we call FindNode at line https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/6e6ab2c3238264b34c0c83ebf703502f5ec72848/src/net.cpp#L388?\n\nI don't know if this is possible or if there's something in place already to prevent that...  If it is, then perhaps in addition to cleaning up the reference counting, we should also be re-thinking locking here.\n\nAlso ping @cfields in case this code is already set for demolition as part of the net refactor.\n",

    "body": "@sdaftuar I believe #8085 contains some of those locking fixes, though more are needed. I'll be rebasing that and begging for review after #8128 goes in. As a follow-up (or maybe it's in that branch?) CNodes move to shared_ptrs (which never leave CConnman iirc), so that we don't have to worry about manual refcounting.\n\nNot opposed to fixing this up as-is, but yes, this logic is set for removal.\n",
