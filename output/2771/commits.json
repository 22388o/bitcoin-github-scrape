Many distributions default to having a SOCKS proxy listening on port 9050, but others may not. In particular, the Tor Browser Bundle defaults to listening on a random port. See [Tor Project FAQ:TBBSocksPort](https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#TBBSocksPort) for how to properly\n+configure Tor.\n+\n+\n+1. Run bitcoin behind a Tor proxy\n+---------------------------------\n+\n+The first step is running Bitcoin behind a Tor proxy. This will already make all\n+outgoing connections be anonimized, but more is possible.\n+\n+\t-socks=5        SOCKS5 supports connecting-to-hostname, which can be used instead\n+\t                of doing a (leaking) local DNS lookup. SOCKS5 is the default,\n+\t                but SOCKS4 does not support this. (SOCKS4a does, but isn't\n+\t                implemented).\n+\t\n+\t-proxy=ip:port  Set the proxy server. If SOCKS5 is selected (default), this proxy\n+\t                server will be used to try to reach .onion addresses as well.\n+\t\n+\t-tor=ip:port    Set the proxy server to use for tor hidden services. You do not\n+\t                need to set this if it's the same as -proxy. You can use -notor\n+\t                to explicitly disable access to hidden service.\n+\t\n+\t-listen         When using -proxy, listening is disabled by default. If you want\n+\t                to run a hidden service (see next section), you'll need to enable\n+\t                it explicitly.\n+\t\n+\t-connect=X      When behind a Tor proxy, you can specify .onion addresses instead\n+\t-addnode=X      of IP addresses or hostnames in these parameters. It requires\n+\t-seednode=X     SOCKS5. In Tor mode, such addresses can also be exchanged with\n+\t                other P2P nodes.\n+\n+In a typical situation, this suffices to run behind a Tor proxy:\n+\n+\t./bitcoin -proxy=127.0.0.1:9050\n+\n+\n+2. Run a bitcoin hidden server\n+------------------------------\n+\n+If you configure your Tor system accordingly, it is possible to make your node also\n+reachable from the Tor network. Add these lines to your /etc/tor/torrc (or equivalent\n+config file):\n+\n+\tHiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/bitcoin-service/\n+\tHiddenServicePort 8333 127.0.0.1:8333\n+\n+The directory can be different of course, but (both) port numbers should be equal to\n+your bitcoind's P2P listen port (8333 by default).\n+\n+\t-externalip=X   You can tell bitcoin about its publicly reachable address using\n+\t                this option, and this can be a .onion address. Given the above\n+\t                configuration, you can find your onion address in\n+\t                /var/lib/tor/bitcoin-service/hostname. Onion addresses are given\n+\t                preference for your node to advertize itself with, for connections\n+\t                coming from unroutable addresses (such as 127.0.0.1, where the\n+\t                Tor proxy typically runs).\n+\t\n+\t-listen         You'll need to enable listening for incoming connections, as this\n+\t                is off by default behind a proxy.\n+\t\n+\t-discover       When -externalip is specified, no attempt is made to discover local\n+\t                IPv4 or IPv6 addresses. If you want to run a dual stack, reachable\n+\t                from both Tor and IPv4 (or IPv6), you'll need to either pass your\n+\t                other addresses using -externalip, or explicitly enable -discover.\n+\t                Note that both addresses of a dual-stack system may be easily\n+\t                linkable using traffic analysis.\n+\n+In a typical situation, where you're only reachable via Tor, this should suffice:\n+\n+\t./bitcoind -proxy=127.0.0.1:9050 -externalip=57qr3yd1nyntf5k.onion -listen\n+\n+(obviously, replace the Onion address with your own). If you don't care too much\n+about hiding your node, and want to be reachable on IPv4 as well, additionally\n+specify:\n+\n+\t./bitcoind ... -discover\n+\n+and open port 8333 on your firewall (or use -upnp).\n+\n+If you only want to use Tor to reach onion addresses, but not use it as a proxy\n+for normal IPv4/IPv6 communication, use:\n+\n+\t./bitcoin -tor=127.0.0.1:9050 -externalip=57qr3yd1nyntf5k.onion -discover\n+"
