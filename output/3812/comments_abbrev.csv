laanwj,2014-03-07T07:06:30Z,"I usually recommend against core changes just to make it easier for the GUI. In this case, the logic ""is a test net?"" is only used in the outer function to determine whether to tint the client green or not.\nNACK on moving it to ChainParams.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3812#issuecomment-36972897,36972897,
jtimon,2014-03-07T07:31:52Z,"Thanks for the feedback. Thinking more about it, doesn't really make much sense.\nAnother related idea would be to move TestNet() and RegTest() to be methods of CChainParams.\n\nTestNet() may seem more convenient than Params().testNet() or Params().isTestNet() but makes the code less readable. Actually my preference would be params.isTestNet(), using a simple instance instead of a const global-ish",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3812#issuecomment-36973967,36973967,

jtimon,2014-03-07T08:14:23Z,"Ok, that makes sense. So, yes, the proposed change is not a big move in that direction.\nI'm also noticing that there's no consisntency in the use of ""Params().NetworkID() == CChainParams::TESTNET"" vs ""TestNet()"".\nI now have a clearer idea of the changes I can do to like this more.
