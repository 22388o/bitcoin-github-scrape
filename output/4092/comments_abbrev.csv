christophebiocca,2014-04-25T14:41:04Z,"I had some comments on your original pull, but I think they got lost when you refreshed it. I'll leave them here:\n- Splitting a string on `;http` seems really ugly. Can you use `|` as a separator (it's never valid in a url), or even better make the string a list?\n- your logic to title case the domain name is going to look weird for live.insight.is. I'd just leave it verbatim.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4092#issuecomment-41399867,41399867,
