rebroad,2016-08-25T15:09:43Z,"@sipa Apologies.. I didn't expect anyone would look at it until Travis had given it the all clear - is there a preferred way to get Travis to look at my code before any of the Core developers, such as yourself, do?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8591#issuecomment-242422648,242422648,
sipa,2016-08-25T15:14:11Z,It's fine to submit a pull request you're confident about to get all the\ntesting Travis does. But please try compiling things yourself first before\nwasting other's time.\n\nIn this case you're clearly missing a file. It would also be nice to credit\nthe original author of the code...\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8591#issuecomment-242424142,242424142,

rebroad,2016-08-25T15:44:47Z,"@sipa The author is already clearly credited - Gavin's photo appears next to the commit, and it would be Gavin's name, as far as I know that would appear in the commit log - although I'm not sure this is ideal given that I made some edits to it - anyway, I was mostly testing, and perhaps @jl2012 is correct when saying I was abusing Travis! I'm not aware of a Travis policy, so if there is one, plea",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8591#issuecomment-242435556,242435556,
