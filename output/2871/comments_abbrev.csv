gavinandresen,2013-08-02T14:34:27Z,"mapOrphanTransactions[hash] cannot be null; it will be initialized to an empty (default constructor) CTransaction when referenced. That should be impossible, because addOrphan/EraseOrphan keeps mapOrphanTransactions and mapOrphanTransactionsByPrev in sync. But even if some bug caused it to happen, if that default CTransaction made it out of the orphan list it would be rejected by the memory pool.
