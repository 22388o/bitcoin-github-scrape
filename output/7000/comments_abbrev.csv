jonasschnelli,2015-11-12T12:39:30Z,"@paveljanik the problem with a parameter for `showDebugWindow()` is, that binding a parameter to a signal is non-trivial (requires a `QSignalMapper`) and result in a uncommon code. I have considered that but was going for the more clear way which not really involves more code line (maybe +2).\n\nI have testes it on OSX. QT automaps the `OSX-cmd` key to `ctrl`. Needs testing on Linux/Windows.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7000#issuecomment-156093632,156093632,

jonasschnelli,2015-11-12T12:29:14Z,Right. It looks a bit strange. But i think it should compile fine and leaves no men-leak (and requires less code).\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7000#discussion_r44651318,44651318,src/qt/bitcoingui.cpp
