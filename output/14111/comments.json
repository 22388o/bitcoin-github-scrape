    "body": "@ryanofsky Thanks for taking a look.\r\n\r\nThe bug definitely still exists, so one way or another the call to `Stop` must be removed in the destructor of `BaseIndex`. This manifests for me in #14121.\r\n\r\nThe idea here is to have an RAII wrapper in the places where the control flow is not managed through globals. Concretely, the only place we see some benefit is in the unit tests, [where the explicit `Stop` call can be removed](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14111/files#diff-48c52d305c8b9bbeb803643f0ebed2b5L73). The global map is just there because in bitcoind, the index lifecycle is manages through global functions.\r\n\r\nThe much simpler alternative here is to just require that `Stop` be called before the index goes out of scope as part of its contract, which is pretty much as it is now (except that the `Stop` in the destructor can be removed). Conceptually, the RAII wrapper seems cleaner and makes it easier to handle exceptions in general, though it doesn't seem to provide much value given how indexes are actually managed by bitcoind now.",
