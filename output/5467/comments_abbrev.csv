jonasschnelli,2015-01-29T08:44:53Z,This method is unused. Is there a plan to make use of it soon? IMO we should keep unused implementation in master at minimum.

laanwj,2015-01-30T10:26:36Z,"NACK on changing this. There is check for certs.empty() that prevents this from becoming a bug, but for loops that count down, I generally prefer to use signed types. In this case, `i` will never visit 0, but normally a loop like this would look like:\n\n```\nfor (int i = certs.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {\n```\n\nIf you then change the int to e.g. size_t, it will loop forever.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5467#discussion_r23834006,23834006,src/qt/paymentrequestplus.cpp
