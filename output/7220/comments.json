So you could increase by 1 satoshi to get minRelayFee+minRelayFee usually.\n\nIf you factored in that it replaced 20 TXs, suddenly you're doing minRelayFee*20+minRelayFee and paying the proper fee.\n\nEdit: Some typos.

I already said this doesn't work in It's current state and it could only work if it can/will factor in the minimum fees for all transactions replaced in the chain (making it literally impossible to pay any less than the sum of all minimum fees) I guess that's impossible if they're completely dropped from mempool.\n\nI still agree with the concept so I'm hesitant to NACK this. If considering all minfees for all previously replaced TXs is impossible then NACK but I don't think it is. The node could even keep some information about the dropped TXs (size, and anything relevant for future fee calcs maybe) lingering for such calculations until the final TX is mined, it'd be fast, and wouldn't allow anyone to pay under the minimum fee. Is that outside of the scope of this PR though? \n",

I was trying to convey the issue is the PR as is didn't account for all the minimum fees of past transactions. Is that correct, or no?\n- <@GIJensen&gt; You mentioned a cache, so that made me believe I'm correct. I just want to know to be sure I properly understand what's happening.\n- <@Luke-Jr&gt; yes, if A is replaced by B, and C might replace B, we need C to pay for A+B+C, but we no longer have A\n- <@GIJensen&gt; Thank you!\n- <@Luke-Jr&gt; so to fix this, we would need to store the size of A (and anything it replaced) with B\n- <@Luke-Jr&gt; nTotalRelaySize or smth\n- <@GIJensen&gt; Okay, yes I understand completely. Do you still plan on trying to work on the concept? Or just axe it for now?\n- <@Luke-Jr&gt; I think the benefits do not outweigh the costs now\n- <@GIJensen&gt; I was worried about that, okay\n",
