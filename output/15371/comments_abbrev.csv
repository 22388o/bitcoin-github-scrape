It seems something that should happen at another level before passing it to this function.

fanquake,2019-02-11T14:23:01Z,"Regardless of how it's done, is the end goal here to also have the address inside the QR code uppercase? \nAs it's currently implemented (3407b44), we only get an uppercase address in the URI, and not for the other two addresses displayed in the QR code dialog. i.e:\n\n![qr code](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/863730/52569002-2fbf4580-2e4b-11e9-9bfd-2da4d0d1d0d2.png)\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15371#issuecomment-462344608,462344608,
benthecarman,2019-02-11T19:12:13Z,I feel like the current implementation makes the most sense.  It would be confusing to have addresses shown primarily in lowercase but when generating a URI it will be shown in uppercase.  Here it just has the address in the URI in uppercase for the optimization and the user never knows that the optimization occurred. ,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15371#issuecomment-462455255,462455255,

Sjors,2019-02-19T13:15:06Z,"Concept ACK. I don't mind too much what the URI looks like, but it doesn't need the same optimization as the QR code, so my light preference is to keep that lower case.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15371#issuecomment-465123548,465123548,
