laanwj,2015-02-09T11:40:44Z,"@jonasschnelli is working on larger changes to the wallet, and adding a 'netwallet' based on a new database. There doesn't seem to be much point in improving the performance of the legacy wallet, with risk of breaking things. So I'm closing this, sorry.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4702#issuecomment-73495542,73495542,
ghost,2015-10-26T12:27:20Z,Any news on this wallet by @jonasschnelli ? I ask because a number of useful ideas seem to have been by-passed in favor of this option.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4702#issuecomment-151117117,151117117,
jonasschnelli,2015-10-26T12:32:29Z,Still working on the wallet. Currently I'm exploring some hardware wallet stuff. Soon I'm back refactoring the wallet. Very likely I'm going to remove everything node related from my core-wallet fork and support SPV*RPC (qt) wallet connection to a trusted full node. Bundling the two (for deployment) could still be possible.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4702#issuecomment-151119514,151119514,

ghost,2015-10-26T12:54:30Z,"hehehe, it'll be a year soon and likely any work you do will take a while longer. Why don't we re-consider the most useful pull requests and maybe merge them? Then later when your version becomes available, we can allow users to have a choice? I see no downside to this and would be willing to put in some hours towards these goals. \n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4702#issuecomment-151123945,151123945,
