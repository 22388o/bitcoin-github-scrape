For git the file size is going to effectively double, since it has to keep track of both versions.\n\nIf the savings are worthwhile, I'd suggest to adjust our script to use zopfli: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/contrib/devtools/optimize-pngs.py",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18661#issuecomment-614309877,614309877,
