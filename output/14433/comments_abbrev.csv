TheCharlatan,2018-10-09T11:03:02Z,I think it does not terminate if you use check_call  instead. ,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14433#discussion_r223654545,223654545,contrib/gitian-build.py
laanwj,2019-01-09T16:06:46Z,I'm not sure I understand why `check_call` wouldn't work here (or would hang). This is ignoring the result so the `check_output` call does the same as `check_call` except for swallowing stdout. In the case of `check_call` the output would go to the caller process' stdout.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14433#discussion_r246440928,246440928,contrib/gitian-build.py
