laanwj,2017-08-23T10:05:43Z,I guess there's some reason `vchRet.end() - 4` doesn't work (pointer versus iterator conflict or something like that)?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10961#discussion_r134709635,134709635,src/base58.cpp
meshcollider,2017-08-23T20:20:28Z,"Yeah `vchRet.end()-4` would still be an iterator I believe, so you'd have to do some ugly thing like `&*(vchRet.end()-4)` to make it into a pointer iirc?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10961#discussion_r134859783,134859783,src/base58.cpp
sipa,2017-08-23T22:59:15Z,How about `&vchRet[vchRet.size() - 4]` ?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10961#discussion_r134891847,134891847,src/base58.cpp
