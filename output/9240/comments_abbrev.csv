sipa,2016-11-30T20:15:08Z,"@TheBlueMatt Comments on how this should interact with #9014? Perhaps we want to keep the ConnectTrace struct there, but with just blocksConnected in it, or remove the struct entirely?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9240#issuecomment-263982567,263982567,
TheBlueMatt,2016-12-01T01:59:04Z,"I'd prefer to keep the ConnectTrace in #9014 as it might make fixing #9027 easier later. One will have to be rebased on the other, though...",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9240#issuecomment-264056353,264056353,

One response might be to revert #9240, another response might be to add new calls to SyncTr",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9240#issuecomment-267149570,267149570,
sipa,2016-12-01T00:17:37Z,This changes the `fCurrentEstimate` parameter value from false to true. Intentional?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9240#discussion_r90359235,90359235,src/test/mempool_tests.cpp
