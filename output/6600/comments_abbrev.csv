Seems like a distro decision to me, but consistency over where to find what binary seems a good idea, however it's achieved.\n\nThis does highlight the slightly silly situation of Debian's debianisation living with them (neither clearly following gi",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6600#issuecomment-136061912,136061912,
