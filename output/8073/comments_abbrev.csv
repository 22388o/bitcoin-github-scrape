jonasschnelli,2016-05-19T18:37:40Z,Looks good. Thanks.\nutACK 02ce2a3ca773e2d10ff37ecf50d15c71113f3335\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8073#issuecomment-220414554,220414554,
Tyler-Hardin,2016-05-19T20:45:34Z,I kinda doubt the secure clear is useful. Wouldn't the QString that already contains the password be untouched and just deallocated?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8073#issuecomment-220446890,220446890,
Tyler-Hardin,2016-05-19T20:55:55Z,"Actually, QLineEdit::text isn't a const reference (most Qt properties are not writable), so you can zero the memory yourself. I would recommend directly zeroing the existing QString if you really want attempt to clear it securely.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8073#issuecomment-220449529,220449529,
jonasschnelli,2016-05-20T04:02:51Z,Cleansing the memory can help. But I think there are various cases where the UI framework leaves uncleaned copies somewhere in the ram.\nI think the main use advantage of this PR is: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8073/files#diff-defede4762fd62a298bd8a0936cd3ed0R103 (the clear in AskPassphraseDialog::accept()).\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8073#issuecomment-220512303,220512303,
