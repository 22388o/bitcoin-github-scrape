There are at least three recovery techniques we can use:\r\n- attempt to salvage non-aggressively\r\n- attempt to salvage aggressively\r\n- do a memory scan for DER encoded private keys in the .dat file.\r\n\r\nThose operations should be done by a separate tool and not loaded immediately into bitcoind, since the output could be worse than simply reading the .dat file, and can lead to loss of keys. I'll put this on hold until we have #8745 merged.",
