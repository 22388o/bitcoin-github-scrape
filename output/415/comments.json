Its a cool feature for those who wish to make their bitcoin usage anonymous, but by itself it does not even get close to providing anonymity.  It also pushes the wrong message about bitcoin: it was designed to be, and is anonymous; and that it is great for use in illegal activity.  That message should be highly avoided as it is highly detrimental to the adoption of bitcoin.  This as a separate branch is cool, but it should not be in the mainline IMO.  Additionally, does this work as expected if you are using a OP_EVAL address or a compressed pubkey address?\n",

It will remain an advanced feature, manually setting inputs/outputs is not for the faint-hearted.\n\nHowever, it is a valid use-case. And if people want to do advanced things with addresses and address linkages, and someone is contributing code for it, why not incorporate it?\n\nAlso look at this thread. The guy first submitted this pull request, people were positive about it, then it lingered, he ported it Qt even. And now suddenly we should reject it in the mainline, not because of code quality concerns but because we're afraid the project gets a bad name? \n\nIMO this is wrong. Either a feature needs to be rejected immediately or it should be put on the roadmap to be merged for some version.\n",

Further more (prior to this pull), one needs to have multiple wallets to have any separation of 'accounts' which is more error prone and confusing.

Bitcoin took a huge beating at 28c3, and this would allow the biggest pseudo-complaint to be addressed. Therefore this patch has become special. Either way, I intended to put down support for this: this is my +1, minus the lack of \"why.\" coderrr your work is VERY much appreciated, even if it doesn't soon make it into core.\n\nIf I don't like patch process, fork huh.. hrm.. I guess the same could be said to Charles Hannum. Yea fair enough, point taken, and reciprocated: if you don't like my comments, don't answer them. That's what everyone else does lol.\n",

In the coin control tab I'm seeing all the new addresses separated from each other and the change by blank lines, suggesting there's no way of tying the together, but they're all outputs of the same transaction.  Is that a bug?  I would expect all the new outputs as well as the change to be lumped in with the big group that the input was part of before this transaction.\n",

    "body": "I also found a different bug.  If you leave the \"Send From\" box empty in the \"Send coins\" tab and try to send coins, CWallet::setSendFromAddressRestriction(string addresses) is called with an empty string, boost:split makes a set of restrictions cointaining one element, the empty string, and then the this->sendFromAddressRestriction.empty() check in CWallet::SelectCoinsMinConf is false, and so no coins are acceptable as input.\n\nSomething like this will fix it:\n\n```\n-  boost::split(sendFromAddressRestriction, addresses, boost::is_any_of(\";,\"));\n+  if (addresses.empty())\n+     this->sendFromAddressRestriction.clear();\n+  else\n+     boost::split(sendFromAddressRestriction, addresses, boost::is_any_of(\";,\"));\n```\n\nThe fact that such a bug exists suggests that this patch hasn't really been tested enough.\n",

The change issue is a little more complicated.\n\n\"I sent a payment to myself from a single large output to lots of small new previously unused addresses\"\n\nSomeone looking at the chain wouldn't be able to prove that the output addresses are controlled by the same person so it doesn't show them as linked.  It only links input addresses (since the same person obviously controls them) as well as the change (which can usually be identified).  So in general it tries to link things that someone else would be able to link, not what you would be able to link.  If we changed the logic to be what you would be able to link, why not just link your whole wallet right off the bat?  That said, the change linkage disappearing after you send to it is a legit problem.\n",

    "body": "I rewrote the code that makes the unique groupings so it runs a lot faster.  Now it takes about half a second on my wallet instead of 7 seconds and makes the code simpler to read too.  It's odd - after changing the return type of ExpandGroupings to be void, the time it took dropped from 72 to 2.5 seconds, but then the next day it went back up to 7 seconds.  I made a few new big transactions, but I was surprised it added such a delay.\n\nI committed my change here:\n\nhttps://github.com/dooglus/bitcoin/commit/87168d9a8ecd270306f7d1deb7a14f2d773d2fec\n\nI'm not sure what to do with the IsDisjoint() function - it's only used in wallet.cpp, and isn't really anything to do with wallets, so I made it a file local (static) function, then didn't need to declare it in the header.\n",

True if the two input sets are disjoint (have no members in common).\nSets are sorted, so you can iterate through them in order rather than having to compare every member of the first with every member of the second.\n\nBut first give me a chance to rewrite the GetAddressGroupings function to no longer need IsDisjoint().\n",

First, I figured the less code I changed the less argument I'd get from devs about it.  Secondly, it'd be easier to continually re-merge as master changed.\n\nIf you guys believe this feature should be merged into mainline then I'll gladly rewrite it in a \"cleaner\" way.  But I'd rather not do that until it's been agreed the core devs think this belongs.\n",

    "body": "@coderr  It is also a bit my fault, I've never really explained the design of Bitcoin-Qt. My idea is that the UI bits (dialogs, widgets, screens) are independent of a specific bitcoin implementation. The UI bits communicate with the models through method calls and Qt signals. The models communicate with the core in whatever way they need to; that includes changing globals if you really need to, though I'd personally prefer it as parameter to minimize the factor of surprise.\n\nThanks\n",

    "body": "I agree with @luke-jr in principle. In JSON-RPC, arrays are a first-class object. Even though this is easy for CLI usage, there is really no need to concatenate things into strings and parse it out later. Using multiple kinds of parsing/concatenation imposes extra work on the caller (and other implementations of the RPC protocol).\n\nIMO the optional \"overloading\" using an array instead of a string as destination address is the best way, but if you notice it doesn't fit the \"sendtoaddress\" paradigm at all anymore, make it a new call.\n",
