ryanofsky,2018-10-10T03:08:54Z,"This paragraph doesn't really make sense when both behaviors are present in the same release. I'd maybe change it to:\n\n> When bitcoin is configured with the `-deprecatedrpc=accounts` setting,\n> specifying a `label`/`account`/`dummy` argument will return both outgoing and\n> incoming transactions.
