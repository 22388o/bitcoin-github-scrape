sipa,2014-12-18T12:56:56Z,"Verified b7155a9e96ced01651888cda89aee1a68d696852's code in aith_uint256.{h,cpp} to be a pure copy of the original code in uint256.{h,cpp}, apart from some type name changes, and _IMPORTANT_ 2 deleted trailing white spaces in the comments above SetCompact.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5490#issuecomment-67482107,67482107,
sipa,2014-12-18T13:24:51Z,"Untested ACK, but the code (both blob and arithmetic versions of it) looks well tested.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5490#issuecomment-67484898,67484898,
laanwj,2014-12-19T12:19:39Z,"I've added a commit that (and left the rest untouched)\n- Removes direct `arith_uint256` initialization from byte vector. It is only used in the tests, so I've provided an alternative function there that just goes through `uint256`.\n- Implements GetHex and SetHex in terms of `uint256`. As these functions work bytewise and expect little-endian they belong there (also removes a bit of duplication).",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5490#issuecomment-67631711,67631711,
