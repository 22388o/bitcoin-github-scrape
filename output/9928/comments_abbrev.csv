The only point here is to stop travis from failing ASAP. Checking just the top commit is a workaround until the script can be fixed properly. \n\nIf you want to properly fix the script in one go, that's great, but please do it soon because the failling Travis is an annoyance a",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9928#issuecomment-284441593,284441593,
MarcoFalke,2017-03-06T16:10:33Z,"@laanwj, travis specifically fails because bbd7579 and 589cd63 are not\nyet merged into master, not due to excessive recursion.
