laanwj,2017-04-10T07:01:43Z,Thanks for testing. Then I'm going to merge this to prevent test failures for affected devs; the build system integration can be improved later.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10142#issuecomment-292865930,292865930,
theuni,2017-04-06T17:45:34Z,"Can this be done automatically based on the platform selected? Or does it require manual placement of the .show()s?

ryanofsky,2017-04-06T19:07:35Z,"> We need to make it so that this doesn't signal failed qt detection if libqminimal isn't found.\n\nWhat should happen if minimal isn't found, and why we can't just make it a requirement? I looked into trying making it make it optional, but it seemed like a mess, see my comment https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10117#issuecomment-291175634",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10142#discussion_r110243271,110243271,build-aux/m4/bitcoin_qt.m4
ryanofsky,2017-04-06T19:13:56Z,">Can this be done automatically\n\nIt would probably be possible to test code that would show all widgets. So far I've found it useful just to show selected widgets when debugging.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10142#discussion_r110244498,110244498,src/qt/test/wallettests.cpp
laanwj,2017-04-07T15:11:33Z,As I understand it the issues troubleshooted here are rare enough that it's fine to have the developer insert his own .show()s at appropriate places. It's just useful to have this comment in that case.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10142#discussion_r110412997,110412997,src/qt/test/wallettests.cpp
