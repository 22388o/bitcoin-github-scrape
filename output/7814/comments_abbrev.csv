MarcoFalke,2016-05-04T08:37:21Z,"I've been testing this on fedora linux. Would be good to know if this also works on osx and win. (If you want to test this, there is no need to compile anything. Just fetch the commit and run it through the test suite.)\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7814#issuecomment-216787227,216787227,
