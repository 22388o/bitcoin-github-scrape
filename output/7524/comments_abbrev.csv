morcos,2016-02-12T20:45:02Z,My [comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6564#issuecomment-178636856) remains that I would prefer VerifyLockTime not be encapsulated for reuse for nLockTime and nSequence checks. \n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7524#issuecomment-183482406,183482406,
btcdrak,2016-02-13T06:39:14Z,@morcos @petertodd I agree the encapsulation hampers readability. I propose something like 2fcd56f.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7524#issuecomment-183611554,183611554,

btcdrak,2016-02-14T19:43:14Z,I've squashed to two commits. 53e53a3 corresponds to the state of #6564 as per OP and c3c3752 (was 2fcd56f) addresses request from @morcos and @petertodd.\n\nPrevious branch state for verification [`checksequenceverify_2fcd56f`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/compare/master...btcdrak:checksequenceverify_2fcd56f).\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7524#issuecomment-183963491,183963491,

laanwj,2016-02-16T09:09:57Z,"This `return false` here seems to come out of the blue, which could make people misread the code and introduce bugs. I'd suggest adding the `))` to the line before it, or surrounding with `{}`.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7524#discussion_r52983907,52983907,src/script/interpreter.cpp
