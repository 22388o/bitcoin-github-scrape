cjavad,2017-12-11T13:00:23Z,Yes but most unix based operating systems uses the bin/python symlink that is included with fx. macos and linux. And because the ```#!bin/env python``` is targeted for unix users and other POSIX based OSs where some of them dont have the ```#!bin/env python2``` symlink like MacOS. So i would argue that using  ```#!bin/env python``` is preferred over ```#!bin/env python2```.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11843#issuecomment-350717655,350717655,
