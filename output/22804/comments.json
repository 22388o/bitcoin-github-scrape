It resides in `ChainstateManager::PopulateAndValidateSnapshot`, which is in turn called by `ChainstateManager::ActivateSnapshot`, which is not called anywhere (besides of fuzzing and unit tests).\r\nThe value 1 for `nChainTx` simply results from the coinbase transaction of the genesis block that is embedded in the code (and hence already available before IBD starts). So in that sense one could argue that the calculation is actually not entirely wrong; the verification value is (hopefully) only used for statistical purposes anyways and if the progress value before IBD is zero or almost-zero doesn't matter that much.\r\n\r\nSo with that in mind, I'm updating Concept ACK ~0 (neutral) on this, would love to hear others opinion on this.",
