jonasschnelli,2016-09-14T13:36:43Z,utACK but looks like your are using functions not available in the libevent version travis compiles against (evhttp_request_error) https://travis-ci.org/bitcoin/bitcoin/jobs/159869918#L1081\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8722#issuecomment-247014800,247014800,

laanwj,2016-09-14T16:26:46Z,I've guarded the uses of evhttp error with `LIBEVENT_VERSION_NUMBER >= 0x02010300`. This is the version it was introduced in according to git history. On older versions it will always print unknown error.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8722#issuecomment-247071292,247071292,
laanwj,2016-09-21T12:17:04Z,Ok I've slightly tweaked the error messages and rebased. This should be ready to go.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8722#issuecomment-248594044,248594044,
