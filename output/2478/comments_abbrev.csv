gmaxwell,2013-04-07T03:50:34Z,"Partial has searching requires a more expensive index than exact matching and isn't needed for any of the network protocol or basic functionality of the software. Though what we use today can support it, getting stuck with it would be unfortunate when it only saves us some space in logs.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2478#issuecomment-16008956,16008956,
