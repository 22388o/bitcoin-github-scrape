promag,2018-10-24T10:47:14Z,@MarcoFalke before #11634 the lock wasn't held when calling `uiInterface.LoadWallet(walletInstance)`. My suggestion was to revert that ~~behaviour~~ change.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14560#issuecomment-432607822,432607822,
MarcoFalke,2018-10-24T11:16:55Z,"Yeah, I don't see the change in behaviour. Is there any?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14560#issuecomment-432615590,432615590,

MarcoFalke,2018-10-24T11:40:50Z,Ah ok. Slightly tend to NACK due to our refactoring guidelines.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14560#issuecomment-432621798,432621798,
practicalswift,2018-10-24T12:03:05Z,@MarcoFalke Makes sense! Closing :-),https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14560#issuecomment-432627638,432627638,
promag,2018-10-24T12:11:39Z,"I don't get it why this is refactoring, this should just revert something that was changed for no good reason. Anyway it was just a comment. ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14560#issuecomment-432630030,432630030,
