Diapolo,2012-05-03T05:24:50Z,"Perhaps that is a dumb question, but is that the minimum IE version that has to be installed on the client running the BC client or is it needed for the machine, which compiles the executable?\n\nI'm asking, because I'm sure MS doesn't support IE 5.1 anymore and we should perhaps do the same then?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1187#issuecomment-5481194,5481194,
laanwj,2012-05-03T05:45:24Z,"ACK\n\n@diapolo Right, we don't actually use IE, but if you define _WIN32_IE to some old version you may be including some deprecated API that no longer exists on 64 bit windows.\n\nEdit: which makes me wonder, what happens if you don't define _WIN32_IE at all? or do all windows programs need it?  If so, why don't we define these things (_WIN32_WINNT, _WIN32_IE) centrally in the build system inste",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1187#issuecomment-5481354,5481354,
Diapolo,2012-05-03T07:28:06Z,I will try to compile without and see what happens ... seems like it compiles with _WIN32_IE only and _WIN32_WINNT removed. Afaik it tells the compiler which WinAPI functions are available with the specified IE / WINNT version.\n\nIn util.cpp it is needed for SHGetSpecialFolderPathA() function.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1187#issuecomment-5482343,5482343,
