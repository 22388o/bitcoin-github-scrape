This is broken in the official 1.47 and 1.49, too.\n\nI suggest we combine your work here and my work (with ipcRecover()), as there still could be a chance to have an orphan message queue file, but only during the current Windows session.\n\nYour fix ensures that after a restart a new folder with current bootup-time will be created and mine covers stale message queue files. Seems like a pretty decent combination :).\n",

If boost's interprocess stuff were to die with bitcoin (not sure how boost handles it, did I read that it was thrown in a service somewhere or something?) without the OS dying, the same issue could still appear that ipcRecover fixes.  That said, I dont think we need to merge ipcRecover in 0.6, its more of a safety net and being (hopefully) this late in the 0.6 release cycle, I dont think merging it would be the best choice.\n",
