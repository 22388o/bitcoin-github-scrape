TheBlueMatt,2012-03-25T20:30:01Z,It seems to be a (somewhat hacky) workaround to https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5392\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/986#issuecomment-4684399,4684399,
TheBlueMatt,2012-03-25T20:32:36Z,"Note that because /all/ of boost::interprocess is implemented in headers, this patch can be applied in contrib/gitian-descriptors/gitian-win32.yml or contrib/gitian-descriptors/boost-win32.yml\nI chose boost-win32.yml as it seemed more sane, but it does mean everyone ~~has~~ gets to rebuild boost\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/986#issuecomment-4684418,4684418,
Diapolo,2012-03-25T22:15:18Z,"Prove me wrong, isn't boost::interprocess a compiled lib? It would make sense to get that bug fixed with the boost guys and use a safe work-around until this is done and we can upgrade.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/986#issuecomment-4685305,4685305,
TheBlueMatt,2012-03-25T23:16:23Z,"Though boost is a collection of compiled libs, as it turns out, boost::interprocess isnt.  If you look in the boost source at boost/interprocess you will notice that there are no files that end in .cpp, all of them are hpp (header files).  Nothing is compiled to a library in boost::interprocess.  \nAnd, yes, it would be much better to have a nice workaround in bitcoin and let the boost guys fix th",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/986#issuecomment-4685806,4685806,

Diapolo,2012-03-26T05:40:49Z,"I tested your fix and what it does (and what I should have observed before), is to create a directory in the boost_interprocess folder whose name is based on the Windows bootup time. This is broken in the official 1.47 and 1.49, too.\n\nI suggest we combine your work here and my work (with ipcRecover()), as there still could be a chance to have an orphan message queue file, but only during the cur",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/986#issuecomment-4688212,4688212,
TheBlueMatt,2012-03-26T05:48:08Z,"Yea, I dont think the two are at all mutually exclusive.  If boost's interprocess stuff were to die with bitcoin (not sure how boost handles it, did I read that it was thrown in a service somewhere or something?) without the OS dying, the same issue could still appear that ipcRecover fixes.  That said, I dont think we need to merge ipcRecover in 0.6, its more of a safety net and being (hopefully) ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/986#issuecomment-4688267,4688267,
Diapolo,2012-03-26T06:06:21Z,"I updated it a few minutes ago, but I have no problem with getting it integreated into early 0.7. It were many many hours of debugging and trial and error, so it would be very nice, to include it :).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/986#issuecomment-4688406,4688406,
sipa,2012-03-31T13:53:31Z,"The patch looks sane to me, the only thing we have to make sure is that it remains compatible with a range of boost releases (past and future...).\n\nAlso, I don't really like how this is limited to gitian builds. Is it impossible to do from qmake?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/986#issuecomment-4858548,4858548,
Diapolo,2012-04-01T12:23:18Z,"It would make sens to get this integrated with boost, so we would not have to handle it in the future.
