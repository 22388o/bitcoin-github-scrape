gmaxwell,2013-03-24T17:02:31Z,@Bobalot  Can you walk me through what problem this solves that isn't solved equally well by just polling once a second (to a few seconds)?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2364#issuecomment-15362669,15362669,
jgarzik,2013-03-24T20:41:13Z,Per-tx events are going to average at least once per second.  For this patch -- yuck -- you are continually running new OS processes.  It is far more efficient to combine stock bitcoind with https://github.com/jgarzik/pynode/tree/mini-node if you simply want to see all transactions that are accepted (and relayed) by bitcoind.\n\nTherefore this patch and polling are both the wrong solutions IMO.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2364#issuecomment-15368712,15368712,
gmaxwell,2013-03-24T20:57:33Z,"My point about polling was that new transactions are coming in at more than once per second, so simply polling every few seconds will be less work, no dos exposure, and can still give acceptable responsiveness.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2364#issuecomment-15369061,15369061,

Bobalot,2013-04-05T12:39:19Z,"I guess you're right, launching a new process is a terrible thing to do on every transaction. This was really just an ugly hack, having found mini-node it seems using that would be a much easier and safer way to achieve what I wanted.\n\n@gavinandresen it isn't really a good idea to implement this, but the same can be said for -blocknotify and -walletnotify, if they only create further code to rev",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2364#issuecomment-15953334,15953334,
