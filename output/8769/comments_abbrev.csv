unsystemizer,2016-09-21T16:20:05Z,"@paveljanik - yep, sorry. The whole idea of this PR was to make a single-commit change because I couldn't get rebase to work, but I was tired and only noticed it after I submitted the PR (by then fixing that would necessitate another rebase - back to square 1!). It was very late so I thought to try to rebase this PR later. \n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8769#issuecomment-248664268,248664268,
