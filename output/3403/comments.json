    "body": "I had a similar idea about this once, though never got around to implementing it:\n- One other use case for whitelisted nodes is always-relay-everything; e.g. if you have an internal network with several nodes behind a single frontend node, you want their wallet broadcasts to be relayed, and more than just the first time.\n- Just using addresses doesn't suffice. Right now, we never ban localhost, and that isn't optimal, as it means never banning incoming onion connections.\n- We could have a -whiteport, which adds another P2P listening port, but connections to it are automatically whitelisted. For outgoing connections, a -addwhitenode or something could exist. In general, I don't think using IP-based filtering is optimal here - for outgoing connections you want to connect to them anyway, and for incoming connections IP filtering doesn't suffice.\n",
