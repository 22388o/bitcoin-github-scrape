In light of that it should say instead:\n\n> their serving infrastructure and not sell or transfer control of their\n> DNSseed.\n\nThe expectations here are largely not directly enforceable by technology (or we wouldn't need to ask for them, they'd just be enforced), so there is a degree of reliance on honest behavior by operators.  What I want to address here is the risk that some anonymous party comes up with a way to exploit the position of being a DNS seed for a dishonest end and they offer to buy control of a DNSseed from an existing operator (without mentioning their intended attack). An honest operator should, per these expectations (if not common sense first), refuse such a request.\n",

For the granularity of data to be released to the public some are pushing for total silence.\n\nI'm ok with these if everybody agrees, but the current formulation is ambiguous as it concentrates on logs of individual queries, which is why I started asking about aggregated data.\n",
