        "patch": "@@ -0,0 +1,52 @@\n+Expectations for DNS Seed operators\n+====================================\n+\n+Bitcoin Core attempts to minimize the level of trust in DNS seeds,\n+but DNS seeds still pose a small amount of risk for the network.\n+Other implementations of Bitcoin software may also use the same\n+seeds and may be more exposed. In light of this exposure this\n+document establishes some basic expectations for the expectations\n+for the operation of dnsseeds.\n+\n+0. A DNS seed operating organization or person is expected\n+to follow good host security practices and maintain control of\n+their serving infrastructure and not sell or transfer control of their\n+DNS seed. Any hosting services contracted by the operator are\n+equally expected to uphold these expectations.\n+\n+1. The DNS seed results must consist exclusively of fairly selected and\n+functioning Bitcoin nodes from the public network to the best of the\n+operators understanding and capability.\n+\n+2. For the avoidance of doubt, the results may be randomized but must not\n+single-out any group of hosts to receive different results unless due to an\n+urgent technical necessity and disclosed.\n+\n+3. The results may not be served with a DNS TTL of less than one minute.\n+\n+4. Any logging of DNS queries should be only that which is necessary\n+for the operation of the service or urgent health of the Bitcoin\n+network and must not be retained longer than necessary or disclosed\n+to any third party.\n+\n+5. Information gathered as a result of the operators node-spidering\n+(not from DNS queries) may be freely published or retained, but only\n+if this data was not made more complete by biasing node connectivity\n+(a violation of expectation (1)).\n+\n+6. Operators are encouraged, but not required, to publicly document the\n+details of their operating practices.\n+\n+7. A reachable email contact address must be published for inquiries\n+related to the DNS seed operation.\n+\n+If these expectations cannot be satisfied the operator should\n+discontinue providing services and contact the active Bitcoin\n+Core development team as well as posting on bitcoin-development.\n+\n+Behavior outside of these expectations may be reasonable in some\n+situations but should be discussed in public in advance.\n+\n+See also\n+----------\n+- [bitcoin-seeder](https://github.com/sipa/bitcoin-seeder) is a reference implementation of a DNS seed."
