    "body": "Closing,\n1) requires nak'd commit that accepts non-standard transactions\n2) \"status: deferred\" could be for a long time\n3) this is an active area of Gavin work too, and so I think it is fair to require some discussion (on bitcoin-devel?) before proposing fee calculation or fee RPC changes.  You will note that #1647 is on the list for 0.7, so hopefully that illustrates we are being fair in this area, and merging discussed items.\n",
