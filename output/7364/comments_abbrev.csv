luke-jr,2016-01-17T19:25:35Z,"Seems like QFont() has the same problems? Makes more sense to scale fixedFontInfo than to scale some other font's default size. Besides, we got that Qt5 thing since then?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7364#issuecomment-172369049,172369049,
MarcoFalke,2016-01-17T19:31:14Z,"> Makes more sense to scale fixedFontInfo than to scale some other font's default size\n\nPreviously we had a ""default font"", so that's the reference. Though, you are welcome to change that.\n\n> Besides, we got that Qt5 thing since then?\n\nDoesn't change anything for Windows or Linux. Only a different font for OS X.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7364#issuecomment-172369379,172369379,
