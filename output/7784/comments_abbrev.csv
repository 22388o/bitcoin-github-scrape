morcos,2016-04-02T13:25:01Z,"@laanwj Yeah I hate these things as well.  But the right answer is not to write them more clearly but to get rid of the need to manually calculate them.  They are not magic values but just the mechanical result of subtracting valueOut from valueIn.  They used to just be random values but then mining code was changed to depend on the value in CTxMemPoolEntry instead of calculating it itself, and so",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7784#issuecomment-204716158,204716158,

It means it's possible to see where the number comes from.\n(this is not just idle aesthetics by me, but I know at some point the test will need to be updated, and tons of numbers without clear e",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7784#issuecomment-204950890,204950890,
