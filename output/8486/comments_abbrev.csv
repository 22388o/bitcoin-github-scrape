morcos,2016-09-26T12:03:08Z,@laanwj I was about to comment but wanted to test first.  Doesn't his make setting a minrelaytxfee of 0 possible whereas it previously wasn't?  That might be OK but just wanted to point it out.  \n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8486#issuecomment-249551188,249551188,

Not sure if this is a problem, but I don't think it was intended.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8486#issuecomment-249554383,249554383,
sipa,2016-08-10T05:35:26Z,Minrelayfee influences more than the fee you pay yourself. Isn't it a bit confusing to advertize it as just that?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8486#discussion_r74187761,74187761,src/init.cpp
sipa,2016-08-10T05:36:19Z,Use AmountHighWarn here as well?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8486#discussion_r74187812,74187812,src/wallet/wallet.cpp
MarcoFalke,2016-08-10T07:18:25Z,"Right, but this is irrelevant for the wallet. If you run with the wallet disabled, you can use minrelayfee with the feefilter to approach a `-blocksonly` mode for minrelayfee → ∞.\n\nWith the wallet enabled, it should warn when you are about to pay a fee too high.\n\nI have moved this code to wallet.cpp to make that clearer.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8486#discussion_r74196133,74196133,src/init.cpp

luke-jr,2016-08-29T03:13:26Z,Why is this being rearranged? It seems functionally identical except missing the n>0 check?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8486#discussion_r76548870,76548870,src/init.cpp
MarcoFalke,2016-08-29T07:47:33Z,"We don't use the `n>0` elsewhere because it is redundant:\n\n```\nsrc/test/util_tests.cpp:    BOOST_CHECK(!ParseMoney(""-1"", ret));\n```\n\nAlso, the syntax is preferable:\n\n``` cpp\nif(fail)\n  return;\ndoStuff();\n```\n\nvs\n\n``` cpp\nif(!fail)\n  doStuff();\nelse\n  return;\n```\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8486#discussion_r76565733,76565733,src/init.cpp
