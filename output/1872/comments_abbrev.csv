gmaxwell,2012-10-02T13:00:25Z,@gavinandresen  Ah. Thanks.  I'm pretty sure thats just from adding an empty group after encountering a transaction where it can't add any linked ins or outs.   Pushing a revised patch that I expect will fix that (though I don't have a reproduction setup right now).    It might be helpful to encrypt that wallet with some impossible key and post it.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1872#issuecomment-9069867,9069867,
