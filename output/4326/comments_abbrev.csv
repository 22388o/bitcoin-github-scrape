laanwj,2014-06-11T15:55:48Z,"Hmm I just realize that we have the same information in getblockchaininfo, there it also uses the datadir name to identify the network.

laanwj,2014-06-12T06:45:58Z,Yes - I was initially against putting the BIP70 names on ChainParams as it was seemingly a UI-only thing @jtimon  but with the field in `getblockchaininfo` it makes sense to move it to the core anyway.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4326#issuecomment-45835196,45835196,
