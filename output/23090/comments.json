As others have said, unfortunately this change is a bit too nuanced to be worth the cosmetic change and has already received NACKs, so I'm going to have to close it sorry.\r\n\r\nAs michaelfolkson said, please do check out the `good-first-issue` tag for some good starting-point issues that you might like to help with \ud83d\ude42 Look forward to further contributions in future!",
