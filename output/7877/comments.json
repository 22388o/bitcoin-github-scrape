(Also serialization seems to be fast enough that it's not worth worrying about doing it for each peer.)\n",

    "body": "> I was wondering what the memory usage ratio was between a CTransaction and its serialization; it seems to be about 1.4x as big, which is small enough that it should be better to store the CTransaction than both of the serializations that would generally be needed post-segwit. (Also serialization seems to be fast enough that it's not worth worrying about doing it for each peer.)\n\nThanks for checking this, it was in the back of my mind as well.\n",
