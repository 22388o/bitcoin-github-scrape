A \"dust limit\" is fine. Building ways to block specific addresses into the client itself isn't.\n\nAdditionally any \"dust limit\" should be written in a way that the behavior is predictable; end users are harmed when they don't have any idea what the dust limit might be set to.\n",

Not just \"I should do this because some website said to click here for awesomeness\". ... though my level of horror at this pull request is somewhat tempered by the fact that it's easily avoided by someone using Bitcoin properly (not reusing addresses).\n\nStill, NAK.\n\nIt's also worth noting that inconsistent forwarding rules created by the dust setting makes it much harder to write reliable wallet software... since the software doesn't actually know when its peers are going to forward the transaction or not (and your peers don't tell you when they don't). Ultimately wallets will need to deal with that, but they don't currently.\n\nI'd prefer to see a pull request that depriortizes all address reuse, as that will allow reusers with standing relationships to opt into lower priority handling and it encourages blacklisting resistant behavior in our ecosystem.\n",
