It provides a way to be reasonably sure that the\n-executables are really built from the source on GitHub. It also makes sure that\n-the same, tested dependencies are used and statically built into the executable.\n-\n-Multiple developers build the source code by following a specific descriptor\n-(\"recipe\"), cryptographically sign the result, and upload the resulting signature.\n-These results are compared and only if they match, the build is accepted and uploaded\n-to bitcoin.org.\n-\n-More independent Gitian builders are needed, which is why this guide exists.\n-It is preferred you follow these steps yourself instead of using someone else's\n-VM image to avoid 'contaminating' the build.\n-\n-Table of Contents\n-------------------\n-\n-- [Create a new VirtualBox VM](#create-a-new-virtualbox-vm)\n-- [Connecting to the VM](#connecting-to-the-vm)\n-- [Setting up Debian for Gitian building](#setting-up-debian-for-gitian-building)\n-- [Installing Gitian](#installing-gitian)\n-- [Setting up the Gitian image](#setting-up-the-gitian-image)\n-- [Getting and building the inputs](#getting-and-building-the-inputs)\n-- [Building Bitcoin Core](#building-bitcoin-core)\n-- [Building an alternative repository](#building-an-alternative-repository)\n-- [Signing externally](#signing-externally)\n-- [Uploading signatures](#uploading-signatures)\n-\n-Preparing the Gitian builder host\n----------------------------------\n-\n-The first step is to prepare the host environment that will be used to perform the Gitian builds.\n-This guide explains how to set up the environment, and how to start the builds.\n-\n-Debian Linux was chosen as the host distribution because it has a lightweight install (in contrast to Ubuntu) and is readily available.\n-Any kind of virtualization can be used, for example:\n-- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) (covered by this guide)\n-- [KVM](http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page)\n-- [LXC](https://linuxcontainers.org/), see also [Gitian host docker container](https://github.com/gdm85/tenku/tree/master/docker/gitian-bitcoin-host/README.md).\n-\n-You can also install Gitian on actual hardware instead of using virtualization.\n-\n-Create a new VirtualBox VM\n----------------------------\n-In the VirtualBox GUI click \"New\" and choose the following parameters in the wizard:\n-\n-![](gitian-building/create_new_vm.png)\n-\n-- Type: Linux, Debian (64-bit)\n-\n-![](gitian-building/create_vm_memsize.png)\n-\n-- Memory Size: at least 3000MB, anything less and the build might not complete.\n-\n-![](gitian-building/create_vm_hard_disk.png)\n-\n-- Hard Disk: Create a virtual hard disk now\n-\n-![](gitian-building/create_vm_hard_disk_file_type.png)\n-\n-- Hard Disk file type: Use the default, VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image)\n-\n-![](gitian-building/create_vm_storage_physical_hard_disk.png)\n-\n-- Storage on physical hard disk: Dynamically Allocated\n-\n-![](gitian-building/create_vm_file_location_size.png)\n-\n-- File location and size: at least 40GB; as low as 20GB *may* be possible, but better to err on the safe side\n-- Click `Create`\n-\n-After creating the VM, we need to configure it.\n-\n-- Click the `Settings` button, then go to `System` tab and `Processor` sub-tab. Increase the number of processors to the number of cores on your machine if you want builds to be faster.\n-\n-![](gitian-building/system_settings.png)\n-\n-- Go to the `Network` tab. Adapter 1 should be attached to `NAT`.\n-\n-![](gitian-building/network_settings.png)\n-\n-- Click `Advanced`, then `Port Forwarding`. We want to set up a port through which we can reach the VM to get files in and out.\n-- Create a new rule by clicking the plus icon.\n-\n-![](gitian-building/port_forwarding_rules.png)\n-\n-- Set up the new rule the following way:\n-  - Name: `SSH`\n-  - Protocol: `TCP`\n-  - Leave Host IP empty\n-  - Host Port: `22222`\n-  - Leave Guest IP empty\n-  - Guest Port: `22`\n-\n-- Click `Ok` twice to save.\n-\n-Get the [Debian 8.x net installer](http://cdimage.debian.org/mirror/cdimage/archive/8.5.0/amd64/iso-cd/debian-8.5.0-amd64-netinst.iso) (a more recent minor version should also work, see also [Debian Network installation](https://www.debian.org/CD/netinst/)).\n-This DVD image can be [validated](https://www.debian.org/CD/verify) using a SHA256 hashing tool, for example on\n-Unixy OSes by entering the following in a terminal:\n-\n-    echo \"ad4e8c27c561ad8248d5ebc1d36eb172f884057bfeb2c22ead823f59fa8c3dff  debian-8.5.0-amd64-netinst.iso\" | sha256sum -c\n-    # (must return OK)\n-\n-Then start the VM. On the first launch you will be asked for a CD or DVD image. Choose the downloaded ISO.\n-\n-![](gitian-building/select_startup_disk.png)\n-\n-Installing Debian\n-------------------\n-\n-This section will explain how to install Debian on the newly created VM.\n-\n-- Choose the non-graphical installer.  We do not need the graphical environment; it will only increase installation time and disk usage.\n-\n-![](gitian-building/debian_install_1_boot_menu.png)\n-\n-**Note**: Navigating in the Debian installer:\n-To keep a setting at the default and proceed, just press `Enter`.\n-To select a different button, press `Tab`.\n-\n-- Choose locale and keyboard settings (doesn't matter, you can just go with the defaults or select your own information)\n-\n-![](gitian-building/debian_install_2_select_a_language.png)\n-![](gitian-building/debian_install_3_select_location.png)\n-![](gitian-building/debian_install_4_configure_keyboard.png)\n-\n-- The VM will detect network settings using DHCP, this should all proceed automatically\n-- Configure the network:\n-  - Hostname `debian`.\n-  - Leave domain name empty.\n-\n-![](gitian-building/debian_install_5_configure_the_network.png)\n-![](gitian-building/debian_install_6_domain_name.png)\n-\n-- Choose a root password and enter it twice (remember it for later)\n-\n-![](gitian-building/debian_install_6a_set_up_root_password.png)\n-\n-- Name the new user `debian` (the full name doesn't matter, you can leave it empty)\n-- Set the account username as `debian`\n-\n-![](gitian-building/debian_install_7_set_up_user_fullname.png)\n-![](gitian-building/debian_install_8_set_up_username.png)\n-\n-- Choose a user password and enter it twice (remember it for later)\n-\n-![](gitian-building/debian_install_9_user_password.png)\n-\n-- The installer will set up the clock using a time server; this process should be automatic\n-- Set up the clock: choose a time zone (depends on the locale settings that you picked earlier; specifics don't matter)  \n-\n-![](gitian-building/debian_install_10_configure_clock.png)\n-\n-- Disk setup\n-  - Partitioning method: Guided - Use the entire disk\n-\n-![](gitian-building/debian_install_11_partition_disks.png)\n-\n-  - Select disk to partition: SCSI1 (0,0,0)\n-\n-![](gitian-building/debian_install_12_choose_disk.png)\n-\n-  - Partition Disks -> *All files in one partition*\n-\n-![](gitian-building/all_files_in_one_partition.png)\n-\n-  - Finish partitioning and write changes to disk -> *Yes* (`Tab`, `Enter` to select the `Yes` button)\n-\n-![](gitian-building/debian_install_14_finish.png)\n-![](gitian-building/debian_install_15_write_changes.png)\n-\n-- The base system will be installed, this will take a minute or so\n-- Choose a mirror (any will do)\n-\n-![](gitian-building/debian_install_16_choose_a_mirror.png)\n-\n-- Enter proxy information (unless you are on an intranet, leave this empty)\n-\n-![](gitian-building/debian_install_18_proxy_settings.png)\n-\n-- Wait a bit while 'Select and install software' runs\n-- Participate in popularity contest -> *No*\n-- Choose software to install. We need just the base system.\n-- Make sure only 'SSH server' and 'Standard System Utilities' are checked\n-- Uncheck 'Debian Desktop Environment' and 'Print Server'\n-\n-![](gitian-building/debian_install_19_software_selection.png)\n-\n-- Install the GRUB boot loader to the master boot record? -> Yes\n-\n-![](gitian-building/debian_install_20_install_grub.png)\n-\n-- Device for boot loader installation -> ata-VBOX_HARDDISK\n-\n-![](gitian-building/debian_install_21_install_grub_bootloader.png)\n-\n-- Installation Complete -> *Continue*\n-- After installation, the VM will reboot and you will have a working Debian VM. Congratulations!\n-\n-![](gitian-building/debian_install_22_finish_installation.png)\n-\n-\n-After Installation\n--------------------\n-The next step in the guide involves logging in as root via SSH.\n-SSH login for root users is disabled by default, so we'll enable that now.\n-\n-Login to the VM using username `root` and the root password you chose earlier.\n-You'll be presented with a screen similar to this.\n-\n-![](gitian-building/debian_root_login.png)\n-\n-Type:\n-\n-```\n-sed -i 's/^PermitRootLogin.*/PermitRootLogin yes/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config\n-```\n-and press enter. Then,\n-```\n-/etc/init.d/ssh restart\n-```\n-and enter to restart SSH. Logout by typing 'logout' and pressing 'enter'.\n-\n-Connecting to the VM\n-----------------------\n-\n-After the VM has booted you can connect to it using SSH, and files can be copied from and to the VM using a SFTP utility.\n-Connect to `localhost`, port `22222` (or the port configured when installing the VM).\n-On Windows you can use [putty](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html) and [WinSCP](http://winscp.net/eng/index.php).\n-\n-For example, to connect as `root` from a Linux command prompt use\n-\n-    $ ssh root@localhost -p 22222\n-    The authenticity of host '[localhost]:22222 ([127.0.0.1]:22222)' can't be established.\n-    RSA key fingerprint is ae:f5:c8:9f:17:c6:c7:1b:c2:1b:12:31:1d:bb:d0:c7.\n-    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes\n-    Warning: Permanently added '[localhost]:22222' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.\n-    root@localhost's password: (enter root password configured during install)\n-\n-    The programs included with the Debian GNU/Linux system are free software;\n-    the exact distribution terms for each program are described in the\n-    individual files in /usr/share/doc/*/copyright.\n-\n-    Debian GNU/Linux comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY, to the extent\n-    permitted by applicable law.\n-    root@debian:~#\n-\n-Replace `root` with `debian` to log in as user.\n-\n-Setting up Debian for Gitian building\n---------------------------------------\n-\n-In this section we will be setting up the Debian installation for Gitian building.\n-\n-First we need to log in as `root` to set up dependencies and make sure that our\n-user can use the sudo command. Type/paste the following in the terminal:\n-\n-```bash\n-apt-get install git ruby sudo apt-cacher-ng qemu-utils debootstrap lxc python-cheetah parted kpartx bridge-utils make ubuntu-archive-keyring curl\n-adduser debian sudo\n-```\n-\n-Then set up LXC and the rest with the following, which is a complex jumble of settings and workarounds:\n-\n-```bash\n-# the version of lxc-start in Debian needs to run as root, so make sure\n-# that the build script can execute it without providing a password\n-echo \"%sudo ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/lxc-start\" > /etc/sudoers.d/gitian-lxc\n-echo \"%sudo ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/lxc-execute\" >> /etc/sudoers.d/gitian-lxc\n-# make /etc/rc.local script that sets up bridge between guest and host\n-echo '#!/bin/sh -e' > /etc/rc.local\n-echo 'brctl addbr br0' >> /etc/rc.local\n-echo 'ifconfig br0 10.0.3.2/24 up' >> /etc/rc.local\n-echo 'iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE' >> /etc/rc.local\n-echo 'echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward' >> /etc/rc.local\n-echo 'exit 0' >> /etc/rc.local\n-# make sure that USE_LXC is always set when logging in as debian,\n-# and configure LXC IP addresses\n-echo 'export USE_LXC=1' >> /home/debian/.profile\n-echo 'export GITIAN_HOST_IP=10.0.3.2' >> /home/debian/.profile\n-echo 'export LXC_GUEST_IP=10.0.3.5' >> /home/debian/.profile\n-reboot\n-```\n-\n-At the end the VM is rebooted to make sure that the changes take effect. The steps in this\n-section only need to be performed once.\n-\n-Installing Gitian\n-------------------\n-\n-Re-login as the user `debian` that was created during installation.\n-The rest of the steps in this guide will be performed as that user.\n-\n-There is no `python-vm-builder` package in Debian, so we need to install it from source ourselves,\n-\n-```bash\n-wget http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/v/vm-builder/vm-builder_0.12.4+bzr494.orig.tar.gz\n-echo \"76cbf8c52c391160b2641e7120dbade5afded713afaa6032f733a261f13e6a8e  vm-builder_0.12.4+bzr494.orig.tar.gz\" | sha256sum -c\n-# (verification -- must return OK)\n-tar -zxvf vm-builder_0.12.4+bzr494.orig.tar.gz\n-cd vm-builder-0.12.4+bzr494\n-sudo python setup.py install\n-cd ..\n-```\n-\n-**Note**: When sudo asks for a password, enter the password for the user *debian* not for *root*.\n-\n-Clone the git repositories for bitcoin and Gitian.\n-\n-```bash\n-git clone https://github.com/devrandom/gitian-builder.git\n-git clone https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin\n-git clone https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gitian.sigs.git\n-```\n-\n-Setting up the Gitian image\n--------------------------\n-\n-Gitian needs a virtual image of the operating system to build in.\n-Currently this is Ubuntu Trusty x86_64.\n-This image will be copied and used every time that a build is started to\n-make sure that the build is deterministic.\n-Creating the image will take a while, but only has to be done once.\n-\n-Execute the following as user `debian`:\n-\n-```bash\n-cd gitian-builder\n-bin/make-base-vm --lxc --arch amd64 --suite trusty\n-```\n-\n-There will be a lot of warnings printed during the build of the image. These can be ignored.\n-\n-**Note**: When sudo asks for a password, enter the password for the user *debian* not for *root*.\n-\n-Getting and building the inputs\n---------------------------------\n-\n-At this point you have two options, you can either use the automated script (found in [contrib/gitian-build.sh](/contrib/gitian-build.sh)) or you could manually do everything by following this guide. If you're using the automated script, then run it with the \"--setup\" command. Afterwards, run it with the \"--build\" command (example: \"contrib/gitian-build.sh -b signer 0.13.0\"). Otherwise ignore this.\n-\n-Follow the instructions in [doc/release-process.md](release-process.md#fetch-and-create-inputs-first-time-or-when-dependency-versions-change)\n-in the bitcoin repository under 'Fetch and create inputs' to install sources which require\n-manual intervention. Also optionally follow the next step: 'Seed the Gitian sources cache\n-and offline git repositories' which will fetch the remaining files required for building\n-offline.\n-\n-Building Bitcoin Core\n-----------------\n-\n-To build Bitcoin Core (for Linux, OS X and Windows) just follow the steps under 'perform\n-Gitian builds' in [doc/release-process.md](release-process.md#setup-and-perform-gitian-builds) in the bitcoin repository.\n-\n-This may take some time as it will build all the dependencies needed for each descriptor.\n-These dependencies will be cached after a successful build to avoid rebuilding them when possible.\n-\n-At any time you can check the package installation and build progress with\n-\n-```bash\n-tail -f var/install.log\n-tail -f var/build.log\n-```\n-\n-Output from `gbuild` will look something like\n-\n-    Initialized empty Git repository in /home/debian/gitian-builder/inputs/bitcoin/.git/\n-    remote: Counting objects: 57959, done.\n-    remote: Total 57959 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 57958\n-    Receiving objects: 100% (57959/57959), 53.76 MiB | 484.00 KiB/s, done.\n-    Resolving deltas: 100% (41590/41590), done.\n-    From https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin\n-    ... (new tags, new branch etc)\n-    --- Building for trusty amd64 ---\n-    Stopping target if it is up\n-    Making a new image copy\n-    stdin: is not a tty\n-    Starting target\n-    Checking if target is up\n-    Preparing build environment\n-    Updating apt-get repository (log in var/install.log)\n-    Installing additional packages (log in var/install.log)\n-    Grabbing package manifest\n-    stdin: is not a tty\n-    Creating build script (var/build-script)\n-    lxc-start: Connection refused - inotify event with no name (mask 32768)\n-    Running build script (log in var/build.log)\n-\n-Building an alternative repository\n------------------------------------\n-\n-If you want to do a test build of a pull on GitHub it can be useful to point\n-the Gitian builder at an alternative repository, using the same descriptors\n-and inputs.\n-\n-For example:\n-```bash\n-URL=https://github.com/laanwj/bitcoin.git\n-COMMIT=2014_03_windows_unicode_path\n-./bin/gbuild --commit bitcoin=${COMMIT} --url bitcoin=${URL} ../bitcoin/contrib/gitian-descriptors/gitian-linux.yml\n-./bin/gbuild --commit bitcoin=${COMMIT} --url bitcoin=${URL} ../bitcoin/contrib/gitian-descriptors/gitian-win.yml\n-./bin/gbuild --commit bitcoin=${COMMIT} --url bitcoin=${URL} ../bitcoin/contrib/gitian-descriptors/gitian-osx.yml\n-```\n-\n-Building fully offline\n------------------------\n-\n-For building fully offline including attaching signatures to unsigned builds, the detached-sigs repository\n-and the bitcoin git repository with the desired tag must both be available locally, and then gbuild must be\n-told where to find them. It also requires an apt-cacher-ng which is fully-populated but set to offline mode, or\n-manually disabling gitian-builder's use of apt-get to update the VM build environment.\n-\n-To configure apt-cacher-ng as an offline cacher, you will need to first populate its cache with the relevant\n-files. You must additionally patch target-bin/bootstrap-fixup to set its apt sources to something other than\n-plain archive.ubuntu.com: us.archive.ubuntu.com works.\n-\n-So, if you use LXC:\n-\n-```bash\n-export PATH=\"$PATH\":/path/to/gitian-builder/libexec\n-export USE_LXC=1\n-cd /path/to/gitian-builder\n-./libexec/make-clean-vm --suite trusty --arch amd64\n-\n-LXC_ARCH=amd64 LXC_SUITE=trusty on-target -u root apt-get update\n-LXC_ARCH=amd64 LXC_SUITE=trusty on-target -u root \\\n-  -e DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get --no-install-recommends -y install \\\n-  $( sed -ne '/^packages:/,/[^-] .*/ {/^- .*/{s/\"//g;s/- //;p}}' ../bitcoin/contrib/gitian-descriptors/*|sort|uniq )\n-LXC_ARCH=amd64 LXC_SUITE=trusty on-target -u root apt-get -q -y purge grub\n-LXC_ARCH=amd64 LXC_SUITE=trusty on-target -u root -e DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get -y dist-upgrade\n-```\n-\n-And then set offline mode for apt-cacher-ng:\n-\n-```\n-/etc/apt-cacher-ng/acng.conf\n-[...]\n-Offlinemode: 1\n-[...]\n-\n-service apt-cacher-ng restart\n-```\n-\n-Then when building, override the remote URLs that gbuild would otherwise pull from the Gitian descriptors::\n-```bash\n-\n-cd /some/root/path/\n-git clone https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-detached-sigs.git\n-\n-BTCPATH=/some/root/path/bitcoin\n-SIGPATH=/some/root/path/bitcoin-detached-sigs\n-\n-./bin/gbuild --url bitcoin=${BTCPATH},signature=${SIGPATH} ../bitcoin/contrib/gitian-descriptors/gitian-win-signer.yml\n-```\n-\n-Signing externally\n--------------------\n-\n-If you want to do the PGP signing on another device, that's also possible; just define `SIGNER` as mentioned\n-and follow the steps in the build process as normal.\n-\n-    gpg: skipped \"laanwj\": secret key not available\n-\n-When you execute `gsign` you will get an error from GPG, which can be ignored. Copy the resulting `.assert` files\n-in `gitian.sigs` to your signing machine and do\n-\n-```bash\n-    gpg --detach-sign ${VERSION}-linux/${SIGNER}/bitcoin-linux-build.assert\n-    gpg --detach-sign ${VERSION}-win/${SIGNER}/bitcoin-win-build.assert\n-    gpg --detach-sign ${VERSION}-osx-unsigned/${SIGNER}/bitcoin-osx-build.assert\n-```\n-\n-This will create the `.sig` files that can be committed together with the `.assert` files to assert your\n-Gitian build.\n-\n-Uploading signatures\n----------------------\n-\n-After building and signing you can push your signatures (both the `.assert` and `.assert.sig` files) to the\n-[bitcoin-core/gitian.sigs](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gitian.sigs/) repository, or if that's not possible create a pull\n-request. You can also mail the files to Wladimir (laanwj@gmail.com) and he will commit them.\n+This file was moved to [the Bitcoin Core documentation repository](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/docs/blob/master/gitian-building.md) at [https://github.com/bitcoin-core/docs](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/docs)."
