    "body": "There are a couple of major problems with this change - which isn't necessary in the first place.\n\nFirst off, the transaction will not get accepted into the memory pool, because AcceptToMemoryPool verifies that the transaction has enough fees embedded in it to satisfy GetMinFee(). But when you created the transaction, you suppressed those fees.\n\nEven if you applied similar modifications to AcceptToMemoryPool, no other node will accept your transaction, because the other nodes will <i>not</i> suppress the calculation of GetMinFee(). That means that only your node will attempt to put the transaction into a block. Unless you're running one of those multi-GH/s nodes, it could be months before you win the crap shoot and generate the block. And that's assuming that the node even generates blocks to begin with. You can't assume that every node will be generating blocks - I turn off coin generation on my MacBook because I don't want to overstress the CPU if I can help it.\n\nIn any case, the code change is not necessary. If you do happen to be the lucky guy who generates the block containing your own transactions, then the transaction fees all go into your wallet, making your own transactions free.\n",
