MarcoFalke,2017-06-19T16:21:14Z,"I doubt any user will download and read the source code to look for documentation of command line args. The documentation should be put in the manpages.\n\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10626#issuecomment-309491598,309491598,
laanwj,2017-06-24T08:10:38Z,Adding a more accurate comment could be done later - let's remove the inaccurate one at least. It's better to have no documentation comments than deceiving one.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10626#issuecomment-310824146,310824146,
