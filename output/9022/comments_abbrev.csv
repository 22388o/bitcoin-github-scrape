If 10.7's C++11 libraries are broken, how can it?\n\nWe ran into something with Armory that sounds similar. IIRC, there was a C++11 call that was present in libc before 2.17 came out, at which point it was moved to librt. If you compiled in Ubuntu 12.04, the call would picked up in ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9022#issuecomment-256811049,256811049,

We compile against 10.9's c++ libraries which probably must have ABI differences to 10.7 ones.\nBut better ask @theuni to be certain.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9022#issuecomment-256903345,256903345,
