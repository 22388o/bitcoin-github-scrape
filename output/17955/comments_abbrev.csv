hebasto,2020-01-19 08:41:44,"> What's wrong with this?\n\nI did not say ""wrong"" ;)\nYes, it works.\n\n> The lambda functions brings it on the point\n\nCapturing `[=]` seems an unnecessary overhead. Traditional `on_pasteButton_clicked()` slot seems more expected for a such simple functionality.\n\nYou only need to define this slot. Qt makes a proper connection to `&QPushButton::clicked` signal automa**g**ically.\n\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17955#discussion_r368275971,368275971,src/qt/openuridialog.cpp
