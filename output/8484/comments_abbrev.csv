rebroad,2016-08-21T01:01:51Z,"ok, will add a commit to update option help...  shall I list each debug string e.g. ""tx, tx2, tx3""? or is it better to show the level of granularity another way, e.g. ""tx{,2,3}"" or ""tx[1:3]"", ""tx[1-3]""...? not sure if there's a standard for denoting this sort of thing.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8484#issuecomment-241232700,241232700,

rebroad,2016-08-28T09:40:55Z,"On a slightly OT note - can someone tell me how one gets notifications when someone comments on a pull request?

MarcoFalke,2016-08-26T08:23:15Z,"Î¼Nit: I was wondering if it could help to add a ""rule of thumb"" somewhere to explain when to use `category` vs. `category2`.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8484#discussion_r76381783,76381783,src/init.cpp
rebroad,2016-08-28T09:23:34Z,"@MarcoFalke Done. I propose that for future use, ""cmpctblock"" be restricted to the actual debug's relating to creation/etc of compact blocks, but for the transmission and download that block{,2} etc be used (since ""block"", ""tx"" are subsets of ""net""). Sound ok?\n\nRegarding rule of thumb, happy to do this (perhaps in a future pull) - best put into init.cpp or into a readme file somewhere?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8484#discussion_r76528849,76528849,src/init.cpp
n1bor,2016-08-29T14:19:52Z,Any reason not to add the size of the block too? Useful to analyse bandwidth usage by block height.\nAlthough that is logged in beginmessage/endmessage already so a nasty bit of awking should be able to join them together.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8484#discussion_r76614850,76614850,src/main.cpp
rebroad,2016-08-29T16:19:26Z,"do you mean log the size when sending it or when receiving it, or both?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8484#discussion_r76636970,76636970,src/main.cpp
