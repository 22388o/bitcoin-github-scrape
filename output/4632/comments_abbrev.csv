mikehearn,2014-08-11T10:08:23Z,"Thanks for working on this! Sounds like a good step towards getaddr results matching the quality of DNS seed results (so becoming more usable for spv clients).\n\nIt's hard to test this ... it could return garbage and a test node would seem to operate properly. It'd be nice if we had a tool to diff the results of getaddr.

For every getaddr about 20-30 terrible peers are avoided to be sent.\nI've examined a sample of these, and they were indeed all unconnectable.
