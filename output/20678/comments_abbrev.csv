Did this change recently?\n\nThat is correct, I've just verified on macOS BigSur 11.1 (20C69):\n```\n% brew install automake\nUpdating Homebrew...\n==> Downloading https://homebrew.bintray.com/bottles/autoconf-2.69.big_sur.bottle.4.tar.gz\nAlready downloaded: /Users/hebasto1/Library/Caches/Homebrew/downloads/0e5da6f626a43aad80",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20678#issuecomment-747382354,747382354,

For example if for some reason your `automake` install was not successful, and neither it and its dependency autoconf was installed,  you'd get exactly the same message.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20678#issuecomment-748461536,748461536,
