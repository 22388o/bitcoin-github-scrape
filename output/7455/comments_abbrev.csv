It doesn't matter with the current `.travis.yml` but it may in the future and it is not considered best practice.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7455#issuecomment-178164237,178164237,
laanwj,2016-02-02T11:28:52Z,"@theuni any ideas here? We want to terminate the test prematurely if the doc check fails, to avoid wasting resources, is there a nicer way to do this then `set -e` or `exit`?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7455#issuecomment-178519218,178519218,

MarcoFalke,2016-02-26T10:02:38Z,@laanwj The first commit should be uncontroversial and improve things considerably without making anything worse. Would you mind if I create a new pull for this commit?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7455#issuecomment-189201876,189201876,

theuni,2016-03-03T01:31:07Z,"@MarcoFalke I think it'd do what you wanted if you just bumped it up into before_script.
