droark,2017-03-27T20:35:19Z,"Just curious, any reason why rawtx was chosen over rawTx? Personally, I prefer the latter. Making everything lowercase obfuscates the fact that multiple words/abbreviations are being used. There's also some inconsistency in the code's variable names at that point. Not a big deal, just something I'm curious about.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10083#issuecomment-289577731,289577731,
MarcoFalke,2017-03-27T20:53:18Z,"@droark Feel free to use `raw_tx` if you think that it is clearer than `rawtx`. Though, the python code should stay free of camelCase in variable names of local scope.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10083#issuecomment-289582712,289582712,
