laanwj,2021-07-07 10:56:05,"> My understanding is that this is just a warning not to link objects compiled with pre- and post-7.1 together.\n\nCorrect. It doesn't apply to us while building the distribution binaries because we use the same C and C++ compilers for everything including the dependencies.\n\nACK 1edddf5de41b053049ce0b0bdbc39c2fbb743c40",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22410#issuecomment-875506040,875506040,

Also, as of GCC 11.1, the `-Wpsabi` remain undocumented:\n```bash\ng++-11 --help=warnings | grep -i abi\n  -Wabi                       Warn about things that will change when compiling with an ABI-compliant compiler.\n  -Wabi-tag        ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22410#issuecomment-876141677,876141677,
