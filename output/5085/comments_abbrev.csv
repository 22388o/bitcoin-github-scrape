theuni,2014-10-14T03:43:49Z,"I'll leave it up to the others to decide if this is really wanted, but if so, please use the usual macros for checking libs/headers so that cross works as intended. Also, if they're not found when the switch was given, configure should exit with an error.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5085#issuecomment-58986573,58986573,
luke-jr,2014-10-14T04:16:51Z,"@theuni I'm not sure what you're suggesting for cross - the usual macros would detect missing libs, but there's no pkg-config information for LevelDB, so it's just going to set the variables the same way. Shouldn't be any problem with cross-compiling regardless. Anyhow, added that for the errors.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5085#issuecomment-58988322,58988322,

laanwj,2014-10-14T06:46:45Z,"I tend to agree with @TheBlueMatt. I also remember we had this discussion before. Back then we put the bar at ""easily patchable"". Making it a configure option makes it too easy, so NACK.\n\n(The reason that we include leveldb is that it gives us control over the (consensus-critical) database, and allows patching problems that affect us before upstream if that is necessary.
