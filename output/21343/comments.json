    "body": "> It seems sub optimal that we are basically just copy pasting blocks of dependencies throughout all the build docs. Isn't the point of dependencies.md to list the dependencies, what they are, and when they are required?\n\nNot exactly copy-pasting. Naming and links are different. I don't think it would be 'better' to point to dependencies.md and have the user figure out how that dependency correlates to their system.\n\n> I think the same can be said for all of the \"configuration\" blocks. These seem to get repeated (across lots of docs) in varying combinations and levels of verbosity, and I'd think a lot of the time they might just be downright confusing to a first time builder.\n\nJust trying to improve that situation across the build docs so that it's informative in the right ways to get someone up and running with a couple of examples that are relevant.\n\n> This also includes the parts where configure output is basically pasted verbatim into documentation. i.e upnp or libnatpmp options. Can't we just tell users to look at `configure --help`? This means they'll always be getting accurate information; rather than something pasted into a build doc that now may have drifted from what actually happens.\n\nWell I was thinking that the build docs can be a one-stop place on how to get up and running. I think it would be way more confusing for a first time builder to have to hop through 3 different files and try to piece together the right information. \n\nThe information doesn't need to drift away from what's happening if it's maintained.\n\n\n\n",

Xcode Command Line Tools\n \n-```shell\n+The Xcode Command Line Tools are a collection of build tools for macOS.\n+These tools must be installed in order to build Bitcoin Core from source.\n+\n+To install, run the following command from your terminal:\n+\n+``` bash\n xcode-select --install\n ```\n \n-When the popup appears, click `Install`.\n+Upon running the command, you should see a a popup appear.\n+Click on `Install` to continue to installation process.\n \n-Then install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh).\n+### 2. Homebrew Package Manager\n \n-## Dependencies\n-```shell\n-brew install automake libtool boost miniupnpc libnatpmp pkg-config python qt libevent qrencode\n+Homebrew is a package manager for macOS that allows one to install packages from the command line easily.\n+While several package managers are available for macOS, this guide will focus on Homebrew as it is the most popular.\n+Since the examples in this guide walking through the installation of a package will use Homebrew, it is recommended that you install it to follow along.\n+\n+To install the Homebrew package manager (if not already installed), run the following command from your terminal:\n+\n+``` bash\n+/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n ```\n \n-If you run into issues, check [Homebrew's troubleshooting page](https://docs.brew.sh/Troubleshooting).\n-See [dependencies.md](dependencies.md) for a complete overview.\n+Note: If you run into issues while installing homebrew or pulling packages, refer to [Homebrew's troubleshooting page](https://docs.brew.sh/Troubleshooting).\n \n-If you want to build the disk image with `make deploy` (.dmg / optional), you need RSVG:\n-```shell\n-brew install librsvg\n+### 3.
