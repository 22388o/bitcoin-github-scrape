MarcoFalke,2020-08-11 09:15:38,"If the change stays, it needs release notes, because it is a breaking RPC change",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19696#issuecomment-671831225,671831225,
promag,2020-08-11 10:31:30,"Agree with @MarcoFalke, the change in the error isn't worth a breaking change. I'd rather document the error.\n\nOn a side note, instead of raising RPC errors, I'd return `{ ""message"": ""node not found"" }` or something like that.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19696#issuecomment-671866998,671866998,
fjahr,2020-08-11 12:09:51,I was not sure but I assume changing the error code is breaking but changing the error message is not considered breaking? I have changed the error code back and kept an improved error message that should explain the reasoning behind the error code better.
