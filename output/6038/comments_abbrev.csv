theuni,2015-04-20T23:44:25Z,"ACK for trivial. @ayeowch for the future, it'd be great if you could submit these directly to trivial-next in https://github.com/theuni/bitcoin . The idea is to pile up small changes like this one over there, to avoid burning extra review cycles in the main repo. Every few weeks those changes are then submitted as a group in a single PR for inclusion in master.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6038#issuecomment-94593826,94593826,
