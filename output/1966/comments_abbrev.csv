sipa,2012-10-29T10:30:48Z,"It seems gitian works with this (and already worked) because it first builds Bitcoin-Qt, which has some magic in its .pro file to build leveldb, and that leveldb built gets reused for the bitcoind build. That is fine of course, but we should make sure that building bitcoind separately also works, which probably means adding the ranlib magic to makefile.linux-mingw.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1966#issuecomment-9861768,9861768,
