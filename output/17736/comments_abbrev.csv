ryanofsky,2019-12-12 19:22:52,"My suggestion from IRC for dealing with windows compiler and package upgrades was to change appveyor check for pull requests from a simple pass/fail check to something more like:\n\n```sh\n(git checkout pr && make check) || (git checkout master && ! make check)\n```\n\nhttp://www.erisian.com.au/bitcoin-core-dev/log-2019-12-12.html#l-287\n\n> \<ryanofsky> i think the compromise for appveyor",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17736#issuecomment-565147532,565147532,
sipsorcery,2019-12-12 19:29:43,@ryanofsky problem is with a 90 minute cap on the job (and that's with @MarcoFalke intervening to get it from 60 to 90) there's not enough time for two builds. If you look at the appveyor history most builds are between 50 and 60 minutes. ,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17736#issuecomment-565150340,565150340,
sipsorcery,2019-12-12 19:33:04,Job failed due to the old Qt libraries being used. I'll need to add a step to invalidate the Qt cache directory if the SHA256 has changed.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17736#issuecomment-565151772,565151772,

sipsorcery,2020-11-14 20:59:24,Hmm not sure what's going on there. Visual Studio 2019 [v16.8.1](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releases/2019/release-notes#16.8.1) came out a couple of days ago and Appveyor pushed the new VS2019 image a [few hours ago](https://www.appveyor.com/updates/2020/11/14/) so it's likely to be the cause.
