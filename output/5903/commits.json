Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate\n-with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried\n-out collectively by the network. Bitcoin Core is the name of open source\n-software which enables the use of this currency.\n-\n-For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of\n-the Bitcoin Core software, see https://www.bitcoin.org/en/download.\n-\n-License\n--------\n-\n-Bitcoin Core is released under the terms of the MIT license. See [COPYING](COPYING) for more\n-information or see http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT.\n-\n-Development process\n--------------------\n-\n-Developers work in their own trees, then submit pull requests when they think\n-their feature or bug fix is ready.\n-\n-If it is a simple/trivial/non-controversial change, then one of the Bitcoin\n-development team members simply pulls it.\n-\n-If it is a *more complicated or potentially controversial* change, then the patch\n-submitter will be asked to start a discussion (if they haven't already) on the\n-[mailing list](http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=bitcoin-development).\n-\n-The patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a good thing.\n-Developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches if the code doesn't\n-match the project's coding conventions (see [doc/developer-notes.md](doc/developer-notes.md)) or are\n-controversial.\n-\n-The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be\n-completely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tags) are created\n-regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of Bitcoin.\n-\n-Testing\n--------\n-\n-Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull\n-requests than we can review and test on short notice. Please be patient and help out by testing\n-other people's pull requests, and remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people\n-lots of money.\n-\n-### Automated Testing\n-\n-Developers are strongly encouraged to write unit tests for new code, and to\n-submit new unit tests for old code. Unit tests can be compiled and run (assuming they weren't disabled in configure) with: `make check`\n-\n-Every pull request is built for both Windows and Linux on a dedicated server,\n-and unit and sanity tests are automatically run. The binaries produced may be\n-used for manual QA testing \u2014 a link to them will appear in a comment on the\n-pull request posted by [BitcoinPullTester](https://github.com/BitcoinPullTester). See https://github.com/TheBlueMatt/test-scripts\n-for the build/test scripts.\n-\n-### Manual Quality Assurance (QA) Testing\n-\n-Large changes should have a test plan, and should be tested by somebody other\n-than the developer who wrote the code.\n-See https://github.com/bitcoin/QA/ for how to create a test plan.\n-\n-Translations\n-------------\n-\n-Changes to translations as well as new translations can be submitted to\n-[Bitcoin Core's Transifex page](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/bitcoin/).\n-\n-Translations are periodically pulled from Transifex and merged into the git repository. See the\n-[translation process](doc/translation_process.md) for details on how this works.\n-\n-**Important**: We do not accept translation changes as GitHub pull requests because the next\n-pull from Transifex would automatically overwrite them again.\n-\n-Translators should also subscribe to the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bitcoin-translators)."
