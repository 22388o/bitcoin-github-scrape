MarcoFalke,2021-05-17 15:37:30,"Looks like the current templates are set up such that this fails compilation even if removed completely. Though, I am worried that in the future it will silently fall back from `float` -> `double`, so I've added the `static_assert(false)` to ensure this is never compiled.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21981#discussion_r633642120,633642120,src/serialize.h
laanwj,2021-05-17 18:04:40,I kind of hope we can remove the double case as well some time soon. But I think this is fine for now.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21981#discussion_r633746210,633746210,src/serialize.h
sipa,2021-05-17 18:06:16,"I'm fine with doing this or not. Even if it's accidentally invoked, at worst it'll result in serialization as a double, which is just 4 bytes bigger, but no loss compared to (highly hypothetical) expected float serialization.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21981#discussion_r633747296,633747296,src/serialize.h
MarcoFalke,2021-05-18 05:30:28,Should be easy to remove it in a follow-up. E.g https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21966#issuecomment-842528708,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21981#discussion_r634054347,634054347,src/serialize.h
