jtimon,2014-03-14T22:43:40Z,"@luke-jr my understanding (based on what @laanwj and @sipa have told me) is that CChainParams  should only contain constants, so I think only the functions should remain out of chainparams like @drak suggested. \nI could add those changes on this pull request or make them later (since they would make this simple pull request less likely to be accepted).

laanwj,2014-03-17T09:24:10Z,"Right, CChainParams should only contain constants. And we don't intend to support multiple POWs in bitcoin.\n\nI'm fine with moving these to a seperate file, main is much too large and this is a clearly delimited separable piece of functionality.\n\nDon't move ScanHash_CryptoPP from miner.cpp here: it's a static function and keeping the internal miner functions together makes sense.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3839#issuecomment-37796733,37796733,

jtimon,2014-06-09T19:36:29Z,While rebasing it came to mind that maybe these pow-specific constants don't really belong to chainparams. There could be a pow class with them as arguments and having these functions as methods.\nThis would make it easier for altchains to maintain: just be extending this class and overwriting the pow functions many altcoins would become trivial to maintain on top of bitcoin (less excuses to compe,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3839#issuecomment-45534052,45534052,
sipa,2014-06-09T20:26:38Z,"I don't think usefulness for derived codebases is a priority here. If code quality improvements benefit them, so much the better, but I don't think we should make our code more complex to accommodate potential forks...\n\nI like this because it moves responsibilities away from main, and the code looks sane to me (though I'd like to go over it line by line).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3839#issuecomment-45539616,45539616,
