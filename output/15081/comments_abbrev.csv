harding,2019-01-05T14:16:21Z,"@MarcoFalke I didn't check.  However, I don't believe any of the detached release notes I integrated applied to anything that had been backported to 0.17 so far, so no information should've been lost.  (I did not check pre-0.17 branches.)\n\nThe list of noteworthy changes for a typical maintenance release are much smaller than those for a major release, so I don't think the non-master branches w",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15081#issuecomment-451659283,451659283,

harding,2019-01-05T14:48:11Z,"@MarcoFalke Ah.  So far I haven't removed anything from the notes for master because of a backport.  If I do remove anything, I'll be sure that it's documented at least on the current stable branch.\n\nSomewhat related, I was wondering if it'd be useful to tag each item in the release note with the PR or PRs that went into it so that interested readers can learn more about the context.
