If I do remove anything, I'll be sure that it's documented at least on the current stable branch.\r\n\r\nSomewhat related, I was wondering if it'd be useful to tag each item in the release note with the PR or PRs that went into it so that interested readers can learn more about the context.

See the [ZMQ\n+  documentation](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/zmq.md#usage)\n+  for details.\n+\n+- The `enablebip61` option (introduced in Bitcoin Core 0.17.0) is\n+  used to toggle sending of BIP 61 reject messages. Reject messages have no use\n+  case on the P2P network and are only logged for debugging by most network\n+  nodes. The option will now by default be off for improved privacy and security\n+  as well as reduced upload usage. The option can explicitly be turned on for\n+  local-network debugging purposes.\n+\n+- The `rpcallowip` option can no longer be used to automatically listen\n+  on all network interfaces.  Instead, the `rpcbind` parameter must also\n+  be used to specify the IP addresses to listen on.  Listening for RPC\n+  commands over a public network connection is insecure and should be\n+  disabled, so a warning is now printed if a user selects such a\n+  configuration.
