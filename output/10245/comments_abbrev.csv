sipa,2017-04-21T00:19:09Z,Are you sure nothing is needed to install libevent?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10245#issuecomment-295982596,295982596,
shigeya,2017-04-21T00:33:03Z,"Yes, I could successfully build without error on FreeBSD 11.0-RELEASE-p9. I briefly tested the code with Testnet3 and looks working (although, I haven't run until getting the latest block). \n\nI decided to shut down the server for now, due to poor CPU resource. If you want more confirmation, I can provide.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10245#issuecomment-295986706,295986706,
sipa,2017-04-21T00:51:57Z,"@shigeya I don't doubt that you could build successfully, but wasn't that because somehow libevent was already installed?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10245#issuecomment-295992337,295992337,
shigeya,2017-04-21T01:10:15Z,"@sipa I was partially wrong. It was named `libevent` and not `libevent2` in `pkg`.  Although I have setup the machine recently and clean, the package was installed part of other package installation already. That's why. I have pushed amended fix. thanks.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10245#issuecomment-295998092,295998092,

laanwj,2017-04-21T08:40:22Z,"Interesting. I upgraded from an older FreeBSD so my package was still called `libevent2`. But you're right that it has been renamed.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10245#discussion_r112639843,112639843,doc/build-unix.md
