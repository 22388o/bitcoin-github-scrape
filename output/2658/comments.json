A fresh Litecoin blockchain sync and a subsequent -reindex both were uneventful.\n\nA month ago I saw loud and scary warnings during -reindex twice in a row.  I don't know what is different now.  Would a fresh sync with additional checkpoints result in a different local blockchain sans historic forks?
