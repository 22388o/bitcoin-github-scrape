kiminuo,2021-09-15 18:33:44,"> Also it would be good if PR description linked to issue #21005 as the true motivation for this PR, instead of saying that I suggested this. I think the current description which says the PR ""follows the suggestion by ryanofsky"" is a misleading, even though it is technically true, because I don't have any opinion on whether `gArgs` should be removed from wallet code, and I didn't suggest doing th",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22928#issuecomment-920276140,920276140,

Most of these uses can be replaced by `m_args`.

kiminuo,2021-09-15 16:32:17,"Thank you for the feedback! My approach overall is to progress from the bottom up. I find the way I did it here very conservative so that we are sure that nothing breaks. You are right that `m_args` can be used here, I wanted to do that later but if you find it better use `m_args` right away, then great.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22928#discussion_r709356532,709356532,src/wallet/test/ismine_tests.cpp
ryanofsky,2021-09-15 16:45:24,"Thanks! Normally I'd agree with being incremental and conservative, but if it is important to do this transition away from gArgs I think it is also important to try to make transition painless as possible to reviewers, and to other PR authors working on conflicting PRs by avoiding changing the same code multiple times in multiple PRs.\n\nMaybe changing the same code in different PRs makes sense ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22928#discussion_r709366609,709366609,src/wallet/test/ismine_tests.cpp
ryanofsky,2021-09-15 16:51:34,"In general it would be great to be to see a consolidated final PR with all the future changes in one place. Or if that is too much work, it would be good to have a roadmap describing what the future changes will be. At very least if a PR has changes that are known to be temporary, it would be good to identify which parts of the PR are temporary, and which parts are permanent in the PR description.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22928#discussion_r709371350,709371350,src/wallet/test/ismine_tests.cpp
