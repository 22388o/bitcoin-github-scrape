fanquake,2019-08-27 01:00:16,"Thanks, however this change isn't complete (the same string needs to be updated elsewhere in the repo), the commit message needs to be fixed i.e `doc: remove ""experimental"" from README.md` and it's the kind of change that will likely be nit-picked to death (i.e I think we're still experimenting), so I'm going to close.\n\nIf you're interested in [contributing](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16731#issuecomment-525090962,525090962,
