droark,2014-07-31T19:25:06Z,"~~Not really. I'm happy to give that a shot and revise the request.~~\n\nEDIT: Actually, I take that back. Looking at the documentation, it looks like that call was removed from Qt5. As I understand things from pull request #2721, Bitcoin-Qt is supposed to be compatible with Qt4 and Qt5. In fact, that's the pull request where this particular code was committed in the first place. I suppose I could",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4606#issuecomment-50806499,50806499,
droark,2014-07-31T21:05:06Z,"Okay. After doing some more digging, I think the patch should stay as is. The QPixmap::toMacCGImageRef() call was pulled from Qt5 and appears to have been reinstated in Qt5.2 as QtMac::toCGImageRef(). (See http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5/qtmac.html for more info.) Writing a patch with three paths (Qt4, Qt5.0/5.1, and Qt5.2+) seems a bit silly when we already have a path that should work across Qt4 ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4606#issuecomment-50818492,50818492,
laanwj,2014-08-01T05:49:22Z,"@droark Agreed. Instead of three #ifdef paths where this solution is used in a subset of qt versions, it's better to just use it for all so that it gets testing.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4606#issuecomment-50851136,50851136,
theuni,2014-08-01T16:23:09Z,"ACK. Works fine on 10.9.\n\nWe'll likely not be using QT < 5.2 for OSX at any point in the future, but there may be a few devs still building against it. At some point we can remove this and use the platform API if we stumble upon it again.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4606#issuecomment-50904473,50904473,
