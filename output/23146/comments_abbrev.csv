rajarshimaitra,2021-10-04 19:38:53,"Probably it would read a little clearly if  instead of counting `walletconflicts` in `conflicted`, we count it in `tx_list`?\n\nThat will give 3 wallet conflicts. Not that its important for assertion, because the third conflict is just asserted below this. But it did confused me for a moment in first pass why only 2 `walletconflicts`instead of 3.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23146#discussion_r721661904,721661904,test/functional/wallet_abandonconflict.py
jonatack,2021-10-05 09:50:36,"That would mean iterating through the (quite a bit longer) `tx_list`, and I only want to look through the conflicted transactions here to check them versus the double spend. Happy to look at a code proposal though.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23146#discussion_r722076218,722076218,test/functional/wallet_abandonconflict.py
rajarshimaitra,2021-10-05 19:57:35,"Ya I think that makes sense, we do need to iterate over a longer list then. Its not that important. It was a dumb confusion I had while reading. But the code is correct.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23146#discussion_r722613526,722613526,test/functional/wallet_abandonconflict.py
