jonasschnelli,2016-11-24T10:23:28Z,"Not sure. That's probably a matter of taste.\nThe thing why I'd like to keep the non-standard UI elements is, that I'm using a `QGraphicScene` at this point. Adding a `QWidget` (checkbox) at this point breaks the flexibility of reusing the `QGraphicScene` and draw it in any scale.\n\nI think the checkbox could be different then the one thats currently used.
