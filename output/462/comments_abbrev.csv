muggenhor,2011-08-11T22:33:50Z,By protocol.hpp I assume you mean to reject the extension? Changed that to protocol.h instead.\n\nThe copyright header I took from the head of another file now.\n\nAmmended and forced-updated these commits.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/462#issuecomment-1786662,1786662,
muggenhor,2011-08-11T22:35:32Z,"PS I was thinking it might be an even better idea to move every single message class to a single source/header file, e.g. src/protocol/$msg.(cpp|h). Any thoughts on that?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/462#issuecomment-1786675,1786675,
gavinandresen,2011-08-11T23:18:44Z,Separate source/header for each message wouldn't fit the rest of the project's 'style.' We've rejected other proposed re-orgs that did two-files-per-class.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/462#issuecomment-1786911,1786911,
muggenhor,2011-08-11T23:59:00Z,"Right, my intention was to move all classes related to the bitcoin wire protocol into protocol.(cpp|h). This to allow the actual transport (across a TCP socket, or something else if desired) to remain separated from protocol decoding/encoding and event handling (the latter is currently already split from networking and resides in main.cpp).\n\nSo no two-files-per-class-eritis.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/462#issuecomment-1787124,1787124,
