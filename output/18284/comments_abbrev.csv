MarcoFalke,2020-03-06 20:39:36,"> NOTE: This was addressed in master with a refactor (#18234), so this isn't a strict backport and needs full review.\n\nIf we fix this, I'd prefer to just backport that refactor",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18284#issuecomment-595955916,595955916,
ajtowns,2020-03-07 06:33:36,Backporting the refactor gets conflicts from the mockforward and uninterruptiblesleep patches at least -- I've had a go at https://github.com/ajtowns/bitcoin/commits/202003-scheduler-deboost-019 if anyone wants to look into it further. I think it's worth at least considering this much simpler approach if we want to improve 0.19 or earlier here. So Concept ACK I guess.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18284#issuecomment-596053358,596053358,
laanwj,2020-03-12 14:21:15,"I think this fix is pretty clear and minimal. Backporting complicated refactors sounds more risky.\nACK ed0223ec59e5e7941abf17afd17ede393abea31b",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18284#issuecomment-598213580,598213580,

MarcoFalke,2020-08-27 19:16:44,"I think both backporting the fix we did on master or coming up with a new fix are risky.\n\nTaking into account that this is not a regression with 0.19, that this doesn't happen on server, but only laptops (or machines that supsend/hibernate), it seems low risk to keep the bug as is.\n\nLaptop users might also be faster to upgrade to 0.20, where this is already fixed.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18284#issuecomment-682141494,682141494,

MarcoFalke,2020-08-27 20:08:52,"Though, it also has two ACKs, so it might be good.\n\nHas this been previously released in Knots and tested?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18284#issuecomment-682165515,682165515,
luke-jr,2020-08-27 22:42:40,"Yes, it was released in Knots 0.19.1.knots20200304, which had ~3 months before being replaced by 0.20.0. Not sure what it peaked at, but there's approx 25 nodes still running it today.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18284#issuecomment-682227187,682227187,
