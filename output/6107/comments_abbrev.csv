jonasschnelli,2015-05-05T13:01:23Z,Have to NACK because it would make the minimum width of the main window to 1090px (at least on OSX with lang=en). Either we search for a shorter string or much better we make sure there are line breaks (set a max-width for this widget).\n\nHere a screenshot with the mainwindow in min-width state:\n![bildschirmfoto-2015-05-05-um-14 53 56](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/178464/7472920/6f,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6107#issuecomment-99072413,99072413,

laanwj,2015-05-05T16:45:24Z,"I agree on the concept but I think we should put the longer warning somewhere else, for example in a notification area at the top of the overview page.  Replicating this extended warning two times on the overview screen is too much.

ddehueck,2015-05-05T17:06:09Z,"@laanwj I'm inclined to agree with you. I think a banner similar to the ""This is a pre-release test..."" one in jonasschnelli's screenshot above could better serve this warning. The warning banner could state something like, ""please allow a few days to synchronize if this is your first sync, otherwise please refer to the progress bar below.""

ddehueck,2015-05-05T19:29:25Z,@jonasschnelli @faizkhan00 I like the idea with the alert icon (probably a red icon) with a tool tip.
