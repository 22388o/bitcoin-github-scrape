jonasschnelli,2015-02-09T12:17:54Z,"ACK\n\nNext time i first would try to `git push --force` to your exiting PR branch (#5772). When there is a commit mess, just create a new local branch and overwrite the remote one by `git push --force <remote> localbranch:remotebranch` (or similar; not tested). This fixed my issues always.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5777#issuecomment-73499544,73499544,

ghost,2015-02-09T12:32:03Z,"@jonasschnelli I did a hard reset and then a force push, the reset wiped me back to the source master branch and the push made the server side repository think that I removed all of the commits which triggered the request closing. As far as I can tell, at that point it was game over short of the github admins getting involved as it wouldn't let me open with new commits.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5777#issuecomment-73501130,73501130,

laanwj,2015-02-18T11:58:19Z,"Also, as I asked before, but didn't get an answer: if we remove it from the about box, do we need to keep shape and position saving for the help message window? It doesn't seem necessary to me. I expect that the help message will be something that people occasionally open, not keep open during their session, so just popping it up in a sensible place would be good enough.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5777#issuecomment-74853050,74853050,

If it's an issue then I'll go in and try to undo it but since I apparently can't rebase to the current version without utterly breaking the PR, I'll have to do it by hand.\n\nIn regards to your question, sorry",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5777#issuecomment-74853732,74853732,
