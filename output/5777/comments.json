    "body": "@laanwj, the unrelated change is an artifact of going back to a different version of the file during my multiple attempts to undo the mess that became of this PR as well as the previous one. If it's an issue then I'll go in and try to undo it but since I apparently can't rebase to the current version without utterly breaking the PR, I'll have to do it by hand.\n\nIn regards to your question, sorry that you didn't get a reply, I didn't see the question before. My understanding, such as it is, is that this change will only affect the about window, not the help window.\n",
