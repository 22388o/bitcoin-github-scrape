rebroad,2016-08-24T12:34:18Z,"Actually, I think an attacker can manipulate this metric without performing useful work. It's quite trivial to for a node to send blocks invs to all its connected nodes as soon as it sees a block inv for a new block, and this can mean that many nodes see the block inv from this ""cheating"" node first since it didn't even need to start downloading the block before it was able to do this.
