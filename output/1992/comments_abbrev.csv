jgarzik,2012-11-08T19:40:09Z,How about checking the core thesis -- that memset is wholly optimized out -- before proceeding?\n\nI'm not sure gcc behaves this way.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1992#issuecomment-10201700,10201700,
Diapolo,2012-11-08T20:17:00Z,"Even if GCC would not do this, there is such a wide number of used GCC versions or other compilers used by people, who compile our client, that IMO it makes sense to follow such a hint: https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/cplusplus/MSC06-CPP.+Be+aware+of+compiler+optimization+when+dealing+with+sensitive+data\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1992#issuecomment-10203124,10203124,
laanwj,2012-11-08T20:17:49Z,"Not everyone is compiling with gcc, clang is also used, and maybe even MSVC. And if gcc is not doing this in the current version there is nothing preventing developers from adding it in a later version. \n\nAs it is known that some compilers optimize out memset in some cases, and there is no disadvantage to doing this,  I think this is a good precaution in any case.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1992#issuecomment-10203156,10203156,
