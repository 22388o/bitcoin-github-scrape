MarcoFalke,2020-05-09 19:25:21,"So for every new heavy task that is added to the scheduler we have to add one more thread to not degrade the worst case performance? Imagine the wallet is flushed on scheduler thread 1 and the dns is queried on scheduler thread 2. Both block for minutes, so a third scheduler thread is needed.

A trivial way to implement it is a second instance of a scheduler.\n\nBut we may want something smarter, like modifying the existing scheduler.
