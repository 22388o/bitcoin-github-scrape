jgarzik,2014-03-31T01:02:23Z,"Thank you Mr. Sarcasm.  We have already seen ""version"" screwups in the field.  The proposal has an engineering genesis.  And no, it would not be JSON.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3982#issuecomment-39046454,39046454,
davecgh,2014-03-31T01:46:42Z,"@jgarzik I do agree that the current method isn't the best, but nevertheless I think that it's important that so long as the code works the way it does, it treats the extension of the fields consistently.  Since this is what defines the protocol, it seems rather odd that three fields which were introduced with protocol version 106 are treated differently.\n\nI'm not sure if you were just talking i",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3982#issuecomment-39047746,39047746,

laanwj,2014-03-31T02:31:31Z,"It does look more consistent this way.\n\nHowever as sending `addrFrom` but not `nNonce` causes a parse error with all current clients, changing the 'protocol description' to be more permissive is deceptive.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3982#issuecomment-39049412,39049412,

sipa,2014-05-12T15:01:15Z,"I'm fine with improving the uniformity of how we deal with ""version""'s\noptional fields. We shouldn't continue that practice though.

jgarzik,2014-05-20T11:29:43Z,"Bringing the discussion back to the specific change at hand...  This change is IMO pointless.  ""weak NAK"" (ie. NAK/-1 but willing to be convinced otherwise)\n\nAll existing clients have a more strict definition, and there is no value in changing that so far down the stack of version information that is normally provided.

davecgh,2014-05-20T14:54:37Z,"As to the specific concerns about breaking existing clients, as @jgarzik notes, any client that implements anything greater than protocol version 106 (which is all of them) will necessarily require all of the fields.  Further, the client back in the protocol version 106 days will not break since it included all three fields as well thereby satisfying both the current inconsistent implementation an",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3982#issuecomment-43636701,43636701,

laanwj,2014-05-28T14:07:00Z,"Ok, consensus seems to be that this is unnecessary.\n\nAt some point when the minimum version is raised, we make all these fields required.
