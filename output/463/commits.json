The keys are encrypted with a master key\n+which is entirely random.  This master key is then encrypted with\n+AES-256-CBC with a key derived from the passphrase using SHA512 and\n+OpenSSL's EVP_BytesToKey and a dynamic number of rounds determined by\n+the speed of the machine which does the initial encryption (and is\n+updated based on the speed of a computer which does a subsequent\n+passphrase change).  Although the underlying code supports multiple\n+encrypted copies of the same master key (and thus multiple passphrases)\n+the client does not yet have a method to add additional passphrases.\n+\n+At runtime, the client loads the wallet as it normally would, however\n+the keystore stores the keys in encrypted form.  When the passphrase\n+is required (to top up keypool or send coins) it will either be queried\n+by a GUI prompt, or must first be entered with the walletpassphrase\n+RPC command.  This will change the wallet to \"unlocked\" state where the\n+unencrypted master key is stored in memory (in the case of GUI, only for\n+long enough to complete the requested operation, in RPC, for as long as\n+is specified by the second parameter to walletpassphrase).  The wallet is\n+then locked (or can be manually locked using the walletlock RPC command)\n+and the unencrypted master key is removed from memory.\n+\n+Implementation details of wallet encryption\n+-------------------------------------------\n+When the wallet is locked, calls to sendtoaddress, sendfrom, sendmany,\n+and keypoolrefill will return Error -13: \"Error: Please enter the wallet \n+passphrase with walletpassphrase first.\"\n+\n+When the wallet is unlocked, calls to walletpassphrase will fail.\n+\n+When a wallet is encrypted, the passphrase is required to top up the\n+keypool, thus, if the passphrase is rarely entered, it is possible that\n+keypool might run out.  In this case, the default key will be used as the\n+target for payouts for mining, and calls to getnewaddress and getaccount\n+address will return an error.  In order to prevent such cases, the keypool\n+is automatically refilled when walletpassphrase is called with a correct\n+passphrase and when topupkeypool is called (while the wallet is unlocked).\n+Note that the keypool continues to be topped up on various occasions when\n+a new key from pool is used and the wallet is unlocked (or unencrypted).\n+\n+\n+\n See the documentation at the bitcoin wiki:\n   https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Main_Page\n "
