promag,2018-02-16T11:02:30Z,"BTW, why not move `-logtimemicros` and `-debug*` to conf (all static parameters really)?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12443#discussion_r168728035,168728035,test/functional/test_framework/test_node.py
MarcoFalke,2018-02-23T17:24:57Z,"I think when you later spin up a node for debugging the datadir (block state, wallet state), you don't need to log micro time stamps. Also, I am not sure how the debug flags interfere when the conf sets `-debug` and the command line `-nodebug` ... Better leave it up for the user to set those explicitly, I think?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12443#discussion_r170313565,170313565,test/functional/test_framework/test_node.py
