ryanofsky,2017-02-16T16:32:04Z,I'd maybe make the comment more literal and say timestamp pruning will only prune blocks that are at least 2 hours older than the provided timestamp (instead of that timestamp pruning automatically adds a 2 hour buffer).,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9778#discussion_r101564395,101564395,src/rpc/blockchain.cpp
