TheBlueMatt,2017-09-04T20:12:09Z,Better to use our sync.h wrappers instead of std::* directly as our wrappers provide for DEBUG_LOCKORDER checks and will hopefully get automated clang locking checks on Travis soon (see commit https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/f01ea9326bc69d4f731a5904881740308c5e4271 in #10866).,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11199#issuecomment-327022839,327022839,
sipa,2017-09-04T21:04:53Z,"@TheBlueMatt I think that's an orthogonal improvement. There are some places in the codebase where sync.h wrappers are not used (either because nobody thought there was a deadlock risk, or because of performance concerns - sync.h uses recursive locks which are slower than unique locks).",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11199#issuecomment-327027966,327027966,
TheBlueMatt,2017-09-04T21:53:53Z,"@sipa indeed, though luckily the three places boost was switched to std here have no significant performance concerns, so easier to just switch them to sync.h wrappers over switching them to std directly. Generally we should be moving towards a ""sync strongly preferred unless you have a really good reason to use std directly"" model, though I know I've been guilty of not doing that in the past.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11199#issuecomment-327032385,327032385,
