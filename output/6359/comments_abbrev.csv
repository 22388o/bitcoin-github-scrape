theuni,2015-07-02T16:43:59Z,"@jtimon I'm not sure it's worth the complication of a factory here. Given that all chainparams and consensusparams are immutable, why not just pass around new instances when necessary? That should still be cheap, and much simpler? Especially given the trend to pass the params around as necessary rather than call Params() directly.\n\nSomething like:\n\n``` c++\nstatic CBaseChainParams::Network nCu",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6359#issuecomment-118089634,118089634,
jtimon,2015-07-02T19:22:46Z,"The main point of the factory is that it is not on globals/ because once we're finished ""passing chainparams around"" there should be no need for any global at all: You either take it as parameter or use the factory (this includes removing the SelectParams from `BasicTestingSetup::BasicTestingSetup()`, since nobody depends on the global and tests can use the factory directly).\n\nBut if copying the",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6359#issuecomment-118139777,118139777,
jtimon,2015-07-06T14:20:28Z,"@theuni I've been exploring your suggestion and it's not so straight-forward as you may think.\nIf Params(string) returns a new object instead of a reference some places will crash, like this one: \nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/test/alert_tests.cpp#L125\nIt also means that Params() and BaseParams() have to return a new object as well instead of a const reference.\nIt works fi",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6359#issuecomment-118870341,118870341,
