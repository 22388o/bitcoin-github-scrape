    "body": "I'm pretty sure this is actually triggerable exactly as 21E14 describes, e.g. when restarting a node which is had previously had an invalid block in the last execution.  It's easily triggerable with Pieter's invalidate block patch.\n\nThe fix given here does not appear to be sufficient as pindexBestForkBase is also dereferenced in the next block below, so I cannot ACK.  I would bludgeon Matt to clean the whole thing up, but he's travling and a minimal change for 0.10 would be preferable.\n\n21E14, can you please extend the guards so that all the deferences in this function are protected? I think that would be the simple and conservative move right now rather than trying to reason about what invarients hold for these globals. Having potential crash bugs for a corner case nag message isn't something that excites me.\n",
