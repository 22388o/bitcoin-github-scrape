MarcoFalke,2016-02-09T08:32:30Z,"> We could still round the value if desired.\n\nRight, but I can't see how this could be desired as this would imply we have integer precision on the estimation, which is not true.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7480#issuecomment-181758428,181758428,
laanwj,2016-02-09T10:06:01Z,Agree with @MarcoFalke that rounding gives the wrong idea here that we actually know what the precision of this estimate is.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7480#issuecomment-181794053,181794053,
