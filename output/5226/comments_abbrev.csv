laanwj,2014-11-07T10:12:21Z,"Instead of hardcoding 20 pixels it would be nice to get a suggested height for input widgets. Qt has various sizing settings (both on layout and widget level), are you sure it's not solvable with those alone?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5226#issuecomment-62122725,62122725,
jonasschnelli,2014-11-07T21:31:50Z,I tried different approaches but didn't succeed with setting constraints. Somehow the problem is that the QDialog should have a flexible height but as far as i see the QFormLayout does not stretch in height. And my QT knowhow is very limited.\n\nMaybe this solution is not the best but better then the current state (unusable password entry dialog).\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5226#issuecomment-62216513,62216513,
jonasschnelli,2014-11-20T08:29:09Z,It would be great if someone could review/test this because i think it would be good t have this in 0.10. Currently entering wallet encryption passphrase in OSX looks really bad.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5226#issuecomment-63775317,63775317,
laanwj,2014-11-20T10:16:50Z,"@jonasschnelli well I can merge it if it is an improvement, but I don't like absolute pixel sizes at all; people will have different font sizes, especially for accessibility reasons. This reeks of ""this fixes it in my specific setup so it should be OK"".\nThe window indeed behaves strangely (at least in Qt5). It's also resizable. Going to look into this.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5226#issuecomment-63787247,63787247,
laanwj,2014-11-20T10:29:58Z,"I isolated the root cause in `askpassphrasedialog.cpp`: \n\n``` c++\nui->warningLabel->setText(tr(""Enter the new passphrase to the wallet.<br/>Please use a passphrase of <b>ten or more random characters</b>, or <b>eight or more words</b>.""));\n```\n\nCommenting these out causes the window to behave normally. So maybe somehow Qt needs to be kicked after this to enforce sizing constraints again.\n\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5226#issuecomment-63788785,63788785,
laanwj,2014-11-20T11:34:06Z,"See #5320 for an attempt at a fix without hardcoding any values...  it's still ugly, but I wasn't able to solve it just with changing policies.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5226#issuecomment-63795803,63795803,
