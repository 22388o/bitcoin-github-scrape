petertodd,2013-07-29T02:11:25Z,"@sipa Actually bitcoind can spend any P2SH-encoded scriptPubKey that it knows how to spend, so you can (currently) put a pay-to-pubkey or a pay-to-pubkey-hash in redeemScript and things will work fine. In any case I think the feature of adding arbitrary redeemScripts makes the most sense in the context of watch-only-wallets where the actual mechanism to spend the coins can be handled elsewhere.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2830#issuecomment-21696294,21696294,
gmaxwell,2013-09-13T02:52:39Z,@petertodd  Can you remove addredeemscript for now since it seems like the watch stuff is currently delayed?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2830#issuecomment-24370141,24370141,
