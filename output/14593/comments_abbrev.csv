So I'd still suggest we explicitly disable this for now, and back-port to the 0.17.1 branch, so we don't continue to provide a broken UI (for ""Dark Mode"" users) there.\n\n![main](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/863730/47771365-efb1d800-dd1d-11e8-94e4-b97067655883.png)",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14593#issuecomment-434582986,434582986,
