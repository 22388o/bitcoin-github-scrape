sipa,2014-11-18T20:11:58Z,"@jgarzik what is the intended meaning of a block being relayed here?\n\nJust triggering on AcceptBlock isn't particularly interesting - it just means that it passes preliminary checks and is accepted into the block tree. I think the most interesting meaning is ""is accepted as new tip of the chain"", which already has a NotifyBlockTip signal.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5303#issuecomment-63536560,63536560,
theuni,2014-11-18T22:25:38Z,"@jgarzik note that the code wasn't actually compiled/tested by travis here because libzmq doesn't exist. In fact, the error handling in configure is broken. Libs like this usually default to ""auto"" or so, so that an explicit --enable-zmq would cause an error if the lib wasn't found.\n\nI commented in #5303 about adding the dependency, please have a look there.

amrali,2015-03-11T22:56:52Z,I think `ZMQ_SNDHWM` should be set here to configurable value (at least through configure.ac) this provides the option to the user on when to start dropping messages. the default value of zero means **a queue as large as the available memory** which is dangerous because networks could be slow or the production of messages is faster than the network I/O output -- a precursor to a memory overflow cr,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5303#discussion_r26264618,26264618,src/zmqports.cpp
amrali,2015-03-11T23:02:19Z,I think `zmq_ctx_term` should be used here instead if `ZMQ_LINGER` is to be set to some reasonable value to allow sending off what is possibly the last few queued messages (see my comment above the `zmq_bind` call). Not sure if this is desired or important to you.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5303#discussion_r26264945,26264945,src/zmqports.cpp
