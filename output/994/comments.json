I made bitcoind close the entire database environnement and create a new one when doing the rewrite, and it still blocks as soon as it tries to write a single value to the file. I have no idea what it is waiting for, but bdb calls pthread_cond_wait while there is only a single thread alive, which means a guaranteed deadlock.\n",
