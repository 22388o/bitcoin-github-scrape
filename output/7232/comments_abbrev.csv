MarcoFalke,2016-01-04T18:39:22Z,I don't understand this sentence. I like `(string) Expected number of hashes required to produce the current chain (in hex)` better.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7232#discussion_r48763215,48763215,src/rpcblockchain.cpp
instagibbs,2016-01-04T19:25:30Z,"What don't you understand about it specifically? Would:  \n\n> (string) Expected number of hashes required to produce the chain up to this block (in hex)  \n\nbe better? As-is it's ambiguous to what ""current chain"" means. In getblockchaininfo it clearly means the valid chain with most work.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7232#discussion_r48769375,48769375,src/rpcblockchain.cpp
MarcoFalke,2016-01-04T20:48:44Z,"> block header hashes\n\nis not immediately clear what this means. Usually blocks with hashes that don't hit the diff are not considered valid, so they are not counted. Then ""estimated"" gives the hint that they are counted as well.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7232#discussion_r48779242,48779242,src/rpcblockchain.cpp
MarcoFalke,2016-01-04T20:49:05Z,@instagibbs I like your suggestion as well.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7232#discussion_r48779265,48779265,src/rpcblockchain.cpp
