molxyz,2018-10-19T17:36:25Z,"@hebasto  This screen is for ""About Bitcoin Core"", so I would like to have it kept as clean and professional looking as possible.  There's a screen for ""About Qt"" under `Help` that you might want to look at? Although I still don't see the purpose for this.  Please do not keep trying to change trivial, unnecessary things for Bitcoin Core, it's just a waste of devs time for more important improvemen",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14521#issuecomment-431440157,431440157,
merland,2018-10-23T13:50:42Z,"@molxyz \nRegarding your comment about changing ""trivial"" things: Isn't that a very good way for newcomers to get used to the contribution process and learn the way around the docs and the code? I certainly think so. \nAnd in the process, Bitcoin Core gets many small improvements in areas where more experienced devs rarely work. It's a win-win!  \n\nIf ""trivial"" PRs take too much time for devs",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14521#issuecomment-432255059,432255059,
