hebasto,2020-05-02 00:40:02,This change adds log entry if `nLoaded == 0`. Is it intentional?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18786#discussion_r418794352,418794352,src/validation.cpp
hebasto,2020-05-02 01:02:18,Shouldn't this block be outside of the `if ... else ...` statement?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18786#discussion_r418804507,418804507,src/init.cpp
MarcoFalke,2020-05-02 18:30:45,"Yes. `LoadExternalBlockFile` is only called when files are actually read. If `nLoaded` is zero, something has gone wrong and we should be verbose about that.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18786#discussion_r418991954,418991954,src/validation.cpp
MarcoFalke,2020-05-02 18:37:22,"why? That would be a slight behaviour change. Previously, we'd also loop over invalid files until the first valid file is found and then check for interruption. I don't think it matters much in any case.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18786#discussion_r418992667,418992667,src/init.cpp
