JeremyRubin,2017-02-26T20:49:34Z,"What if someone is trying to learn something and uses one of the documentation addresses  and gets ""invalid address"" and thinks something is wrong with their node/service? I think I prefer having a valid address in documentation for this reason.\n\nMy proposal to fix it would be that it uses an address that is owned by the wallet in question (specifically marked for help output), if the node has",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9865#issuecomment-282586270,282586270,
laanwj,2017-02-27T09:15:57Z,"I strongly prefer using an invalid address here. You are not supposed to copy/paste the address, it can happen and it's better if it fails. Prevents a lot of panic ""where did I just send to"".\n\nUsing an address from the current wallet is a fair suggestion, but many of these calls are not coupled to the wallet at all, and shouldn't be.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9865#issuecomment-282666412,282666412,

marijnfs,2017-02-26T19:23:30Z,"Interesting. Though, I wanted to make the minimal change possible (I changed one letter) to keep things simpler.
