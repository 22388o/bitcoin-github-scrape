gmaxwell,2014-07-16T04:56:16Z,huh?  Now it will spam the threshold exceeded on a whitelisted peer that doesn't get banned.\n\nAFAICT there is no bug here either: \nmisbehaving = 0 \nhowmuch = 1000\nmisbehaving += howmuch\n(1000 >= 100 && 1000 - 1000 < 100)  is true.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4543#issuecomment-49123651,49123651,
