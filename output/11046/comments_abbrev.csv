theuni,2017-08-17T04:02:14Z,"Yes, we can't do this just yet. This would make MilliSleep non-interruptible, meaning that a few threads (see upnp for an easy example) would hang around for several minutes before dying.\n\nDue to the renewed interest (see #10923) as well, I'll finish up the std thread/mutex/condvar conversion asap so that we can proceed with changes like these.
