But if all of that needs to become a separately-maintained library first, then I don't think it should be a blocker for this PR.\n\nI do not believe that protecting against broken OSes should be a priority for us. In general, OSses are in a much better position to provide an RNG than we are. If the OS RNG is broken, generally all bets are off, including remote access to your system. It's a worthwhile goal to provide a best effort security in that case, but not if it comes at the cost of extra maintenance work that this project isn't willing to take on.",

    "body": "I thought about that too, though I believe the counter would allow us to make stronger proofs about the cycle length of the function while relying on much less strong assumptions about the behavior of the hash-- similar to how fortuna uses a permutation in order to make _very_ strong proofs about the cycle length.  I suppose we could always change it later if someone wants to do the formal work to verify it. \r\n\r\nThe fact that it has compromise resistance (by new entropy constantly being added in the form of time/stack pointer/os entropy) means the cycle length is probably not much of a concern.  Without that, then there would be weak seeds, though they'd be cryptographically hard to find, where the RNG output would have short cycles (the frequency of short cycles in random functions is surprisingly high)-- and these would be eliminated by a counter unless you allowed a really implausible hash function.\r\n",
