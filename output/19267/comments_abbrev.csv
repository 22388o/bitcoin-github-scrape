I kept the three gitian-mimic configs at bionic (win64, mac, and the C++17 linux build). Though, sanitizers are not supported by gitian, so I think requiring them to use the older LTS and patch them with workarounds might not be the best way",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19267#issuecomment-643758587,643758587,
