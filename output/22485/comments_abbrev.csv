MarcoFalke,2021-07-19 08:52:23,"What do you mean with ""until the next restart""? Once the index is in sync with the active chain tip, it will stay that way, regardless of restarts. The only way it could get out of sync is when you disable the index on a restart, advance the tip, then enable it again.
