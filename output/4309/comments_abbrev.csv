pstratem,2014-06-08T23:38:56Z,This effectively reduces duplicate calls to CTransaction::GetHash() to zero.\n\nThere are a few duplicates but I believe those to be the coinbase transactions which are actually identical.\n\nI have not reviewed for correctness.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4309#issuecomment-45452060,45452060,
pstratem,2014-06-08T23:43:13Z,Actually those appear to be something to do with the genesis block.\n\nEither way it's a trivial number of duplicate calls.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4309#issuecomment-45452156,45452156,

As a grep of all CMutableTransaction uses helpfully highlights, there is never a case where a TX is accessed in parallel or stored in a parallel-access container while also being mutated.\n\nAs such, you may apply the common ""I'm done mutating this data structure, update cached data"" pattern without needing a new class.\n\nETA: I'm posting this on a closed issue bec",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4309#issuecomment-46926512,46926512,
