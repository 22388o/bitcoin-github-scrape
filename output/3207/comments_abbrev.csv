gavinandresen,2013-11-06T04:47:19Z,"The wallet stores both ""from"" and ""to"" transactions, so storing both ""from"" and ""to"" payment requests makes sense to me (I believe we're storing neither right now).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3207#issuecomment-27842886,27842886,
laanwj,2013-11-06T07:30:39Z,"@sipa I guess it could be stored in the wallet, but that means there will need to be a core interface for storing arbitrary data (that the core doesn't know the format of) in the wallet.\n\n@gavinandresen Yes, storing incoming payment requests would make sense too, and could be done in a similar way but somewhere else in the UI\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3207#issuecomment-27847653,27847653,
laanwj,2013-11-06T11:10:56Z,"@gavinandresen Thinking about it, we should store _incoming_ payment requests in the transaction metadata and simply show them in the transactions list. \nWe can't do the same for _outgoing_ payment requests at least until the recipient pays them, maybe they could be correlated and stored in the transaction list then, but until the request is paid it must be in this separate list.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3207#issuecomment-27864089,27864089,
