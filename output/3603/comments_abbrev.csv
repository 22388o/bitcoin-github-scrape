laanwj,2014-01-31T07:42:57Z,"This was not introduced in this pull but we really shouldn't be using `int` for file sizes but `off_t` for compatibility with 64 bit files (sure, if the address database is more than 2GB I'd be afraid as well... but having negative values here due to wraparound can cause bad stuff).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3603#discussion_r9335967,9335967,src/net.cpp

laanwj,2014-01-31T08:23:15Z,"`boost::uintmax_t` sounds like overkill. This is the largest integer type supported on the architecture. This may be 128 bit on some systems. \nYou shouldn't blindly switch to an unsigned type here. This will break things, see `if ( dataSize < 0 ) dataSize = 0;`  below.\n\n`int64_t` would be possible, but `off_t` is the official type for this in C, and sizes according to the size of file offsets i",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3603#discussion_r9336307,9336307,src/net.cpp
laanwj,2014-02-10T08:28:14Z,No need to cast to int here. The comparison is valid either way.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3603#discussion_r9576458,9576458,src/util.cpp
Diapolo,2014-02-10T15:34:55Z,Removed the cast in both cases...\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3603#discussion_r9587556,9587556,src/util.cpp
