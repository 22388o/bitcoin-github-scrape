laanwj,2016-07-21T10:00:07Z,Tend to agree with @jtimon. I think it was removed in other places where information was migrated to the debug message.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8341#discussion_r71678496,71678496,src/main.cpp
sipa,2016-07-21T10:58:31Z,"Agree with removing. I don't think function names are very useful to most debug.log readers, and to those that are, you can just grep the source code for the message. Though perhaps we should do a combined effort of fixing it everywhere. ACK with or without **func**\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8341#discussion_r71685332,71685332,src/main.cpp
