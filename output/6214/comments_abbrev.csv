theuni,2015-06-02T13:53:16Z,"Glad this actually worked!\n\nWhat's the reason for not just adding Base.lproj/InfoPlist.strings in git, though?

jonasschnelli,2015-06-02T14:09:21Z,The nice thing with faking the file during the make process is that we not add another file containing a static string for the application name.
