        "patch": "@@ -0,0 +1,88 @@\n+Bitcoin Core version 0.16.3 is now available from:\n+\n+  <https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-0.16.3/>\n+\n+This is a new minor version release, with various bugfixes.\n+\n+Please report bugs using the issue tracker at GitHub:\n+\n+  <https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues>\n+\n+To receive security and update notifications, please subscribe to:\n+\n+  <https://bitcoincore.org/en/list/announcements/join/>\n+\n+How to Upgrade\n+==============\n+\n+If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely\n+shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the\n+installer (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt` (on Mac)\n+or `bitcoind`/`bitcoin-qt` (on Linux).\n+\n+The first time you run version 0.15.0 or newer, your chainstate database will be converted to a\n+new format, which will take anywhere from a few minutes to half an hour,\n+depending on the speed of your machine.\n+\n+Note that the block database format also changed in version 0.8.0 and there is no\n+automatic upgrade code from before version 0.8 to version 0.15.0 or higher. Upgrading\n+directly from 0.7.x and earlier without re-downloading the blockchain is not supported.\n+However, as usual, old wallet versions are still supported.\n+\n+Downgrading warning\n+-------------------\n+\n+Wallets created in 0.16 and later are not compatible with versions prior to 0.16\n+and will not work if you try to use newly created wallets in older versions. Existing\n+wallets that were created with older versions are not affected by this.\n+\n+Compatibility\n+==============\n+\n+Bitcoin Core is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using\n+the Linux kernel, macOS 10.8+, and Windows Vista and later. Windows XP is not supported.\n+\n+Bitcoin Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not\n+frequently tested on them.\n+\n+Notable changes\n+===============\n+\n+Denial-of-Service vulnerability\n+-------------------------------\n+\n+A denial-of-service vulnerability (CVE-2018-17144) exploitable by miners has\n+been discovered in Bitcoin Core versions 0.14.0 up to 0.16.2. It is recommended\n+to upgrade any of the vulnerable versions to 0.16.3 as soon as possible.\n+\n+0.16.3 change log\n+------------------\n+\n+### Consensus\n+- #14249 `696b936` Fix crash bug with duplicate inputs within a transaction (TheBlueMatt, sdaftuar)\n+\n+### RPC and other APIs\n+- #13547 `212ef1f` Make `signrawtransaction*` give an error when amount is needed but missing (ajtowns)\n+\n+### Miscellaneous\n+- #13655 `1cdbea7` bitcoinconsensus: invalid flags error should be set to `bitcoinconsensus_err` (afk11)\n+\n+### Documentation\n+- #13844 `11b9dbb` correct the help output for -prune (hebasto)\n+\n+Credits\n+=======\n+\n+Thanks to everyone who directly contributed to this release:\n+\n+- Anthony Towns\n+- Hennadii Stepanov\n+- Matt Corallo\n+- Suhas Daftuar\n+- Thomas Kerin\n+- Wladimir J. van der Laan\n+\n+And to those that reported security issues:\n+\n+- (anonymous reporter)\n+"
