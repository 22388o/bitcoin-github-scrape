petertodd,2013-08-29T17:37:17Z,"@luke-jr Good idea, although I won't make it a <= test, not a == test.\n\nActually, no, I'm going to take that back: app developers are just going to call sendrawtransaction with their nFees, which is likely to be calculated wrong anyway...

DannyHamilton,2013-09-16T09:26:02Z,"Sanity testing on fees would certainly have helped me.  I've been using sendrawtransaction in a variety of circumstances for 5 months now.  I was pretty confident with the raw transaction tools, and (until today) had created over 200 transactions without any issues.  Then while creating a raw transaction today, I accidentally included vout=0 when I intended to include vout=1 in the input.
