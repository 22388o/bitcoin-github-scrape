As far as I can see, this doesn't make Bitcoin Core incompatible with the BIP - it's just choosing in some cases to not opt into an optional feature (based on a heuristic to guess that the other side doesn't understand it anyway). If clients on the network appear that want BIP155 but somehow don't want to increment the protocol version, that would be a good reason to revert this.",
