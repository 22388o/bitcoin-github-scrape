MarcoFalke,2020-12-30 09:06:27,"Keeping it will create spurious incompatibilities with to-be-deployed software that implements according to the BIP. If the goal is to keep this workaround permanently, it might be good to propose an update to the BIP first. I don't want to decide what the BIP should say, but I think that Bitcoin Core should generally follow the BIP specification.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20800#issuecomment-752383138,752383138,

We can live with this exception to the BIP for a couple of years and then revert.\n\n> Please don't merge until the above mentioned software projects issues a release.\n\nWe should wait some time _after_ they issue a release. There may be unupgraded nodes from those projects for some time. Probably not many, but we should avoid breaking compatibility ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20800#issuecomment-753599731,753599731,

sipa,2021-01-03 18:34:49,"@MarcoFalke My thinking here was that it could also wait a few years, depending on network developments. As far as I can see, this doesn't make Bitcoin Core incompatible with the BIP - it's just choosing in some cases to not opt into an optional feature (based on a heuristic to guess that the other side doesn't understand it anyway). If clients on the network appear that want BIP155 but somehow do",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20800#issuecomment-753658551,753658551,
