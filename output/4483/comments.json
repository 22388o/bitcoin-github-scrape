    "body": "Looks mostly OK.  I readily admit my python, like my JavaScript and C++, looks like it was written by a C coder.\n\n\"Whoever created this file used tabs instead of spaces, which is very inconvenient to anyone that needs to edit this.\" is always met with a snort, because the reverse is true.  Tabs enables custom indentation, spaces do not.  Furthermore, after much reading of various python code from various authors, it is apparent that the Linus maxim continues to be true:  8-space-sized tabs lead to more readable code, because it forces the programmer to break up their code into small, readable units that just do one thing.\n\nPEP8 is no defense against the widespread \"death before helper function\" practice, in the python-writing bitcoin community at least, where 200 line, 200 column methods are the norm.\n\nBut it is not your fault that the python community are anti-productive blockheads in this regard, so the likely course is to accept PEP8 with all its idiocy (and these changes).\n",
