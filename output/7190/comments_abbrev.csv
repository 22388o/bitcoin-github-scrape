morcos,2015-12-09T11:17:11Z,"Any tx that has been in your mempool for longer than 10 blocks will have to be recalculated from scratch during a reorg.  In addition any transaction which entered your mempool more recently than the reorg depth will have to recalculated, so you will always have to recalculate at least the txs that came in since the last blcok.\n\nI think if we are going to try to make reorgs fast, we should do it",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7190#issuecomment-163191892,163191892,
NicolasDorier,2015-12-09T14:40:47Z,"We could potentially scan the whole header chain instead of only 10, but I don't think this is a good idea performance wise. I think this is better to only scan 10 and just recalculate locktime if it is more, rather than wasting time scanning to the genesis. I can change that though if you think it is indeed faster to scan to genesis. MempoolEntry older than 10 blocks are rather rare I would expec",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7190#issuecomment-163266565,163266565,
morcos,2015-12-09T14:52:48Z,"Yes that is my point.\nHowever with the solution in #7187 it will not be necessary to relook up the inputs to the the tx and recalculate the sequence locks unless any of the inputs to the tx were in that most recent block, which seems likely to be considerably rarer.  \nTechnically if its a 1 block reorg, the blockTime won't have changed (with MTP) but I'm not suggesting not rechecking that.

After a reorg, the ""birthdate"" of the inputs may have changed, and so, the minimum time/height (what you call LockPoint) to satisfy as well.

jtimon,2015-12-11T16:37:29Z,"I'm having troubles understanding what is wrong with this solution for #7176. It is very nice that it doesn't have to touch the 6-months old (and already  reviewed) consensus code (#6312) further, and I think that makes it the less risky and less development-resources-wasteful option for #7176.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7190#issuecomment-163985157,163985157,
NicolasDorier,2015-12-12T10:52:28Z,"I agree, with jtimon. What is wrong with this code is the I recheck more than I need to.\nIn this code, if there is a 1 block reorg (block A replaced by block B), then all mempool transaction which came after BlockA will need to be rechecked.
