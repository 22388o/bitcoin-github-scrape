    "body": "We could potentially scan the whole header chain instead of only 10, but I don't think this is a good idea performance wise. I think this is better to only scan 10 and just recalculate locktime if it is more, rather than wasting time scanning to the genesis. I can change that though if you think it is indeed faster to scan to genesis. MempoolEntry older than 10 blocks are rather rare I would expect.\n\n>  In addition any transaction which entered your mempool more recently than the reorg depth will have to recalculated, so you will always have to recalculate at least the txs that came in since the last blcok.\n\nI don't understand your point.\nImagine tip = Block A, the tx1 comes in mempool. Then a reorg happens that replace BlockA with BlockB then tx1 will have, as expected, locktime invalidated.\nThis must be done, and can't be optimized, because the blockTime in LockTime(), MTP or not, will have changed.\n\nIf I understand your point : yes, during a reorg, all transaction which came since the last block will be invalidated, and they should be.\n",

    "body": "Yes that is my point.\nHowever with the solution in #7187 it will not be necessary to relook up the inputs to the the tx and recalculate the sequence locks unless any of the inputs to the tx were in that most recent block, which seems likely to be considerably rarer.  \nTechnically if its a 1 block reorg, the blockTime won't have changed (with MTP) but I'm not suggesting not rechecking that.  I'm just saying you don't have to recalculate the time/height at which the sequence locks are valid which is the expensive part.\nWith your solution I think you will still be recalculating sequence locks for a significant fraction of the mempool on a reorg which is slow and destroys your utxo cache.\n",
