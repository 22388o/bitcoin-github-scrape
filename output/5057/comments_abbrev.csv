laanwj,2014-10-08T06:40:47Z,"Hmm thinking about it I'm not sure early termination (f08c863) is safe given restarts:\n- Bitcoind given the stop command while reindexing, it has just processed block A and is now processing earlier child blocks of that B, C and D. It stops after B.\n- On the re-run, it will encounter B again and skip it (already known), and C and D again and put them in mapBlocksUnknownParent. So far so good.\n-",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5057#issuecomment-58316716,58316716,
