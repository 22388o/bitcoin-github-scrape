    "body": "That's just not true regarding derivative works. Bitcoin links against e.g. boost and is not a derivative of boost.  Its header files are distributed separately.  It's easy to specify specific versions of external dependencies.\n\nVerifying correctness of database operation is not a trust model change.  I'm thinking of it mostly in an advisory capacity...to notify node operators that something has gone horribly wrong.  Note that the UTXO commitment scheme I describe doesn't actually require those hashes to be committed to in a block.  Nodes can locally compute them simply to verify their own correctness of operation (and not communicate them at all). So one has potentially 3 sources of these hashes: computed during block ingest, computed by database query, and committed in the block.  Nodes that detect such an error could e.g. refuse to mine blocks (at the discretion of the operator -- obviously blindly trusting the hash in the block IS a trust model change).\n",
