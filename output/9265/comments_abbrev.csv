laanwj,2016-12-02T11:35:20Z,I'm not aware of any way of getting the underlying error OS error code from\nlibevent. The one shown is libevent http error and every network layer\nerror will basically get -1. But feel free to suggest a way.\n\nThe other alternative would be to revert #9073 and leave it at that.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9265#issuecomment-264435287,264435287,
