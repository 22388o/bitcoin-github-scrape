    "body": "I'm glad to see someone working on this!\r\n\r\nOne prior proposal was to put _all_ inbound into one timing bucket, and keep per-peer timing for each outbound with the rationale that the attacker doesn't control our outbounds but could potentially control any inbounds.\r\n\r\nIf we found that to be too slow we could quantize inbound network groups into a small number of buckets (e.g. 4, by computing  hasher(seed, netgroup)&3 or similar) and have timers per that so even when an attacker goes and gets a lot of groups his speedup has a small bound\r\n\r\nI think probably we shouldn't be too afraid of slowing down propagation-- the changes to add delays at all were a massive slowdown and generated basically no notice.\r\n\r\nAlso related to this we might want to track the rate of novel transactions being accepted for a particular peer and up-delay really slow peers (like send every Nth time it would otherwise send).  The rational being that relay of novel transactions blinds tracking (since we won't relay something a peer gave to us back to them) and also lazy tracking stuff tends not to relay anything.   Delaying tx relay to a peer that never sends anything would hardly hurt propagation in the network, but at least might force attackers to be a bit more useful.\r\n",

Giving different peers a synchronized timer results increases bandwidth spikes, which isn't so much a concern for tx propagation, but may interfere with block propagation if they coincide. For outgoing peers (max 16) this is not that much of a concern, but then again, due to the previous point, synchronizing things is also less useful there.\r\n\r\nRegarding @gmaxwell's point of memory exhaustion, we could introduce a per-group reference counter, and delete the corresponding map entries when no peers in that group remain?",

If all sends happen at once, when the attacker sees a transaction happen from X first then he can have some confidence that transactions happened from there.   If the send times are independent and the attacker sees a transaction from X first he doesn't learn that much from that transaction.\r\n\r\nThe issue becomes if the attacker connects to you 20 times and the times are independent than he gets effectively a 20th of the delay.

    "body": "I've been looking at this paper \"Deanonymization in the Bitcoin P2P Network\" (https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6735-deanonymization-in-the-bitcoin-p2p-network.pdf).  It's got some ideas for how to think about an adversary's strategies with respect to detecting the first node on a network to relay a new transaction.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me there are a couple different kinds of adversaries to consider -- (a) one that makes only inbound connections to listening nodes on the network, versus (b) one that manages to take over some percentage of listening nodes and thus controls x% of the outbound connections on the network.  (And then these could be combined of course.)\r\n\r\nFor type (a) adversaries, there are multiple types of strategies that could be employed to deanonymize the first listening node to relay a transaction.  Perhaps the simplest strategy is the \"first spy\" estimator described in that paper, where the adversary estimates the first node to relay a transaction to it as the source.  Such a strategy seems to be very successful if the adversary connects to each node on the network multiple times, and this PR would mitigate that.  However, based on simulations I've done, I think 8 buckets is too many.  I don't have a sense for how easy it is for an adversary to actually connect from different network groups to achieve the 8 different timings -- so if we decide that is suitably hard, then maybe the point I'm raising is moot -- but if we assume that is achievable, then my simulations suggest a 40% success rate for a first-spy adversary.\r\n\r\nThe paper I mentioned above goes into some length discussing the success bounds of an attacker that is smarter than that and also uses knowledge of the network graph to estimate the source node.  I am still working through simulations that demonstrate the ideas they suggest, but I think I have a rough maximum-likelihood estimator that appears to be -- very roughly -- 15-20% successful at estimating the source node based on the times at which the adversary sees announcements from each node in the network.  This is assuming that the adversary has 1 inbound connection to each node on the network.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that as a first pass, we might limit the number of buckets so that the effectiveness of a first-spy adversary is on par with that of a smarter adversary[1].  From my analysis so far, I think having 2 buckets for incoming peers would roughly achieve that, with the important caveats that (a) no one has sanity checked my sim results [2], and (b) I don't know yet how good the maximum-likelihood estimator could be if it were smart enough to use 2 connections to each peer.\r\n\r\nIf we weren't concerned about tradeoffs (ie bandwidth spikes or relay propagation delays), I'd say we could just make this all one bucket for inbound peers, to maximize source-privacy in our current transaction relay model.\r\n\r\n------\r\n[1] I think we could also go further and figure out some equilibrium with respect to an adversary controlling X% of the listening nodes/outbound connections on the network, but I'm not sure how to think about the relative costs of these kinds of adversarial approaches.\r\n\r\n[2] If anyone is able to do their own simulations or estimations to corroborate my observations that would be fantastic.",

Even if we got a bit smarter and put in some prefixes of major VPS providers to be treated as a single group (or one per provider), it's still not terrible hard to get on lots of networks... there are even commercial services that give you addresses in as many /8s as possible for the purpose of jamming the bittorrent DHT stuff for 'anti-piracy' reasons.\r\n\r\nWe should generally assume that network group limitations are a pretty modest roadbump.

    "body": "I've been doing some more simulations on this recently.  I still don't have good results for the graph-aware estimators that (in theory) should be pretty powerful.  But I did want to share a couple other results on the first spy estimator:\r\n\r\nFirst my previously reported simulations were more optimistic than I realized, because I was just modeling the effect of limiting the number of connections an adversary could make, without taking into account the delay in propagation across the network that occurs when we bin the inbound peers.  So for instance I previously modeled how well an attacker would do if we limited them to 8 connections per peer, without also modeling the effect on the network due to ALL inbound peers being in those buckets as well.\r\n\r\nSlowing down transaction relay across the network benefits the first-spy estimator (as it increases their window of success).  So I fixed that deficiency in my latest simulation, and I observed that bucketing the inbound peers to 8 buckets -- and assuming that the adversary is in all 8 buckets for all nodes on the network -- appears to give a success rate to the attacker of ~54% (!).\r\n\r\nI did my simulations on randomly generated graphs on 5000 nodes, where each node randomly picked 8 outbound peers.  I assume the adversary is connected in every available inbound bucket.  This uses the existing relay delays we have for inbound peers (2x the mean delay of our outbound peers).  For each row in the table, I ran 2000 simulations.\r\n\r\n| Number of inbound buckets  | Success rate |\r\n| ------------- | ------------- |\r\n| 1  | 19%  |\r\n| 2  | 26%  |\r\n| 3 | 34% |\r\n| 4 | 41% |\r\n| 5 | 46% |\r\n| 6 | 50% |\r\n| 7 | 53% |\r\n| 8 | 54% |\r\n\r\nI also simulated @gmaxwell's suggested strategy, of using 4 inbound buckets, but applying a bigger (4x instead of 2x) delay to inbound peers.  That had a first-spy estimator success rate of 28%.\r\n\r\nI'll update these results with some statistics about total propagation times soon...",

    "body": "Here are my results on spikes.\r\n\r\n### Meta\r\n\r\nThe graph represents the distribution of times when a random public-IP node in the network sends INVs to its peers.\r\n\r\nI used 1 tx/s for simulation (to get real bandwidth numbers below I believe we should multiply by 3 as this would be closer to the current tx rate, the bandwidth numbers presented in this message are already multiplied by 3), 5000 transactions for each run, the ratio of public IP nodes to private IP nodes in the network is 1 to 10 (which is kinda similar to the current one).\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\n\r\n![Distributions](https://github.com/naumenkogs/Bitcoin-Simulator/blob/delays_per_net_group/distribution_measurements/distribution_graphs.jpeg?raw=true)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI guess what is important is the tail of the distribution \u2013 the probability of huge number of transactions being relayed within one interval of 5 seconds.\r\nI won't say anything about buckets > 2, because my results show that anonymity properties are weak there. I'd say, once we have more nodes in the network and having connections to 100% of nodes will be harder to achieve, we may consider buckets > 2.\r\n\r\nif we choose 1 bucket, r=2 is better because it is less spikey and the success rate is the same. If we are OK with eventual spikes of 18 KB/s, we should do 1 bucket and r=2.\r\n\r\nIf we compare 2-bucket results, the distribution is slightly better for r=2, while anonymity is better for r=4 (5% better). I think r=4 is better here (keep in mind though that it introduces 25-40% propagation delay according to my measurements). The eventual spikes here are 14 KB/s.\r\nObviously, r=3 would be something in the middle, I may do additional runs for that scenario, I'm not adding it here to avoid confusion.\r\n\r\nPlease share your thoughts.\r\n\r\nUpd:\r\nRaw data and more graphs (buckets > 2) are available [here](https://github.com/naumenkogs/Bitcoin-Simulator/tree/delays_per_net_group/distribution_measurements).\r\n",

You can see precise results now. 1 bucket comparing to 8 is 20-25% worse for 50% coverage, and 5-10% worse for 100% coverage. \r\n\r\nAt the same time, making R=4 itself has an impact around 80% comparing to R=2. That's why I'm arguing for R=2 and 1 bucket (if we allow those spikes of 18 KB/s).\r\n\r\nWhat is still surprising for me (and for some other people) is: with R=1 setting buckets to 1 is *slightly less significant* than doing the same with R=4 \u2014\u00a0see \"max slowdown\". We expected it to be *more significant*, because we expected that with R=1 nature of relay through incoming should matter more. Also be aware that **absolute** *max slowdown* is fairly low \u2014\u00a0up to 2 seconds.\r\n\r\nI've briefly seen some graphs of @sdaftuar and it was something similar to what I've had \u2014\u00a0the same surprise.",
