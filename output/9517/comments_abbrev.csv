dcousens,2017-01-11T14:09:13Z,why the manual release?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9517#discussion_r95584113,95584113,src/httpserver.cpp
kallewoof,2017-01-11T14:13:51Z,Because `eventBase`/`eventHTTP` are global and need them intact. If I don't release they'd be deleted on function return.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9517#discussion_r95584953,95584953,src/httpserver.cpp
dcousens,2017-01-11T14:17:53Z,~~What happened to the error handling?~~ (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/support/events.h#L33),https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9517#discussion_r95585717,95585717,src/httpserver.cpp
dcousens,2017-01-11T14:18:43Z,"I mean,  I guess it improves consistency, and the `.release()`,  if you added a comment noting the above about the lifetime,  might be clearer than what was there before?\n\nThis change seems pointless IMHO,  maybe I'm missing something",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9517#discussion_r95585863,95585863,src/httpserver.cpp
kallewoof,2017-01-11T14:23:59Z,"Yeah, you're right. Addressing.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9517#discussion_r95586891,95586891,src/httpserver.cpp
kallewoof,2017-01-11T14:24:37Z,"In the case of event_base, the wrapper does the error handling already.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9517#discussion_r95587003,95587003,src/httpserver.cpp
kallewoof,2017-01-11T14:30:26Z,"Regarding purpose: the one thing this brings is that no matter how things end, the base and http objects will be properly cleaned up. I have no idea what kind of side-effects an initialized and forgotten event base or evhttp might have. Perhaps none whatsoever.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9517#discussion_r95588216,95588216,src/httpserver.cpp
laanwj,2017-01-19T14:10:30Z,"What about\n```\neventBase = base_ctr.release();\neventHTTP = http_ctr.release();\n```",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9517#discussion_r96866256,96866256,src/httpserver.cpp
kallewoof,2017-01-19T14:42:10Z,That looks much better. I didn't realize you could do that. Thanks!,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9517#discussion_r96872954,96872954,src/httpserver.cpp
