theuni,2016-03-01T17:13:07Z,"Why free/create every time the event is set? They're reusable.\nHow about just event_new in the ctor, event_free in the dtor, and event_add as needed?\n\nEdit: The naming may be confusing to those unfamiliar with libevent. event_new allocates, event_add schedules a new event, event_del un-schedules if not yet run, event_free deallocates. I suggest just making it RAII-like.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7610#issuecomment-190818897,190818897,
