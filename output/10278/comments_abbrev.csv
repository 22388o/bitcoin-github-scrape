jimmysong,2017-04-25T14:29:09Z,Please let me know if this is too basic a unit test. I'm using unit test writing as a way to get familiar with the code base.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10278#issuecomment-297048275,297048275,
laanwj,2017-04-25T16:03:58Z,"This tests only one code path of `GetListenPort`. Possibly this could be extended with a test for the `-port` argument as well, e.g. temporarily set the option to something else and see if the returned value changes to that.\n\nAnyhow, thanks for adding a test.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10278#issuecomment-297079484,297079484,
laanwj,2017-04-25T16:05:13Z,Also might make sense to compare against `Params().GetDefaultPort()` instead of hardcoding the number.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10278#issuecomment-297079864,297079864,
jimmysong,2017-04-25T17:17:41Z,"Thanks for the review @laanwj, I've changed the test per your suggestions and squashed.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10278#issuecomment-297102259,297102259,
MarcoFalke,2017-05-09T11:13:00Z,"This will modify the global state of test run after this test case. There are other places in the test code where this already happens, but imo, unit tests should really be unit test.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10278#discussion_r115463190,115463190,src/test/net_tests.cpp
jimmysong,2017-05-09T13:53:15Z,"Thanks for the feedback!\n\nWhat should I do in the future? Unset the arg afterwards?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10278#discussion_r115494670,115494670,src/test/net_tests.cpp
MarcoFalke,2017-05-09T14:44:33Z,"Yes, I think this is reasonable for tests.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10278#discussion_r115508318,115508318,src/test/net_tests.cpp
