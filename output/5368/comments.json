    "body": "Yes, there are several ways to fix this, and this one was discussed a bit. However, I'd highly prefer to hit coinsdb for this as inputs to mempool txn are likely to be cached anyway, which is preferable to hitting disk for a second block. (this also has potentially significant implications for pruning, as you now need to keep 100 extra blocks for any given reorg depth).\n\nAlso, could you include \"Make CTxMemPool::check more thourough by using CheckInputs 3215e5a\"? This should make the code much more robust in the future, though currently this branch fails those checks.\n",

    "body": "@sipa : a re-org happens on the main network on average once or twice a day. Extra block access is really NOT an issue.\n\nRE: not being able to prune to less than 100+plausible-re-org-depth: I'm OK with 120 being the minimum number of blocks a pruning node needs to keep. If we REALLY want to support pruning down lower, then storing the hash of the coinbase transactions in the block indices would be sufficient.\n\nRE: easier to allow immature in mempool: I really don't like the idea of relaxing the invariant of \"every transaction in the mempool is ready to be mined.\" Certainly this code is simpler than that alternative. I also think we'll have to optimize CreateBlock fairly soon, which will probably mean a mempool rewrite to maintain a priority queue of transactions-- so creating a block is just \"pop off queue until block full.\"\n\n@TheBlueMatt : including more thorough CheckInputs is a good idea, but I don't think I'll have time to do that until Monday (out for Thanksgiving).\n\nRE: run check() after reorgs are complete comment:  theoretically, you can reorg onto a more-work chain that has a lower height. That will never happen on the main network, but I hate to say never and I think we should be as robust as possible at all the edge cases we can think up.\n",

    "body": "There appears to be some misunderstanding here...I bring up the issue of hitting disk only as a way to say that I dont think #5267 is going to perform any worse than this in most cases, which it appears to at first glance, not because I'm necessarily concerned about relay times across nodes or anything like that (we have better solutions to that problem already). My point is more that I see #5267 as more obviously robust (instead of removing just the transactions we know we need to with a scalpel, we use a hammer and scan through the whole mempool to find the ones we need to remove) and performance isnt really a reason to chose this over that.\n",

Although I suppose if your disk is going bad you want to know sooner rather than later. \n\nA safe alternative would be to mempool.clear() if this read fails.\n",
