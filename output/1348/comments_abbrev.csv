luke-jr,2012-05-18T00:13:38Z,It would be nicer to find a comparable icon under a free license (CC Attribution isn't free IIRC)\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1348#issuecomment-5777260,5777260,
laanwj,2012-05-18T06:31:56Z,Sheesh I searched half the internet for a non-(L)GPL icon (and free for both commercial and non-commercial use) and it's still not free enough for you.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1348#issuecomment-5780649,5780649,
luke-jr,2012-05-18T13:47:59Z,LGPL and GPL are at least free... though I can see how GPL would be a problem for us.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1348#issuecomment-5786389,5786389,
laanwj,2012-05-18T14:18:44Z,"Ok, I'll find a (L)GPL icon instead. No problem.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1348#issuecomment-5787041,5787041,
