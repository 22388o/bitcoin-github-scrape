When doing that don't forget to enable `flake8` check `E711` in `test/lint/lint-python.sh` to make sure your fix becomes permanent until the end of time :-)\n\nAnd don't forget the technical rationale in the PR description: otherwise people who aren't familiar with how Python handles `is` vs `==` will incorrectly claim your fix is cosmetic :-)",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14903#issuecomment-445945664,445945664,

I did change the PR title to be more comprehensible and in line with the actual changes.\n\nutACK c9ba253f4f5d675d7736d24c1167229d0898ef1a",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14903#issuecomment-446943493,446943493,
jnewbery,2018-12-13T13:23:48Z,This exception handling is a vestige from when github-merge.py supported Python 2 and Python 3. We only support Python 3 now so we should be able to remove it entirely and just import from `urllib.request`.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14903#discussion_r241396925,241396925,contrib/devtools/github-merge.py
