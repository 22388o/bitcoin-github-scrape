laanwj,2014-08-05T12:12:17Z,"Right, the tests already failed. But no one has been running them with that version of boost, at least on a 32-bit system.\n\nThe Boost version used by the pulltester is even older than 1.46, and it passed:\n\n```\n#define BOOST_LIB_VERSION ""1_40""\n```\n\nIt's also fine in 1.54+. Seemingly the problem with non-size_t-hashers only exists in a relatively small range of boost versions.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4635#issuecomment-51188993,51188993,
Diapolo,2014-08-06T09:24:02Z,"Not sure I understand, but `key.GetHash(salt)` gives a uint64_t and we now cast that to size_t? Shouldn't some more places be size_t then and not just this changed return value?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4635#issuecomment-51311867,51311867,
laanwj,2014-08-06T09:37:57Z,"@diapolo GetHash() is a 64-bit hash function so it will always give a 64-bit result. \nCasting it to size_t is just to make boost happy. It may chop off the upper 32 bits on systems where size_t is 32 bits, but for a well-designed hash function that doesn't matter as the properties stay the same.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4635#issuecomment-51313048,51313048,
