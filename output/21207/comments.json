I put a lot of thought and effort into the moves, grouping related functions together while keeping the functions strictly sorted in dependency order within each file, avoiding any circular dependencies between files, and not changing any code at all. Things can move around freely after this, but I think the result is a great starting point for less monolithic and more comprehensible wallet code.",

A purely procedural style as proposed in  3e0a7ba is fine as an intermediate state, but it's not good enough for the long run.\r\n\r\nLet's take `CWallet::GetBalance` as an example for no particular reason. On the first look, it seems like it should stay in `CWallet` class IMHO. And in that case there is no need to move to `receive.cpp`. Of course, there are multiple ways to design this, so I'm curious how do you envision this.\r\n\r\nDo you think a class diagram for an ideal final state would be useful here?",

This PR and followup commit 3e0a7ba411a01160aa411c7aa78f718c2feed056 [refactor: Detach wallet transaction methods](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/3e0a7ba411a01160aa411c7aa78f718c2feed056) which is currently part of #21206 achieve that goal, except for the syncing, and #15719 begins to address the syncing.\r\n\r\nI'm not someone with strong opinions about object oriented style, but if you are interested in a justification for this approach the \"Non-Member Functions Improve Encapsulation\" idea https://www.drdobbs.com/cpp/how-non-member-functions-improve-encapsu/184401197, http://www.gotw.ca/gotw/084.htm could be helpful. #21207 and 3e0a7ba411a01160aa411c7aa78f718c2feed056 are just grouping related functions together instead mixing them up, though, so no need to get very lofty about them.\r\n\r\n> A purely procedural style as proposed in [3e0a7ba](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/3e0a7ba411a01160aa411c7aa78f718c2feed056) is fine as an intermediate state, but it's not good enough for the long run.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't matter to me if wallet spending, receiving, and syncing code is object oriented or procedural. Currently it's procedural code that's thrown into a giant class. The followup commit 3e0a7ba411a01160aa411c7aa78f718c2feed056 makes the procedural form more explicit, but there's nothing substantive about the commit, it's pure renaming.\r\n\r\n> Let's take `CWallet::GetBalance` as an example for no particular reason. On the first look, it seems like it should stay in `CWallet` class IMHO. And in that case there is no need to move to `receive.cpp`. Of course, there are multiple ways to design this, so I'm curious how do you envision this.\r\n> \r\n> Do you think a class diagram for an ideal final state would be useful here?\r\n\r\nI don't have any objections to someone rewriting GetBalance code in an object oriented style, but I don't have plans to change GetBalance. I just want to consolidate it in `wallet/receive.cpp` so it's not scattered all over `wallet/wallet.cpp`.",
