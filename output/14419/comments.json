The call should block and wait until the interface has been initialized? Similarly on how we block the wallet on calls until it has caught up with the chainstate, this call should block until all notifications have been activated/deactivated immediately prior to this call.",

    "body": "> How is this not a bug.\r\n\r\nThe help text for `getzmqnotifications` says \"Returns information about the active ZeroMQ notifications.\" If you call the RPC before the interface is active, then it (correctly) returns an empty object since no notifications are active.\r\n\r\nThis is a little bit pedantic though. This is a tiny window condition which as far as I'm aware can only be hit in Travis which has weird scheduling and delays. I don't think this can cause any problems for end-users actually using the zmq interface.\r\n\r\nI opened this PR to unblock #14336, which I think is a far more important goal than making sure that the zmq interface gets initialized before `getzmqnotifications` returns. If you want to fix that, by all means go ahead, but I don't think doing so should block #14336.",
