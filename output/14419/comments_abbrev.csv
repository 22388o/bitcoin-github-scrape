MarcoFalke,2018-10-08T01:59:53Z,"> Not a bug. Just the test trying calling getzmqnotifications before the interface has been initialized.\n\nHow is this not a bug. The call should block and wait until the interface has been initialized? Similarly on how we block the wallet on calls until it has caught up with the chainstate, this call should block until all notifications have been activated/deactivated immediately prior to this",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14419#issuecomment-427706239,427706239,
jnewbery,2018-10-08T02:43:51Z,"> How is this not a bug.\n\nThe help text for `getzmqnotifications` says ""Returns information about the active ZeroMQ notifications."" If you call the RPC before the interface is active, then it (correctly) returns an empty object since no notifications are active.\n\nThis is a little bit pedantic though. This is a tiny window condition which as far as I'm aware can only be hit in Travis which ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14419#issuecomment-427709831,427709831,
