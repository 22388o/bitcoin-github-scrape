MarcoFalke,2019-03-12T22:03:30Z,"Unless you switch the constructors to use member initizlizer lists with the ""`{}`-syntax"" that checks for overflows, I don't see how this adds any value.\n\nAlso, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8394#issuecomment-240981189",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15586#issuecomment-472199197,472199197,

dongcarl,2019-03-14T14:43:45Z,"w/re the parsing comment https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8394#issuecomment-240981189, would @laanwj and @MarcoFalke be more inclined to merge if this PR added relevant `ArgsManager` changes? This would be usable for both `-port` and `-rpcport` I believe.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15586#issuecomment-472894534,472894534,
dongcarl,2019-03-14T15:19:57Z,"Just for some context, this was motivated by my looking at [`GetListenPort()`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/8e1704c01537d1750555de23bfae00efa5864b3e/src/net.cpp#L94), which I believe casts `signed int`s to `unsigned short`s. I think pairing this change with an `ArgsManager` change with good parsing would make it worthwhile.\n\nAlso related: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1485",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15586#issuecomment-472914534,472914534,
MarcoFalke,2019-03-14T22:04:58Z,"I believe it casts `int64_t` to `unsigned short`, but that should be fine as long as we check that the value is in range before the cast. No need to change the return type here.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15586#issuecomment-473083346,473083346,
luke-jr,2019-04-17T20:39:39Z,"This is just one of many cases where a 16-bit `int` type could cause problems, so I'm okay with fixing it for future portability. But I agree that if we do, we should fix the call sites too:\n\n* GetListenPort (in net.cpp)\n* CConnman::ConnectNode's default_port (in net.cpp)\n* Lookup's portDefault, port (in netbase.cpp)\n* * SplitHostPort's portOut (in util/strencodings.cpp)\n* LookupNumeri",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15586#issuecomment-484252542,484252542,
