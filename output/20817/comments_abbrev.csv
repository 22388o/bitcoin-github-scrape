I wasn't aware that I used already codespell 2.0.0 (recently released in 23 Nov 2020), which is obviously more aware of various terms like e.g. `objext` as Makefile term and `copyable` as C++ term (see their commit https://github.com/codespell-project/codespell/commit/45b67b427489910b0ef5e4566c9b3989be3f0f33 which fixed this).\nCould either bump the codespell version",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20817#issuecomment-753428669,753428669,
