luke-jr,2015-03-13T21:32:14Z,"I think not. The debug information is far more useful to people than the console, which should only be touched by experts. I think it'd be okay to make the console a main window tab, though, provided it be conditional on some ""Advanced expert functionality"" setting in Options.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5893#issuecomment-79426327,79426327,
jonasschnelli,2015-03-14T08:32:31Z,"Okay. I see.\nI try to change this PR to allow users to open the console from a separate menu item and remove the console from the debug window.\n\nBut i disagree with having a ""expert setting"" for this.\nEspecially when compiling/running in -NOWALLET mode the RPC console can/is fundamental to the GUI.\nI would even say the RPC Console is not much more of a expert-function as the rest of the UI.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5893#issuecomment-80145776,80145776,
luke-jr,2015-03-14T14:17:26Z,"The entire UI as it is right now (excepting Coin Control, which is an advanced setting disabled by default) is perfectly fine (and indeed, better than any other wallet for) for the most novice users. SPV is a nice optimisation for _impatient_ users, but has nothing to do with skill/education level.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5893#issuecomment-80504499,80504499,
laanwj,2015-03-16T11:44:26Z,I prefer to keep this as-is too. The debug window is useful to get some quick information about the running node. It's easy enough to switch to the console if you do need it.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5893#issuecomment-81599943,81599943,
jonasschnelli,2015-03-17T13:12:13Z,Okay. Agreed.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5893#issuecomment-82338394,82338394,
