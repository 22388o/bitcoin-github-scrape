jonasschnelli,2015-09-30T06:55:41Z,I think it would make sense to also change from --disable-zmq to --enable-zmq (to fit the current style --enable-wallet etc.)\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6739#issuecomment-144307883,144307883,
paveljanik,2015-09-30T07:00:32Z,"~~I had the same feeling when I tested `--enable-bench`... But: `--enable-tests` is also enabled by default and the option is described as `--enable...` so I left it as it is now.~~\n\nLooks like I misread what you wrote.\n\nI personally prefer `--disable-feature` documented, when it is enabled by default. So I won't change anything here...\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6739#issuecomment-144309117,144309117,
jgarzik,2015-09-30T12:35:57Z,"If it's enabled by default, the feature logically requires a --disable-foo.  And the opposite, for anything disabled by default.

laanwj,2015-09-30T12:59:04Z,"Right - the reasoning would be thus: you never have to pass `--enable-zmq`, because if the relevant library and version is installed, it picks it up automatically.\nSo documenting `--disable-zmq` makes sense.\n\nBTW: if we want to be consistent, we should be consistent, looking at `configure` output, there are more options that start with uppercase, probably should adapt them as well:\n\n```\n  --",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6739#issuecomment-144388398,144388398,
