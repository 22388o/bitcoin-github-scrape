It was affecting some of my prs (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17227#issuecomment-806248409).\n\nIn the future since the build system is pretty obscure it would be really helpful if commit messages didn't just say what was changing but also gave some hint why changes were being made.\n\n- faaee1a36f7dc9",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21541#issuecomment-808931782,808931782,
