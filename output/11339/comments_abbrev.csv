meshcollider,2017-09-15T10:23:46Z,"NACK tbh, I don't think this improves the code at all, its clearer how it is (especially changes like removing the variable name from the header declaration, where's the advantage in that?)",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11339#issuecomment-329743654,329743654,
danra,2017-09-15T10:47:43Z,"@MeshCollider The advantage is just conciseness. What's the advantage of the generic parameter name 'data' for a parameter of type `CCheckpointData&`? \n\nA parameter name only makes sense in a function declaration if it helps understand the semantics, or if it is referenced somewhere (e.g. documentation)",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11339#issuecomment-329748366,329748366,
promag,2017-09-15T13:08:08Z,Agree with @MeshCollider. IMO if this is merged then it opens the door to a lot of similar PR's.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11339#issuecomment-329777738,329777738,
MarcoFalke,2017-09-15T13:19:29Z,At the moment we don't have the resources to review formatting only pulls. Going to close for now.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11339#issuecomment-329780349,329780349,
jnewbery,2017-09-15T13:27:34Z,"Thanks for this @danra . I think some of the changes in here are good (removing the redundant includes and intermediate parameters), but as others have pointed out, the review/test overhead for small formatting PRs like this tend to outweigh the benefit.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11339#issuecomment-329782313,329782313,
danra,2017-09-15T15:23:23Z,"@MarcoFalke @jnewbery Too bad. This isn't only formatting, and making the code clearer and more concise is important for its security and worth the investment IMHO.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11339#issuecomment-329814507,329814507,
jnewbery,2017-09-15T16:59:31Z,"@danra - I wouldn't frame this as worth the investment or not. Any change to the consensus code is a risk. There's a judgement on whether that's a good trade-off. In this case my view is no, but that's not to say other people would agree with me.\n\nPlus, using `auto` in consensus code seems to be strongly not preferred.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11339#issuecomment-329839766,329839766,
