paveljanik,2015-02-18T16:22:14Z,Why do you change various width and height?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5801#issuecomment-74893846,74893846,
fanquake,2015-02-18T16:56:23Z,"As far as I can workout, without those height/width changes the fee dialog box is no longer minimised when opening the Send tab, which would be altering the current behaviour. @jonasschnelli Can you take a look?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5801#issuecomment-74900853,74900853,

jonasschnelli,2015-02-19T14:02:29Z,@fanquake i will have a look at this as soon as im back from vacation (around 5th of march).\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5801#issuecomment-75056060,75056060,

laanwj,2015-02-20T08:26:58Z," I disagree with adding more text to the button ""Minimize""->""Minimize fee dialog"". \n- At best, the user would think `What is the fee dialog?`\n- Do we want to use the word 'dialog' in user facing messages at all? This is a UI design term not in general use.\n\nThis would be the rare case where a simple 'x' icon would be more descriptive than any amount of text.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5801#issuecomment-75204506,75204506,
fanquake,2015-02-20T08:29:17Z,"I don't mind either way, if an X would be better lets use that. It just needs to be changed from what it is currently. \n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5801#issuecomment-75204679,75204679,
laanwj,2015-02-20T08:31:31Z,"I'm fine with just moving the button, just not adding more text to it. The context should be enough to tell _what_ it minimizes.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5801#issuecomment-75204900,75204900,
