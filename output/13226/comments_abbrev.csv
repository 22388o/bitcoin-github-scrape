Xekyo,2021-08-27T19:53:51Z,"Hi @Empact, are you still making progress on this, or would you be open to the idea of someone else adopting the PR? I was just considering amending my prior commentary after not looking at this for a while, but I would be happy to take a look at the failing check instead, if you aren't working on this anymore.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13226#issuecomment-907440773,907440773,

achow101,2018-05-14T15:22:44Z,I believe this is incorrect. This will set `curr_waste` to `candidate_waste` which we don't want.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13226#discussion_r187994502,187994502,src/wallet/coinselection.cpp
Empact,2018-05-14T17:54:22Z,Fixed.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13226#discussion_r188042571,188042571,src/wallet/coinselection.cpp
practicalswift,2018-10-07T09:23:30Z,This will lead to an unsigned integer overflow in the case of `curr_index == 0`. Could change logic and ordering to avoid that?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13226#discussion_r223206454,223206454,src/wallet/coinselection.cpp
Empact,2018-10-08T05:01:25Z,"Fair enough, I moved the subtraction inline, which avoids storing the overflowed value in the 0 case, and is more consistent with prior implementation. Note the behavior is not changed as the 0 case also corresponded to `curr_selection` being empty.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13226#discussion_r223248439,223248439,src/wallet/coinselection.cpp
