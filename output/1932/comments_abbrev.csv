laanwj,2012-10-25T11:28:06Z,"I think this old position was more useful; after all, we'd like to know when the IRCSeed thread starts to do actual work (connecting to IRC), not so much the pre-flight checks.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1932#discussion_r1939503,1939503,src/irc.cpp
Diapolo,2012-10-25T11:31:14Z,"Well IMO it doesn't make sense to see an ""ThreadIRCSeed exited"" message in the log, when there was no ""ThreadIRCSeed started"" message, because of the pre-checks. I think that message should tell us ""hey the thread IS now running!"", nothing more. And therefore the new code positioning.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1932#discussion_r1939522,1939522,src/irc.cpp
laanwj,2012-10-25T11:38:21Z,"Yes that's weird. It'd make sense to move the printf to ThreadIRCSeed, the same function that prints ""XXX exited"". \n\nAnd replace the message at this line with something else ""ThreadIRCSeed connecting"" instead of removing it.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1932#discussion_r1939559,1939559,src/irc.cpp
