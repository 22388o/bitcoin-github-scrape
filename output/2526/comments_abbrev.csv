It, however, dies sometimes and fails to test properly.

Diapolo,2013-04-23T07:47:53Z,@laanwj ping :) I want to do another translations update.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2526#issuecomment-16844023,16844023,
laanwj,2013-04-23T07:55:43Z,@diapolo I delayed on this as I thought the 0.8.2 release was going to be\nreally soon thus to prevent any last-minute message changes. There is no\nreason for this commit to be urgent.\nBut I guess that one translation message doesn't matter so much. ACK.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2526#issuecomment-16844313,16844313,
