Thanks for sharing.\n\nWhen fuzzing the Swift compiler a few years ago I discovered some very entertaining crashes using a custom Swift fuzzer I wrote myself: [see some of these](https://gi",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17018#issuecomment-545401210,545401210,

MarcoFalke,2019-10-18 19:32:39,Can this function body be made empty? Only a few fuzzers need this.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17018#discussion_r336645391,336645391,src/test/fuzz/fuzz.cpp
MarcoFalke,2019-10-18 20:55:42,can remove this?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17018#discussion_r336672702,336672702,test/fuzz/test_runner.py
practicalswift,2019-10-23 11:09:20,"Yes, but I'd rather do that in a follow-up PR since some existing fuzzers rely on this. I want to keep this PR `Parse(â€¦)` only to keep it simple. It will take some investigation to figure our which fuzzers that rely on the current behaviour.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17018#discussion_r337984580,337984580,src/test/fuzz/fuzz.cpp
