    "body": "To get specific, I guess the immediate question is whether to keep the sentence:\r\n\r\n> One exception is that a `.cpp` file does not need to re-include the includes already included in its corresponding `.h` file.\r\n\r\nAs Marco pointed out, since it says \"does not need to\" instead of \"shouldn't\", this isn't actually incompatible with iwyu like I originally thought in the other issue, so I wouldn't object to it anymore.\r\n\r\nIf there is going to be a bigger rewrite, I would like to see something like:\r\n\r\n> Every `.cpp` and `.h` file should directly `#include` header files it needs definitions from, without relying on transitive includes from unrelated headers. See [WhyIWYU](https://github.com/include-what-you-use/include-what-you-use/blob/master/docs/WhyIWYU.md) for various considerations and rationale, and consider running the [IWYU](https://include-what-you-use.org/) tool to automatically remove unneeded includes and add/remove forward declarations.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, it is a little awkward right now to use iwyu with bitcoin, though I regularly do, and I previously posted instructions at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11878#issuecomment-351610027. It might be possible to add some build system support that would make iwyu easier to run, but I'd have to look into that.",
