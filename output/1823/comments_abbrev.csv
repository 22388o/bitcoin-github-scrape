roques,2012-09-13T18:21:37Z,"@sipa It is not even that bad:  Currently `SetCompact()` produces negative results for compact numbers with `0x00800000` bit set, whereas other implementations leave the bit set in their interpretation of the compact number or fail during verification.  If a Satoshi client get's such a compact number it will pass it to CBigNum.getuint256, which will ignore the sign and thus interpret the compact n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1823#issuecomment-8537872,8537872,
