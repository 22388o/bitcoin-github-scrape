jonasschnelli,2014-12-15T15:19:49Z,Check the travis build: it seems that the travis build jumps into the `LSSharedFileListItemCopyResolvedURL` which obvisouly is not available < OSX 10.10 (travis builds with 10.7).\nYou might check your `if MAC_OS_X_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED < MAC_OS_X_VERSION_10_10`.\n\nTestes on OSX 10.10. Build works fine.\nManipulating Startup-Flag works on 10.10.\n\nWill build and test on 10.9 after you made Travis,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5477#issuecomment-67008909,67008909,
paveljanik,2014-12-15T15:36:37Z,@jonasschnelli Can you please test on 10.9 even now? Maybe this is bug in how travis builds...\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5477#issuecomment-67011803,67011803,

Mainly, the SDK used for building, and the one used (by the user on a different machine) at runtime. To simplify, I'll expand on the two most extreme scenarios.\n1.
