practicalswift,2018-08-28T14:38:01Z,"@ken2812221 Actually there are only two warnings (`C4244` and `C4267`) that make the log output unreadable due to the sheer amount of them. Could you try disabling those two warnings specifically instead of disabling all warnings?\n\nI analyzed the warnings:\n\n```\n$ grep "": warning "" log.txt | cut -f4- -d"" "" | cut -f1 -d: | grep ^C | sort | uniq -c\n   1 C4018 == signed/unsigned mismatch\",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14086#issuecomment-416610313,416610313,

practicalswift,2018-08-28T19:16:39Z,@ken2812221 What about disabling `C4715: '[â€¦]': not all control paths return a value` too? We intentionally `assert(false);` unconditionally (in `default:`) in eight places which we don't want to change. This triggers `C4715`. That warning is not actionable in our case so I think disabling it is a net win.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14086#issuecomment-416707689,416707689,
