    "body": "I don't think that's what you're doing. I haven't tried, but I think this will cause a node to start IBD during reindexing or importing, as (!fReindex || !fImporting) is always true. So, to do what you want, those boolean conditions in the core testing for shouldn't be touched.\n\nI'm not sure it's safe to not set fImporting during reindex, though. It is not true that (in the current code) fReindex implies fImporting (fReindex just signifies that a reindex should be done; fImporting is only set while it is running). I think it's safer to keep the code as it is.\n",
