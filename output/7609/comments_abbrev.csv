AliceWonderMiscreations,2016-03-01T13:05:19Z,"I just wanted to clarify a note about the spec file and the generation of PNG / XPM images in the spec file.\n\nThe reason for that, the Source0 specifies the release tarball rather than github tagged release. The PNG / XPM files in github are not in the release tarball, so it was either list 10 additional github sources for them or list one additional vector source for the graphic and generate th",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7609#issuecomment-190716122,190716122,

wtogami,2016-04-30T03:08:25Z,"I wish I saw this earlier.  This RPM spec is far from clean, the quality of the .spec is quite poor and it would not pass any package review standards (like Fedora).  I also question why it encourages and offers to patch out the build-time prohibition of libressl which was intentionally disabled in Bitcoin.\n\nI do not advise going further with better automating this with a `.in` file until we've ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7609#issuecomment-215928323,215928323,

wtogami,2016-05-04T18:47:35Z,"If this is WIP, why was it committed to the core repo?  In any case it's fine to exist here, I will just suggest that people ignore it because it is of poor quality.

AliceWonderMiscreations,2016-03-03T14:33:59Z,Correct but the patch is needed for 0.12.0 source tarball as distributed by bitcoin.org. The README.md file states that the patch will likely not be needed when 0.12.1 is released.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7609#discussion_r54886851,54886851,contrib/rpm/bitcoin-0.12.0-libressl.patch
MarcoFalke,2016-03-03T15:08:38Z,"Is is useful to distribute those RPM spec files via git, considering that they need update/bump _prior_ to each release?

AliceWonderMiscreations,2016-03-03T15:31:35Z,"Well my primary motivation was to provide something RPM packagers could use as a starting point that puts things in the proper places, does the proper testing on build of the binaries, etc.\n\nRPM spec files distributed in upstream source rarely make into any package repository without some tweaking by the packager. For example, Fedora packaging guidelines discourage packaging of the .la libtool f",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7609#discussion_r54895703,54895703,contrib/rpm/README.md
