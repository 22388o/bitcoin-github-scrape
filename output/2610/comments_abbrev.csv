laanwj,2013-05-03T06:00:38Z,"Good. The code is unused and there is no reason to keep it like this. _If_ it is ever decided to bring the opcodes back, it can be done with better designed semantics w.r.t signed/unsigned handling.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2610#issuecomment-17379685,17379685,
