I.e., clearly spell out that the automatic prompting is only in the GUI, and that RPC users now MUST call `createwallet`, or `loadwallet`, or supply `-wallet` to `bitcoind`, in order to have a wallet available? (I advocated for putting this information in the error message, but that's somewhat abbreviated; the release notes would be one sensible place for a longer message about it.)",

    "body": "Well, the Default Wallet section says: \r\n\r\n\"Bitcoin Core will no longer create an unnamed `\"\"` wallet by default when no\r\nwallet is specified on the command line or in the configuration files. For\r\nbackwards compatibility, if an unnamed `\"\"` wallet already exists and would\r\nhave been loaded previously, then it will still be loaded. Users without an\r\nunnamed `\"\"` wallet and without any other wallets to be loaded on startup will\r\nbe prompted to either choose a wallet to load, or to create a new wallet.\"\r\n\r\nSo the message here is \"GUI users, have no fear, you don't need to worry about this\", and it does not mention RPC/CLI users at all. I am suggesting it should say something more explicitly helpful for those users, like: \"RPC and CLI users will need to explicitly load a wallet, using either the `-wallet=` flag to `bitcoind`, or the `loadwallet` RPC. (Or create a new wallet using the `createwallet` RPC.)\"\r\n\r\nBut it does say that in the error message now, after #20101, so one way or another they'll figure it out eventually.",
