jonasschnelli,2015-02-02T08:03:40Z,I assume there is a minimal post PR overhaul of https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/rpcmining.cpp#L444 required. IMO not urgent.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5711#issuecomment-72418747,72418747,
sdaftuar,2015-02-04T15:15:26Z,"This commit appears to have broken the rpc-test getblocktemplate_longpoll.py.  Relevant failure:\n\n```\n  File ""./getblocktemplate_longpoll.py"", line 66, in run_test\n    assert(thr.is_alive())\n```\n\nI'm not familiar enough with the test yet to understand what is going on, but I verified the test broke at this commit and succeeds in the previous one.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5711#issuecomment-72872274,72872274,
