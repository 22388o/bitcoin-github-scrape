I'll remove that commit.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19436#issuecomment-657021744,657021744,
meshcollider,2020-07-11 09:37:24,"Somehow I think this is avoiding the issue, the test is good but PushAll will still push 0x81 as a byte instead of using the OP_1NEGATE opcode if #17204 doesn't go in as well.

That sounds like a merge conflict\n\nAs I said above, the behavior in master avoids the previous issue, those PRs fixed the issue in a different way which would still be good to include.
