I've long wanted to move the assert up into `wait_util()`, but for some reason I thought there were more call sites where the return value wasn't being asserted.\r\n\r\nThis is a good change. `wait_until()` is a pure utility function and should live in util.py. The caller passing in the lock seems fine to me.",
