jnewbery,2017-08-17T17:48:02Z,"Great! Tested ACK 08ce33f8e95efa81b37ddc6b3350462c61bbfd51 . I've long wanted to move the assert up into `wait_util()`, but for some reason I thought there were more call sites where the return value wasn't being asserted.\n\nThis is a good change. `wait_until()` is a pure utility function and should live in util.py. The caller passing in the lock seems fine to me.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11068#issuecomment-323145450,323145450,
