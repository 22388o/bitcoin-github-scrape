jonasschnelli,2014-12-22T08:28:02Z,That was quick.\nNice!\n\nMaybe it makes more sense to reopen this pull when #5503 is stable and got ACK and merged. I prefer to have a easy reviewable code-pice because reviewing and testing is the bottleneck.\nAlso it prevents you from rebasing all the time.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5524#issuecomment-67812813,67812813,
jonasschnelli,2014-12-29T09:22:45Z,Breaks travis.\nMaybe you close and reopen this pull whenever #5503 makes it into master?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5524#issuecomment-68242696,68242696,

jonasschnelli,2015-03-11T12:37:37Z,@kanzure could you rebase on top of #5503?\n\nConceptual ACK.\nCould also go into 0.11 together with #5503 IMO.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5524#issuecomment-78254777,78254777,

TheBlueMatt,2015-04-20T21:10:55Z,"Why try to fund without watchonly first?

jonasschnelli,2015-04-21T19:56:56Z,I'd like to add this to #5503 but the nFeeRet=0 as well as the issue mentioned by @TheBlueMatt (calling `CreateTransaction()` two times) are unclear and needs fixing. RPC tests should also send a funded raw transaction and check the response to make sure it passes the mempool checks (i have a feeling that it won't because of the generated fee)\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5524#issuecomment-94919109,94919109,
