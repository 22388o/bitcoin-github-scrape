sipa,2020-11-20 22:32:53,Concept ACK. I can't imagine we'd care about the performance difference of -O3 vs -O2 for one object file inside Qt...,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20436#issuecomment-731441379,731441379,
fanquake,2020-11-21 03:23:20,"> I suspect @fanquake will hate the fact that we're echoing into a generated file. This would be much cleaner if done at the qmake level, but I'm not sure how to do that.\n\nThanks for the explainer and potential fix. I'm going to propose an alternative using a macOS scoped patch, which should be suiteable to merge into master and backport.

We've never really tried fighting that, afaik.\n\nI just wanted to demonstrate the minimal determinism fix here.
