MarcoFalke,2020-02-18 21:26:54,"Logging is preferred over inline comments in the test because logging statements serve as ""checkpoints"" (to see how far a test run until failure).

MarcoFalke,2020-02-18 21:45:04,"The trace is one data point that can help debug a test failure. The entire history of the log up to that point is also useful. For example transaction relay (inv-getdata) often takes several seconds, so it is useful to know when a subtest has started and when it ended. If some Bitcoin Core logs from one subtest interleave with the ones of another subtest we can conclude that we are missing a syncr",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18172#discussion_r380953432,380953432,test/functional/mempool_expiry.py
