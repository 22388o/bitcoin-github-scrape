    "body": "So the only concern here is that it makes DoS protection solely rely on hardness of PoW. That is probably safe, but it breaks the de facto rule on the network of not ever relaying data that is not known to be correct.\n\nAn alternative (first suggested by @maaku, I think) is just fast-relaying block headers as soon as they are validated, and using header-first-seen as tie breaker for choosing active chains in case of a fork. This does not mean deviating from that de facto rule, can be extremely fast (it doesn't even need the inv/getdata roundtrip, and doesn't need the block be available to be queried). I wonder what the consequences could be of someone broadcasting their header, and waiting a bit before broadcasting the block, though.\n",

    "body": "I don't think we should be serving blocks where we are unsure of the validity identically to blocks that we've validated. Handing bad blocks to SPV nodes, for example, risks creating a network partition between full nodes and SPV nodes even where the SPV nodes are connected only to honest good nodes. \n\nFailing to hang up on nodes giving us bad blocks (which they claim are good and verified) also means that in the case where there is a rule inconsistency the network may end up partitioned simply because nodes do not disconnect peers with the wrong rules and go find ones that agree with them.  These are all concerns which should be increasing because mining on alternative implementations is now being promoted (https://twitter.com/dajohi/status/455765633032916992).\n\nLuke had a pull a while back that IIRC added a new unchecked getblock. I think thats a better path: Don't hang up on an invalid block when we asked the peer for an untested block, do hang up when we asked for a tested one.  SPV clients that count on full nodes verifying for them would just never request untested blocks.\n",

If a node sends us invalid blocks with valid PoW, it's unlikely that that node is performing a DoS attack. Banning the node for DoS seems wrong for this reason.\n\nBesides enabling future changes, this change might also help transaction propagation in a hardfork by preventing a network split.\n",

That is hardly does-no-harm.  It could also enable theft from SPV clients who accept transactions from blocks believing them to be valid and that their full node peers are protecting them by validing blocks.
