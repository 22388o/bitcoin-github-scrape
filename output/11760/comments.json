Cryptographic code like this is incredibly stable, so the usual reasons for doing refactoring like this (easier maintenance) don't really apply - it's likely possible to not ever touch it.\r\n\r\nSo NACK from me, sorry.\r\n\r\nThanks you that you're trying to contribute, but refactors make very bad initial contributions. If you want to contribute something useful it's better to find an open issue and fix a bug, or add a requested feature.",

The Bitcoin fuzzer could be improved a lot so that might be an area where you could make very valuable contributions if you're interested!  The problem with the current fuzzer is that it is very shallow \u2013 we need the fuzzer to reach deeper into the code base to uncover bugs beyond deserialization issues. Sounds interesting? If so take a look at [test_bitcoin_fuzzy.cpp](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/test/test_bitcoin_fuzzy.cpp) and perhaps @guidovranken's code discussed in #11045 :-)",
