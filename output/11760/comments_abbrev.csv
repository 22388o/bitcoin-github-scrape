laanwj,2017-11-23T21:32:43Z,"I prefer not touching this code. Crypto code like this is hardly ever changed, so the maintenance argument doesn't really hold. Changing this pretty much just adds risk, and review load.\n\nI agree with what @sipa said here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11735#issuecomment-345912084\n> I'm not convinced about the long term goal of eliminating code through templates.

ldm5180,2017-11-23T21:46:01Z,"@laanwj Code always has to be maintained. This is what good testing is for. It allows refactoring with the knowledge that the old behavior is still intact. If there was untested behavior, then we don't really know anyways.\n\nTo address the concern raised by @sipa of eliminating code, this commit does eliminate about 50 lines of purely duplicated code.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11760#issuecomment-346701201,346701201,
sipa,2017-11-23T21:48:05Z,@ldm5180 You misunderstood me. I was arguing that eliminating code is not useful for this specific case.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11760#issuecomment-346701425,346701425,

Great to have you on board and looking forward to seeing future contributions from you! :-)",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11760#issuecomment-346823367,346823367,
practicalswift,2017-11-24T13:14:11Z,@ldm5180 Saw that you've done some [interesting fuzzing of Boost libraries](https://github.com/ldm5180/boost-fuzzer)! The Bitcoin fuzzer could be improved a lot so that might be an area where you could make very valuable contributions if you're interested!  The problem with the current fuzzer is that it is very shallow â€“ we need the fuzzer to reach deeper into the code base to uncover bugs beyond ,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11760#issuecomment-346826159,346826159,
