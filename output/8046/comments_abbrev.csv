jonasschnelli,2016-05-12T09:44:59Z,Thanks @laanwj. The signal approach is much better and actually a one-line change.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8046#issuecomment-218709667,218709667,
laanwj,2016-05-12T10:01:21Z,tested ACK (well not tested on OSX but that it breaks nothing on Ubuntu)  https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8046/commits/34ebceb25a40a2160349656265951cbe9a5b0f34\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8046#issuecomment-218713349,218713349,
laanwj,2016-05-12T09:29:59Z,You should remove this deleteonclose if you want to hold on to a pointer and/or manually delete the splash screen.\n\nNote that this changes the lifetime of the splash to the lifetime of the entire application instead of just while it is visible.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8046#discussion_r62990146,62990146,src/qt/bitcoin.cpp
jonasschnelli,2016-05-12T09:31:13Z,Oh. Yes. Let me keep the `WA_DeleteOnClose` and remove the explicit deconstruction.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8046#discussion_r62990378,62990378,src/qt/bitcoin.cpp
laanwj,2016-05-12T09:34:06Z,"But then you're not allowed to store a pointer to it, so you can't explicitly close it in this way.\n\nWhat you can do is make the splash subscribe to a signal that hides it.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8046#discussion_r62990826,62990826,src/qt/bitcoin.cpp
laanwj,2016-05-12T09:34:58Z,Eh such a signal exists: splashFinished\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8046#discussion_r62990985,62990985,src/qt/bitcoin.cpp
jonasschnelli,2016-05-12T09:35:40Z,"Thanks!\nRight. I though WA_DeleteOnClose would nullify the pointer. But right, thats not possible.\nLet me adapt the signals approach.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8046#discussion_r62991200,62991200,src/qt/bitcoin.cpp
laanwj,2016-05-12T09:38:13Z,"right - a ""weak pointer"" (qt has one in the form of QWeakPointer) would have that behavior, but it'd be overkill here\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8046#discussion_r62991532,62991532,src/qt/bitcoin.cpp
