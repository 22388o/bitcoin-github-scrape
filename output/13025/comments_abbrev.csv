My view is that the current tree should be kept to the minimum possible working set, and good code can always be brought back from the git history if needed. To me code removal is not a statement on its usefulness, but instead a statement on if it is used.\n\nThanks, y",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13025#issuecomment-382993796,382993796,
