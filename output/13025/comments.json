I have a collection of homegrown tools I have built over the years, and I use them in a tech debt consultancy I operate (sadly still no public showcase yet).\r\n\r\n@ryanofsky - I didn't mean to imply that they were vestigial at the time of move-over.  I saw your commit that moved them, then verified that the functionality existed in the wallet in current HEAD and axed it at that point.\r\n\r\n@laanwj - for the record I really liked the architecture-abstracted cycle counter utility, I see you are the one who added it.

    "body": "> I don't have any one specific method for finding dead code. It's just a passion project for me -- the only thing better than perfect code is no code at all. I have a collection of homegrown tools I have built over the years, and I use them in a tech debt consultancy I operate (sadly still no public showcase yet).\r\n\r\nVery nice! I share that passion! :-)\r\n\r\nPlease keep searching for dead code!",
