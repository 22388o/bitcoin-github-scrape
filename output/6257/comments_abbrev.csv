jonasschnelli,2015-06-09T12:04:43Z,utACK for the `paytxfee` in `getwalletinfo`.\n\nTend to NACK the `errors` extending. The errors are mostly warnings and i think it won't make sense to add them to serval rpc commands.\nI think a good example of how the `errors` field could get handled is the `signrawtransaction` rpc call.\nThe `getinfo` rpc call is not e good example IMO.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6257#issuecomment-110332221,110332221,
laanwj,2015-06-09T12:25:26Z,"@jonasschnelli I agree that `errors` shouldn't be added to multiple RPC calls. It does belong on _one_ other RPC call though as otherwise it would disappear when the deprecated `getinfo` is removed.\n(same for `version`, and ~~`protocolversion`~~)\n\nEdit: `protocolversion` is already on getnetworkinfo, I forgot.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6257#issuecomment-110339036,110339036,

jonasschnelli,2015-06-09T14:06:19Z,"@scmorse: at the moment, the general error states (actually mostly warnings) can be loaded over the `getinfo()` call (which is okay IMO). It should be named ""warnings"", but changing this would break the API (which should be avoided).\n\nMy recommendation would be to just add the `paytxfee` field as you did and remove all the ""error"" changes.

laanwj,2015-06-12T13:00:28Z,"utACK. \n\nI'd say don't bother renaming the category in this pull. I agree it's named wrongly and it's weird to pass in a string there anyway (should be an enum). Also the other category ""rpc"" is never used except to detect ""safe mode"" in `OnRPCPreCommand` by checking if the string is empty, which is also quite strange. It's very weird code so renaming the category wouldn't do it justice :)\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6257#issuecomment-111484392,111484392,
