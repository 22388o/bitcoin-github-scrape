theuni,2015-01-20T19:47:40Z,"@laanwj The work happened in #5582, this was just pulling the trigger.\n\nThinking on this a little more, we should document pretty loudly that 10.6 will not be supported for 0.11. It'd be helpful to add to the 0.10 release notes something like : ""OSX 10.6 support is deprecated and will be completely removed in 0.11.""\n\nI'll also add a change so that configure fails if building against <10.7.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5684#issuecomment-70719653,70719653,
