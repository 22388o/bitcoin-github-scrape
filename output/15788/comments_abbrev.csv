jonatack,2019-04-12T14:17:32Z,FWIW I haven't managed to get the fuzzing to run as per `doc/fuzzing.md` so cannot confirm or infirm that aspect for this PR. [Gist here](https://gist.github.com/jonatack/5179fd1842414147c2e691ba0e871310). It's surely something I'm doing wrong. Pointers welcome.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15788#issuecomment-482591474,482591474,
MarcoFalke,2019-04-12T16:56:10Z,"Fuzzing shouldn't be changed by this pr, but it would help if you posted your configure line (and config log) as well as the output of make. See also doc/fuzzing",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15788#issuecomment-482647151,482647151,
