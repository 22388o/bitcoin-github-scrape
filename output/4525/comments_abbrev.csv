laanwj,2014-07-14T10:03:13Z,Do we need this extra warning in addition to the **This is a pre-release test build - use at your own risk - do not use for mining or merchant applications** that already comes in pre-release builds by default?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4525#discussion_r14871102,14871102,src/rpcdump.cpp
