    "body": ">  you can post to a pthreads semaphore from a unix signal handler.\r\n\r\nI'm fairly sure none of the pthreads-api is signal safe, at least on all platforms.\r\n\r\n> Would also suggest that anyone waiting/reading from the semaphore/pipe immediately post/write back that way you could have multiple threads listening for shutdown as opposed to restricting it to only one as you do currently\r\n\r\nWe only need to wait for shutdown in one thread, so as I see it that additional complexity is not needed. If it happens to be needed in the future it can be added then.\r\n\r\nEdit: Travis issue is interesting though: looks like there is a race at shutdown where the HTTP server doesn't get to send back the reply to `stop()`. I'd be surprised if it is new in this pull, though it probably comes to the foreground due to the instant shutdown notification. I remember previous discussion about this in #11006 (esp. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11006#issuecomment-321373993).\r\n",
