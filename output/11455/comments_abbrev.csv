JeremyRubin,2017-10-06T17:41:16Z,"~I don't believe this is safe to do, because a 0 fee transaction may be in the mempool as a result of a disconnected block.~\n\nactually, with how GetMinFee is used, it's probably fine.

TheBlueMatt,2017-10-06T18:35:43Z,"Indeed, if there were an invariant in mempool that everything paid at least GetMinFee we'd already violate this (temporarily) in cases where mempool has been limited and we're mid-reorg, and more often when there are dependencies which result in something having a higher limit-enforced fee.\n\nStill, I'd kinda prefer the original other option where the minRelayTxFee is used directly in getmempoo",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11455#issuecomment-334836363,334836363,
MarcoFalke,2017-10-06T18:36:13Z,"I was about to comment that this should be maxed with incrementalRelayFee, as mentioned in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11410#issuecomment-333184250.\n\nBut then I don't see why we should keep around both (incrementalrelayfee and minrelaytxfee), as I don't see the difference after removal of pay-by-priority.\n\nI think my suggestion to create a separate commit for this fix was wrong",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11455#issuecomment-334836484,334836484,
MarcoFalke,2017-10-06T18:39:29Z,Might be better to close this and focus on the whole picture (#11410) again.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11455#issuecomment-334837272,334837272,
