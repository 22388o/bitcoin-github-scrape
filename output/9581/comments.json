As well as the (clang-format) discussion in #6839 (similar to these kind of changes).\r\n\r\nIf your going to do this, please combine all your changes into a single pull request. Then a more general discussion can happen about wether this is something we even want to do. As soon as you start half-enforcing style/formatting, you can just end up with \"fix-up\" pull-requests ever 2 weeks; while continuously breaking patches etc.\r\n\r\nMultiple single commit pull requests that only change formatting/styling/trivial things etc are not preferred, as each one requires review, and generates noise in an already pull-request flooded (with not enough people reviewing) repository.\r\n\r\nContributions are always welcome, but please be mindful of the workload you could be creating for others (especially so close to a feature freeze). If possible, combine batches of smaller, related changes into single pull requests. If needed, a single important change can always be broken out, as already happens with the back-porting we do.",

    "body": "@fanquake PRs now combined as requested.\r\n\r\nI totally agree that PEP-8 changes pertaining to whitespace, etc is overshooting.\r\n\r\nWith regards to PEP-8 compliance my suggestion is to keep it to fixing only really obvious non-Pythonic things such as comparing to `None`, having unused imports, not being explicit about imports, etc - things that should be non-controversial, unlikely to cause any merge conflicts and unlikely to mess up `git blame` on a large scale.\r\n\r\nBasically what @MarcoFalke outlined in [this comment]():\r\n\r\n> I think it makes sense to clean up the python code base in qa/ but please make sure you are not \"exceeding the goal\". We already had cleanup pulls which changed to a max line length to 80 chars among other things. It turned out the patch was impossible to review, actually changed behavior and would have introduced bugs. I'd rather have \"ugly\" code that works than some PEP8 code that crashes.\r\n\r\nSounds good? :-)",
