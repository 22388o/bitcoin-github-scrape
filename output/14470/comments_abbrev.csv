sipa,2018-10-13T03:19:59Z,"I don't think it's very useful to open a PR before you have an implementation.\n\nIf you have design questions that need to be solved first, you can open an issue, or comment on the existing one.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14470#issuecomment-429506846,429506846,
fanquake,2018-10-13T06:04:56Z,"I agree with @sipa. Pull requests are meant for code that's ready for review, they are not meant to be placeholders/a way to indicate you are working on something.\n\nIf you want to discuss technical approach/design, please do so in #12948. Then, once you have some code ready for review, please open a PR. ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14470#issuecomment-429514420,429514420,
rodentrabies,2018-10-13T08:33:32Z,"@sipa, @fanquake, that was exactly my intent, to use it as a placeholder and keep track of tasks for today:) Sorry and thanks for a guideline. Will push an implementation in a couple of hours and reopen.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14470#issuecomment-429522574,429522574,
rodentrabies,2018-10-13T19:32:18Z,"~Can this be reopened for review now? Tests are still missing but a straightforward implementation is ready.~\nEdit: nevermind, I amended to the base branch commit and broke the tracking, so I'll just reopen myself.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14470#issuecomment-429569084,429569084,
