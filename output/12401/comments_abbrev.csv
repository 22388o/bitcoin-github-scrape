sipa,2018-02-09T19:26:23Z,"I don't think the conditional is necessary. Also, perhaps add a comment that the reset is necessary to avoid temporarily having two `CBlockTreeDB` objects?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12401#discussion_r167323341,167323341,src/init.cpp
Sjors,2018-02-10T10:48:42Z,I put the conditional there because under normal circumstances `pblocktree.reset()` is useless. However I don't know what it does under the hood; maybe the performance overhead is negligible.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12401#discussion_r167395659,167395659,src/init.cpp
