promag,2017-11-20T20:29:10Z,@MarcoFalke any reason to not consider the suggestion?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11714#discussion_r152102352,152102352,src/test/txvalidation_tests.cpp
jamesob,2017-11-20T21:26:54Z,"@promag was happy to make the change but didn't have time yet, though it's worth noting that I'm uncertain on what the real difference would be aside from cosmetics. Note that `state.IsInvalid` with and without an argument call to separate methods, so why not get coverage on both?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11714#discussion_r152115643,152115643,src/test/txvalidation_tests.cpp
MarcoFalke,2017-11-21T09:51:33Z,"To me this seems mostly a cosmetic nit, subject to personal preference of style. For test related pulls I don't see a reason to block them solely based on style nits.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11714#discussion_r152223604,152223604,src/test/txvalidation_tests.cpp
