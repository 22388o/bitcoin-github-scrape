gavinandresen,2011-11-24T01:42:22Z,"Spiffy!\nCould you create unit tests and a test plan?\nFor example, if I want to test use of compressed and uncompressed keys... I would run with/without the -compressedpubkeys option, but do I need to use up old uncompressed keypool keys before I get compressed keys?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/649#issuecomment-2857324,2857324,
sipa,2011-11-24T13:42:40Z,"For testing, you probably want to be able to mix compressed and uncompressed keys. For production use, you probably want to just switch once and for all, so -compressedpubkeys would better flush all non-compressed keys in the keypool.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/649#issuecomment-2864596,2864596,
