promag,2020-12-05 13:25:43,How about removing this `RPCTypeCheck` (tests still pass as far as I can see)?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20573#discussion_r536758961,536758961,src/wallet/rpcwallet.cpp
jonatack,2020-12-07 12:02:49,I followed the practice seen in the file and the codebase when grepping `UniValueType()` and it seems to have documentation value for future readers of the code.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20573#discussion_r537453358,537453358,src/wallet/rpcwallet.cpp
promag,2020-12-09 20:43:26,That's fine. I just want to point that if removing some code makes no difference then it's because its redundant or some test is missing.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20573#discussion_r539633392,539633392,src/wallet/rpcwallet.cpp
