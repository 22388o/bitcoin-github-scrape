In that case, i would prefer to do a larger overhaul, including renaming the calls to be more consistent.\n\nI like the idea of putting version information in the URL, though.\n",

In other words, in the order of best to worst:\n1. Convey BTC amounts as integers, where the unit 1 is 0.00000001 BTC.\n2. Convey BTC amounts as strings representing fractional numbers.\n3. Convey BTC amounts as fractional numbers in a data type that is poorly-defined and imprecise enough to cause rounding errors.\n\n3 is what we have now.  Using strings is still better than what we have now, though I would strongly urge the BTC devs to adopt 1.\n",
