    "body": "Interesting, I had a idea about five days ago of how to improve estimation (which can be network-bound or cpu-bound):\n\n-Include with each checkpoint the size of the blockchain at that checkpoint (which will loosely correspond with CPU work as well as download bandwidth)\n-Include with the last checkpoint a multiplier to estimate additional CPU expense per block to do full verification after last checkpoint (i.e. blocks will take 3x more time to verify with signature checking). This can also be a guess of future network growth: \"how many more transactions per block will we see than between the last two checkpoints\".\n\nthen:\n-Obtain estimated (or actual) blockchain size at the current block, from interpolation between known sizes at checkpoints,\n-Estimate the total size/cpu_work of the current blockchain by extrapolating beyond the last checkpoint to the current height,\n-Progress bar percentage is current block's estimated size, divided by total estimated size.\n\n![progressbarformula](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1425520/160100/dffeae00-7758-11e2-82cb-e084a6481a70.png)\n\nMore advanced than I could write: curve fitting. The blockchain growth looks pretty darn exponential!\n\nCheckpoint blockchain sizes:\nblock, size\n(0, 293)\n011111, 2569495\n033333, 7820351\n074000, 28029745\n105000, 69840955\n134444, 341554543\n168000, 1032555361\n193000, 2491771562\n210000, 4099216740\n216116, 4855459871\n",

It started with about 100 week(s) behind, and the bar was nearly empty. Now I'm at 29 week(s) behind, and the bar is filled by perhaps 15%. I'd expect to be filled either at about 70% or at about 85%, depending on if the progress is relative to genesis or to app start.\n\nActually I'm not convinced that a progress bar is a suitable metaphor for blockchain download at all, because a) download never finishes and b) the blockchain is not a chain.\n",

This is as precise as it gets: if it is 50% full then this means there is 50% download/verification time still to go.\n\nAnyway, we had that discussion many times already. Believe me, it's a fruitless waste of time, better spent on things like payment protocols/workflows. Let's keep this thread restricted to concrete issues/showstoppers with the current code.\n",

In terms of transaction I cannot say, but if you look at\nhttps://blockchain.info/charts/n-transactions\nits pretty clear visually that the integral before \"29 weeks ago\" is more than 15% compared to the integral after.\n",

    "body": "Signature verification gets \"turned on\" only for the last 5000 blocks - the problem @schildbach is describing is that most of the download time is downloading blocks 0-216116, the progress of which is figured as 50% by 108058, but the actual percentage of blockchain size/transactions downloaded and processed by then is only about 2% - (see area under curve in my graphic above).\n\nThat's the problem which my big unacknowledged post describes a way to fix. Such a fix needs to mess with checkpoints.cpp; you're messing with checkpoints.cpp...\n\nThis pull is two things:\n1 - bar wording changed (\"blocks remaining\" -> \"days behind\")\n2 - post-final-checkpoint \"correction factor\"\n\n\"# 2\" being here has made it a place to discuss the other missing code:\n3 - correction of progress bar percentage to reflect actual download progress (size MB) instead of block number.\n\nIf you had just changed the wording with this pull, then \"lets also fix # 3\" likely wouldn't be bikeshedded here (I searched instead of filing a new issue.)\n\nI figure I could do # 3 with one very long weighted sum, but I'm at the \"build env, installed git, now...\" part of being able to code/submit.\n",

    "body": "@qubez Using block chain size or transaction count shouldn't matter much - they are very correlated.\n\nWhat this pull does is change the progressbar to reflect \"verification time progress\". Effectively, it counts/estimates transactions, weighing those after the last checkpoint higher, as those require higher much more CPU.\n\nThe factor used to scale post-checkpoint transactions should reflect the time factor (download + process + sigcheck) / (download + process). The factor that is currently hardcoded (15.0) was determined by running on some system, and indeed not taking download time into account. Doing so would probably result in a lower number. Feel free to do benchmarks so the factor can be improved.\n\nIf I understand you correctly, you suggest that your method (using block chain size, and hardcode sizes in the checkpoints) will better account for download time? I'm not sure about that - assuming transactions have a constant size (which, on average, is true) and the post-checkpoint time factor is reasonably, the estimation implemented here should be very accurate.\n",

    "body": "I have no problem believing that sipafactor(tm) is correct for your system and for a reindex or import of blocks already downloaded. However:\n\n1:\na. verification up to last checkpoint is not well multithreaded, vs\nb. signature verification is well multithreaded\n\nresult: end user reindex on 1 core vs 16 core will have a very different \"time factor\" correction.\n\nand\n\n2: end user initial blockchain download may have p2p network speed as a limiting factor, not CPU, in which case block number + correction factor after checkpoint will be completely incorrect - the progress bar should be the percentage of blockchain data estimated to have been downloaded (where 100% is an estimate of the current total size).\n\ncombined with:\n\n3: The progress bar is only useful for initial blockchain download - any other time, the progress bar is 99% when you restart Bitcoin the next day. Therefore, the progress bar should be accurate for initial blockchain download.\n\nStoring the known size of the blockchain at several points makes for better estimation that the \"factor\" kicking in at one point near the end of the download:\n\n![sipapercent](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1425520/165453/ee8966a8-7948-11e2-97cd-c8116a3e28fb.png)\n\nThere undoubtedly is room for some kind of factor, since we won't be storing and can't retrieve the exact size of the blockchain after the last checkpoint. Instead of simply using the same calculated block size from the last checkpoint interval, estimating data after the last checkpoint could have a factor like yours where we guess both additional CPU cost and future growth of block size.\n",

    "body": "@qubez I think you misunderstand this patch, given the graph above. I do not have a constant time per block (with a different speed before/after the checkpoint) - it's a constant time per _transaction_ (with a different speed before/after the checkpoint), and transactions have a pretty constant size on average, so it's proportional to the size in bytes of the chain.\n\nAlso, I do not claim the current implementation is correct for everyone. That's not possible with a constant slowdown factor after the checkpoint. For it to be exact, this factor would depend on whether or not your downloading (or reindexing from disk), the degree of parallellism you have for script validation, and a few other things probably.\n\nWhat I do claim, is that given a good factor (specifcally for the user's system - abstracting from how that factor is obtained), it is accurate in the general case. For example, if download time dominates everything and local processing/verification can be ignored, setting the factor=1 should result in more or less the same progress you'd calculate.\n",
