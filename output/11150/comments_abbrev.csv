mess110,2017-08-28T17:14:34Z,"@jnewbery thanks. I initially started in `mining.py` but I decided not to put it there because it would be ""cleaner"" to have its own test. In this particular case, I agree, the extra time to setup the test is not worth it\n\n@MarcoFalke thanks for the review and hint",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11150#issuecomment-325415750,325415750,
jnewbery,2017-08-28T21:47:08Z,"Looks good to me. We could test the actual values returned by `getmininginfo` more thoroughly (ie are the values for size, weight, hashps, etc correct under different circumstances) in a different PR. Testing the interface correctness in this PR is better than no testing at all.\n\nTested ACK 4f2905b76b502a9de235dbe739e5fe504ef5bc22",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11150#issuecomment-325492626,325492626,
