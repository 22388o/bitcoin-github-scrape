laanwj,2019-07-04 12:57:06,"Besides the conceptual discussion, I think this particular implementation has a few issues:\n\n- Interpreting a string as a number breaks API consistency; sure, from `bitcoin-cli` you won't be able to see the difference, but from other languages using RPC it's unexpected to have to handle a number differently from other places\n- Overloading based on how the value looks just feels wrong to me\",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16317#issuecomment-508473381,508473381,
