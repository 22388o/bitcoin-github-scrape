laanwj,2021-10-20 12:46:06,"I'd say ""For each branch to be deleted, first, make a `-final` tag to record the final commit of the branch, e.g. `v23.0-final`.""\n(I think this is good to do for archival purposes, could make this conditional on there being commits that aren't on a release or -rc tag, but i don't think there's any hurt in doing it always)",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23323#discussion_r732737698,732737698,doc/release-process.md

laanwj,2021-10-21 14:43:54,"Removing the tag is something you do on github, creating the tag is something you do locally (to be able to sign it), so assuming you have the branch locally I don't think there's really a conflict in the order.
