laanwj,2016-06-21T09:44:01Z,"On one hand it is nice to make it easy to join the chat, on the other hand one of the reasons that we moved from `bitcoin-dev` to `bitcoin-core-dev` is that the former was getting too noisy. The new IRC channel is for development-related talk only, not for questions or support or ancillary discussion about bitcoin or bitcoin core. End-users should join `#bitcoin` not `#bitcoin-core-dev`.\n\nSo ten",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8232#issuecomment-227391661,227391661,

jonasschnelli,2016-06-21T14:07:07Z,Not sure about this change....\nMoving the IRC channel away from the mailing list link and adding a webchat URL (IMO devs should not use webchats) looks after a step backward.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8232#issuecomment-227450639,227450639,
