    "body": "It's not clear to me that everyone understands what's going on here. And maybe I caused some confusion by say that zero is not an acceptable random value. No constant is an acceptable random value.\r\n\r\nThe variable is not undefined. It gets defined by the SYS_getrandom.  Memcheck has a flaw/shortcoming where it doesn't know or assume that sys_getrandom initializes it so it falsely reports it as uninitialized.\r\n\r\nIf it were actually undefined then that would mean that the getrandom call wasn't doing anything which would be a really serious problem because it would mean that the software getting random numbers it was expecting. Ignoring the other belt-and-suspenders randomness inputs, a failure to read random data into that variable would be a total break resulting in predictable keys.\r\n\r\nWith the code as it currently is, should some bug be added so that the variable is not initialized at least valgrind will start yelling.  If the code is changed to initialize the value with anything except a truly random value (such a zero or some random hash) then if a flaw that skips the randomness call is introduced the software will be just as vulnerable but in that case the flaw will be undetectable by valgrind. Similarly, compilers can often warn when they're certain a value will be undefined, and pre-emptive dummy initialization will break those warnings.\r\n\r\nAn assertion would not be appropriate because any value is acceptable random value, so long as it's actually random and not some predictable constant.\r\n\r\nAnother potential tool in the debate between \"pre-initilize variables and avoid the risk of undefined values\" and \"don't pre-init and preserve valgrind/memcheck sensitivity to coding errors that cause the required \"real initialization\" is that valgrind.h has special macros that can be used to mark memory as undefined in valgrind's tracking although they're defined for language purposes. (VALGRIND_MAKE_MEM_UNDEFINED(x,y), see secp256k1/tests.c). I'm not sure if anything similar exists for memcheck.\r\n\r\nIn some rare cases pre-initilization is a performance concern. But in most-- where the variable isn't in some inner loop and doesn't involve a bunch of malloc-- it's not. It is, however, very often a testing sensitivity concern. Of course, in some cases the code can be re-factored to do the proper 'final' initialization at declaration time then that's best.\r\n\r\nIf there were a big swing in the project towards performing dummy initialization I think it would be really useful if it were always done via a macro that would allow disabling it for testing (or valgrind annotating it).

In 2020, there\u2019s no good reason for uninitialized variables to be exploitable.\"](https://twitter.com/jacquesgt/status/1205376977831481345)\r\n\r\nI would assume that they do developer builds without `-ftrivial-auto-init=pattern` (no protection against exploitability but with unchanged testing sensitivity) and release builds with `-ftrivial-auto-init=pattern` (guards against exploitability but loses testing sensitivity).",
