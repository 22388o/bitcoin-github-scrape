I'd like it somewhat better if you moved the resulting jsonrpc.cpp to src/json instead.\n\nAlso, I might misunderstand what you're trying to do but you should probably remove the individual files (`src/json/json_spirit_*.cpp`) ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1749#issuecomment-8115606,8115606,
