jonatack,2020-03-29 13:56:54,ACK fae5d88,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18464#issuecomment-605639920,605639920,
jonatack,2020-03-30 13:49:43,"ACK fa6e01f\n\npico-nit: as the outbound peer connections are called ""full-relay"" and ""block-relay"" in the debug log, perhaps use ""block-relay"" rather than ""block-relay-only"". Though the code comments use block-relay-only, the -only seems redundant, though I may be saying that out of habit of seeing ""block-relay"" in the log.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18464#issuecomment-606011055,606011055,
jonatack,2020-03-29 13:28:07,suggest s/full outgoing/full-relay/ as the sentence already stated that these are outbound and the codebase (net.h/net.cpp/net_processing.cpp) and debug log call them full-relay,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18464#discussion_r399797878,399797878,doc/reduce-traffic.md
