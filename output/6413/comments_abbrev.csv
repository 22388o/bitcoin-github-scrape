laanwj,2015-07-10T12:18:52Z,"> utACK, but... I'm not sure it's actually safe to add repos for old Debian distros?\n\nI'm not sure either. I wasn't aware that we were recommending that. It's probably better to follow the build-from-source instructions under ""Berkeley DB"".\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6413#issuecomment-120397824,120397824,
theuni,2015-07-10T18:21:31Z,Agreed with the hesitance above. Adding a repo for building bitcoin is a pretty nasty recommendation. I'd rather recommend just building from source.\n\nAlternatively: has anyone tried pinging the debian maintainers? They may be willing to carry db48 in oldstable/stable. IIRC homebrew just did that for us.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6413#issuecomment-120486501,120486501,
