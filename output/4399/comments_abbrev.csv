laanwj,2014-06-24T12:48:35Z,"There should be rate limiting on this message (for example log it only once using a static bool flag). I think this is likely to return 0, and generating a message on every windows event is bound to bog down the interface.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4399#discussion_r14126875,14126875,src/qt/winshutdownmonitor.cpp
Diapolo,2014-06-24T12:52:32Z,"That's a good idea, but it's only visible when using `rand` category or log everything anyway. I also didn't get a single occurance of that log message during testing yet.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4399#discussion_r14127051,14127051,src/qt/winshutdownmonitor.cpp
laanwj,2014-06-24T12:56:32Z,"Right, but there is still overhead to calling this function for every event, even if the message is generated then discarded. This is a very low-level function and performance is important here.\nWhat I'm afraid of are situations like that at some point the entropy pool runs out and suddenly the interface becomes lots slower.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4399#discussion_r14127242,14127242,src/qt/winshutdownmonitor.cpp

laanwj,2014-06-29T11:43:10Z,"Going to merge this after the random.h/cpp change, so that we can have a function there instead of creating a dependency on OpenSSL here.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4399#discussion_r14328783,14328783,src/qt/winshutdownmonitor.cpp

laanwj,2014-07-02T06:20:11Z,"Yes but you do realize that randomness is one of the most critical parts of cryptographic software like this, and it's notoriously hard to test, so that change needs to be reviewed really carefully by multiple people.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4399#discussion_r14442139,14442139,src/qt/winshutdownmonitor.cpp
