laanwj,2019-09-10 16:00:08,"FWIW if you use bash as shell, you need to escape the `!` here to not get a `-bash: !host_build: event not found` error\n(I tried executing this command separately to test it)",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16837#discussion_r322829542,322829542,depends/packages/qt.mk
laanwj,2019-09-10 16:26:46,"doesn't look like this line is working, there's no bare ""QMAKE_LFLAGS"" in my `win32-g++/qmake.conf` at all (qt 5.9.7 nor 5.9.8)",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16837#discussion_r322842701,322842701,depends/packages/qt.mk
dongcarl,2019-09-10 17:24:43,Should we explicitly set `SHELL` then? The default is `/bin/sh` I think.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16837#discussion_r322868430,322868430,depends/packages/qt.mk
laanwj,2019-09-12 10:05:57,"`/bin/sh` means nothing specific, it's the default system shell. Isn't it theoretically possible for `/bin/sh` to be bash?\nEscaping the ! would be easier, I guess.\nNot that it necessarily needs to be solved, here, it's not a new problem, I was just surprised.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16837#discussion_r323659002,323659002,depends/packages/qt.mk
dongcarl,2019-09-16 15:03:48,"Ah gotcha, perhaps you know this already: when `argv[0]` looks like it's `sh`, I believe `bash` will be in posix-compliant mode.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16837#discussion_r324727107,324727107,depends/packages/qt.mk
dongcarl,2019-09-16 15:17:12,"Digging a little into this... It would seem that `QMAKE_LFAGS` was removed in https://github.com/qt/qtbase/commit/39fc377bf105ba09e2a8f9acae467dc789b96525, and first made it into qt `v5.9.0`. We can just add `QMAKE_LFLAGS            = $($(package)_ldflags)` back in though.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16837#discussion_r324734236,324734236,depends/packages/qt.mk
