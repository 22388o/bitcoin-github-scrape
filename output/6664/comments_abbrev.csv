jonasschnelli,2015-09-13T13:12:56Z,Good catch!\nThis should go in definitively.\nSplitting the PR into chunks that make sense and are independent would be nice.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6664#discussion_r39347519,39347519,src/init.cpp
MarcoFalke,2015-09-13T13:56:31Z,Thanks for letting me know. I fixed that and created another PR. There will be more noise but I think it is easier to discuss or merge when the PRs are split.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6664#discussion_r39347795,39347795,contrib/debian/copyright

laanwj,2015-09-23T17:43:49Z,"What is the point of this change? `#if !defined(XX)` and `#ifndef XX` are equivalent, with the difference that the first can be used as part of expressions, but I don't see a reason to change it around.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6664#discussion_r40233797,40233797,src/init.cpp
MarcoFalke,2015-09-24T09:53:54Z,The other six usages are `#ifndef` and it was a different author who chose the `#if !defined()` twice. But I can remove those if you prefer less diff over consistency.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6664#discussion_r40302482,40302482,src/init.cpp
laanwj,2015-09-24T16:19:19Z,"I just don't see it as very constructive - e.g. a) a lot of pull requests hit this code due to adding/removing arguments, and b) there's an infinite number of commits like this possible, the next person may change them to `#if !` again for aesthetic reasons. \n\nBut no need to revert it, the other changes in this pull are useful, so I'm just going to merge...\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6664#discussion_r40339053,40339053,src/init.cpp
