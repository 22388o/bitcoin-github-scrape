    "body": "As discussed, @achow101 ran his simulation with this modification. It did find 10% more changeless solutions and an overall decrease in fee expenditure, but there were a few outcomes where the final input set that was used to fund transactions caused change output to be created that just exceeded the dust limit. \r\n\r\nEdit: I see that you appear to always drop everything below `min_change` to fees, so we'd have to see how that changes the overall fee, and whether we might still need a limit for the overshoot of BnB inputs. Or perhaps whether we have to weight the excess differently than other types of costs that are less avoidable.",

I just moved it higher and passed the threshold to coin selection so waste calculation is based on the same tx structure as transaction building. What's new is that in case of BnB we will never created change now. \r\n\r\nWe already limit max absolute fee by `DEFAULT_TRANSACTION_MAXFEE = COIN / 10`. Maybe we can just lower the default?\r\n\r\nI tend to think that whenever we have a solution with huge excess from BnB, we should get the same solution but with change instead of excess found by other selection algorithms. The problem is that SRD has min change of COIN/100/2, and knapsack is not deterministic AFAIK. Maybe need to try to prove this more formally? Or consider adding another algo in the mix that will deterministically produce a solution with change\r\n",
