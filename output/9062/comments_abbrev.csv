rebroad,2016-11-02T13:45:58Z,"@laanwj you have a point - shall I add to this the removal of logtimemicros? I just didn't want to inconvenience people who already had it in their bitcoin.conf, though. Or make it so that logtimemicros shows only the first three decimal places?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9062#issuecomment-257868201,257868201,
laanwj,2016-11-02T14:09:17Z,"IMO we should just keep things as is. Either use microsecond precision, or second precision, or keep this as a custom patch. You could even postprocess the log to chop off three positions.

rebroad,2016-11-02T14:23:33Z,"@laanwj You are probably right, however, many other projects default to logging only milliseconds. I do still question the logic in logging 3 additional insignificant decimal places, given that lines (in my experience) are never less than 1ms apart.\n\nI like the idea of postprocessing, although ideally rather than post-processing this could be done by piping so that the unprocessed debug log isn'",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9062#issuecomment-257879191,257879191,
