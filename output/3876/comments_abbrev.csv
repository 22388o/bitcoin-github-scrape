felipelalli,2014-03-15T10:31:18Z,"No, I am sorry. Just code review. I am setting up the environment to start to contribute. I am reading all READMEs, and I read that I can contribute with code review and also test, which is the current bottleneck. Should I test carefully every change before send a ""ship it""? Even theses small changes? Thank you for help.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3876#issuecomment-37722489,37722489,
laanwj,2014-03-15T10:36:55Z,"Nah, it's not super important in this case. I ask just in case, I usually feel better merging something when someone else has at least tested it (even minor changes like this). Thanks for trying to contribute!\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3876#issuecomment-37722581,37722581,

haakonn,2014-03-15T13:36:57Z,"ACK.\n\nI tested this using 'bitcoin-qt --reindex' under Qt4/Ubuntu. Seems to work as advertised, and I really like it! The only change that arguably could be an improvement would be to simplify ""3 years and 0 weeks behind"" to simply ""3 years behind"". But that's a minor thing and I think this is mergeable as is.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3876#issuecomment-37725838,37725838,
