NicolasDorier,2015-11-23T10:16:16Z,"What is the rational on the default of 20 though ?\n\nDuring current rules, if all transactions max out the MAX_STANDARD_TX_SIGOPS (4000) we can get 5 transactions in the block.\n\nIn size, the maximum those 5 transactions would be is 20000 bytes. \nThis is 5 bytesperop currently. (without this option)\n\nNot sure if it is relevant though. Just interested to know why you chose 20.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7081#issuecomment-158896349,158896349,
