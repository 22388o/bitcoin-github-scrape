laanwj,2013-12-03T07:17:25Z,Cool @theuni \nI'll give it a try today (both with qt4 and qt5...)\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3346#issuecomment-29688177,29688177,
Diapolo,2013-12-03T07:37:52Z,"Very nice, thanks for that :).\n\nNow how do I use Autotools for Qt5 with Qt Creator, I remember I need to enable the Autotools plugin, but what follows?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3346#issuecomment-29689064,29689064,
laanwj,2013-12-03T07:40:26Z,"@Diapolo I think it's best to test on the msys command line first, if that works, you can try the Qt Creator approach (which none of us knows anything about).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3346#issuecomment-29689177,29689177,
Diapolo,2013-12-03T09:04:31Z,@laanwj Can you hint me the instructions to build with MSYS?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3346#issuecomment-29693226,29693226,
laanwj,2013-12-03T10:04:09Z,"Same as Linux, except that you need to specify the directories manually as they can't be detected, so:\n\n```\n./autogen.sh\n./configure --with-qt-incdir=... --with-qt-libdir=.... --with-qt-plugindir=... --with-qt-bindir=...\n```\n\nYou may have to specify the path to bdb and others also manually.\nWith ./configure --help you get a list of options.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3346#issuecomment-29696973,29696973,

I also checked that the Qt tests run successfully.\nAlso successfully tested (against qt4) on 12.04.\n\n> If a version is not specified, it will use the first one it can find. Qt4 is searched before Qt5, this will probably be reversed at some point.\n\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3346#issuecomment-29714612,29714612,
theuni,2013-12-03T18:21:10Z,"@laanwj Great, thanks for testing. As usual, I'd prefer to do that in a separate step. Defaulting to qt5 would mean that some devs would see a behavioral change when this goes in. I'd prefer to save that until there's a consensus on qt5. And since it hasn't been possible to use qt5 with autotools until this PR, there will likely be a few wrinkles to iron out first (mainly distro related, i'd think",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3346#issuecomment-29736338,29736338,
