You can type executable names and commands into search and windows will be able to execute them directly from search (assuming they can be found in PATH).",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12232#issuecomment-359173869,359173869,

I must admit when I typed ""Optional"" and saw ""Optional Features"" appear, I entered that thinking it was the OptionalFeatures.exe executable. Bad assumption. I'm worried others will get caught on this too. \n\nI'll let it up others to decide anyway :-) Cheers.\n\nDonal",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12232#issuecomment-359174740,359174740,
