jonasschnelli,2015-05-27T14:13:18Z,Oh. I missed that. Thanks.\n\nACK (if travis succeed).\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6194#issuecomment-105926707,105926707,
laanwj,2015-05-27T14:15:33Z,Does anyone know why walletbackup.py was not included before? Is it a test that takes a long time?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6194#issuecomment-105927445,105927445,
sdaftuar,2015-05-27T14:16:40Z,Seems to take about 30 seconds on my machine -- would it be better to move it to the set of scripts that don't run automatically?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6194#issuecomment-105927764,105927764,
laanwj,2015-05-27T14:19:13Z,30 seconds doesn't sound too bad to me...\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6194#issuecomment-105928445,105928445,
jonasschnelli,2015-05-27T14:19:51Z,"IMO it would be nice to have this test also within pull-tester/CI standard tests (even if it wasn't there before).\n\n@sdaftuar: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/qa/rpc-tests/README.md is also a bit outdated. Maybe you find time to write something about the new classes, comparison test cases, etc.... ?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6194#issuecomment-105928591,105928591,
sdaftuar,2015-05-27T14:28:45Z,"@jonasschnelli  Totally agree and sorry it's been taking a while, I've started work on implementing the first few of the java comparison tool's tests in the python framework.  As part of that I'm reworking some of the interfaces a little bit to accommodate the test; my plan was to update the documentation and submit as part of that pull (hopefully sooner rather than later).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6194#issuecomment-105931489,105931489,
