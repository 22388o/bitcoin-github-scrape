sipa,2012-06-14T15:24:13Z,"I don't mind having more granularity in choosing debug output, but if we're going that way, I think a -debug=all, -debug=none, -debug=net, ... is more consistent.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1458#issuecomment-6331823,6331823,

Diapolo,2012-06-16T00:15:40Z,"It could also be implemented as debug-level, e.g. -debug=0 (disabled) -debug=1 (all), -debug=2 (all, but no net) ... etc.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1458#issuecomment-6369382,6369382,
jgarzik,2012-06-16T01:20:11Z,"-debug=NUMBER and -debug=TOKEN are not useful for masking individual trace behaviors.  -debug=TOKEN,TOKEN,... is acceptable, but requires a mini-parser for the -debug string, rather than relying on -trace\* for the same effect.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1458#issuecomment-6369901,6369901,

Diapolo,2012-06-22T23:46:13Z,I'm missing `-debugnet` and a description what it does in `std::string HelpMessage()` in init.cpp.\n\nShould be below that line:\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/init.cpp#L258\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1458#issuecomment-6520722,6520722,
