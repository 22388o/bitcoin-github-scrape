laanwj,2013-11-30T06:21:53Z,"@sipa now using a different solution for HelpMessage, in which I split off the cli part to a seperate function and leave the main part in init.cpp. As added benefit this cleans up the function in init.cpp a lot by only having to consider two instead of three cases.\n\nIf ok, I'l rebase #3332 on top.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3320#issuecomment-29546821,29546821,
gavinandresen,2013-12-03T06:53:48Z,Compiling with -DDEBUG_LOCKORDER I get EnterCritical/LeaveCritical undefined compiling bitcoin-cli.\n\nMaybe sync.cpp needs to be compiled into libbitcoin_common?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3320#issuecomment-29687400,29687400,
laanwj,2013-12-03T07:12:44Z,"@gavinandresen thanks for testing\n\nI think that's indeed the most straightforward solution. There is no functional reason for sync.cpp to be linked into the -cli, as it does not use threading, but I've consciously avoided splitting up util.cpp here (and it's util.cpp that pulls it in).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3320#issuecomment-29688008,29688008,
