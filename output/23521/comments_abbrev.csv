theStack,2021-11-17 15:01:06,"As suggested by MarcoFalke, I removed now _all_ instances of explicitely setting block version to 4. FWIW as historical context, blocks are created with version 4 by default since #16333 (commit fac90c55be478f0323eafa1d560ea2c56f04fb23 was created in 2019, but the PR was merged only a few months ago).",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23521#issuecomment-971664494,971664494,
MarcoFalke,2021-11-17 12:01:54,any reason to set `4`? This is already the default and shouldn't matter either way?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23521#discussion_r751173671,751173671,test/functional/feature_assumevalid.py
