sipa,2014-11-02T07:20:50Z,Interesting; we should definitely do that. Can you move the logic for pruning setBlockIndexCandidates to a separate function (as the same code appears in ActivateBestChainStep)>\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5194#issuecomment-61396872,61396872,

laanwj,2014-11-20T11:01:34Z,Well I prefer to be of the safe side. Wouldn't want to walk out of the set in case of a bug. But an assertion is fine with me too.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5194#discussion_r20638740,20638740,src/main.cpp
sipa,2014-11-20T11:03:46Z,"No, I agree it feels safer to have the condition.
