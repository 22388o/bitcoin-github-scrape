Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate\n-with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried\n-out collectively by the network. Bitcoin is also the name of the open source\n-software which enables the use of this currency.\n-\n-For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of\n-the Bitcoin client sofware, see http://www.bitcoin.org.\n-\n-License\n--------\n-\n-Bitcoin is released under the terms of the MIT license. See `COPYING` for more\n-information or see http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT.\n-\n-Development process\n--------------------\n-\n-Developers work in their own trees, then submit pull requests when they think\n-their feature or bug fix is ready.\n-\n-If it is a simple/trivial/non-controversial change, then one of the Bitcoin\n-development team members simply pulls it.\n-\n-If it is a *more complicated or potentially controversial* change, then the patch\n-submitter will be asked to start a discussion (if they haven't already) on the\n-[mailing list](http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=bitcoin-development).\n-\n-The patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a good thing.\n-Developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches if the code doesn't\n-match the project's coding conventions (see `doc/coding.txt`) or are\n-controversial.\n-\n-The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be\n-completely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tags) are created\n-regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of Bitcoin.\n-\n-Testing\n--------\n-\n-Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull\n-requests than we can review and test. Please be patient and help out, and\n-remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people\n-lots of money.\n-\n-### Automated Testing\n-\n-Developers are strongly encouraged to write unit tests for new code, and to\n-submit new unit tests for old code.\n-\n-Unit tests for the core code are in `src/test/`. To compile and run them:\n-\n-    cd src; make -f makefile.unix test\n-\n-Unit tests for the GUI code are in `src/qt/test/`. To compile and run them:\n-\n-    qmake BITCOIN_QT_TEST=1 -o Makefile.test bitcoin-qt.pro\n-    make -f Makefile.test\n-    ./bitcoin-qt_test\n-\n-Every pull request is built for both Windows and Linux on a dedicated server,\n-and unit and sanity tests are automatically run. The binaries produced may be\n-used for manual QA testing -- a link to them will appear in a comment on the\n-pull request posted by 'BitcoinPullTester'. See `https://github.com/TheBlueMatt/test-scripts`\n-for the build/test scripts.\n-\n-### Manual Quality Assurance (QA) Testing\n-\n-Large changes should have a test plan, and should be tested by somebody other\n-than the developer who wrote the code.\n-\n-See `https://github.com/bitcoin/QA/` for how to create a test plan."
