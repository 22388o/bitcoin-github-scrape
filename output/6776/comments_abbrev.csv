dcousens,2015-10-08T01:03:44Z,I feel like this would be clearer as two (or at least one) `if` conditionals.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6776#discussion_r41466943,41466943,src/init.cpp
dcousens,2015-10-08T01:44:06Z,What is the range of `insecure_rand`?\n\n**edit:**`2^32`?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6776#discussion_r41468726,41468726,src/txmempool.cpp
jonasschnelli,2015-10-08T07:04:41Z,Not sure: but would't it be more clean to use `ULONG_MAX` here? Also not sure: if using `4294967296` instead of `4294967295`(= ULONG_MAX) wouldn't this result in autocast to `uint64_t`?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6776#discussion_r41481610,41481610,src/txmempool.h

sipa,2015-10-08T07:07:09Z,"Also, ULONG_MAX gives the maximum value of an unsigned long. Here we need\nthe number of possible values in a uint32_t. That is by definition 2^32.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6776#discussion_r41481731,41481731,src/txmempool.h

Diapolo,2015-10-31T09:00:38Z,IMHO this value should've taken a small comment :).\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6776#discussion_r43569779,43569779,src/txmempool.h
