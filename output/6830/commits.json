Reindexing using earlier versions will also not work\n+anymore as a result of this.\n+\n+* The block index database will now hold headers for which no block is\n+stored on disk, which earlier versions won't support.\n+\n+If you want to be able to downgrade smoothly, make a backup of your entire data\n+directory. Without this your node will need start syncing (or importing from\n+bootstrap.dat) anew afterwards. It is possible that the data from a completely\n+synchronised 0.10 node may be usable in older versions as-is, but this is not\n+supported and may break as soon as the older version attempts to reindex.\n+\n+This does not affect wallet forward or backward compatibility.\n+\n+Notable changes\n+===============\n+\n+Fix buffer overflow in bundled upnp\n+------------------------------------\n+\n+Bundled miniupnpc was updated to 1.9.20151008.

This may result in a lower\n+number of reachable nodes on IPv4, however this prevents future libupnpc\n+vulnerabilities from being a structural risk to the network\n+(see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6795).\n+\n+Test for LowS signatures before relaying\n+-----------------------------------------\n+\n+Make the node require the canonical 'low-s' encoding for ECDSA signatures when\n+relaying or mining.  This removes a nuisance malleability vector.\n+\n+Consensus behavior is unchanged.\n+\n+If widely deployed this change would eliminate the last remaining known vector\n+for nuisance malleability on SIGHASH_ALL P2PKH transactions. On the down-side\n+it will block most transactions made by sufficiently out of date software.\n+\n+Unlike the other avenues to change txids on transactions this\n+one was randomly violated by all deployed bitcoin software prior to\n+its discovery. So, while other malleability vectors where made\n+non-standard as soon as they were discovered, this one has remained\n+permitted.
