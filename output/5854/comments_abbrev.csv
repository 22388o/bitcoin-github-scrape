gmaxwell,2015-03-05T16:29:52Z,There are a number of other assert(falses) that should get exit()s by that metric; that is part of why the code still refuses to compile with NDEBUG.   I'd rather replace the assert.h macro with our own that is guaranteed to quit; and end the constant repetition of issues around assert().\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5854#issuecomment-77396716,77396716,

This solves nothing and may 'confirm' irrational panic. A) as it is, openssl rand will never fail, so this case isn't important B) building with NDEBUG is explicitly forbidden, and until we replace assert (which is worthwhile) it will result in problems in other places.\n\nThi",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5854#issuecomment-77565071,77565071,
