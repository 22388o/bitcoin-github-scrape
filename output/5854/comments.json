    "body": "> All it's going to result in is more panicked email which is confused about how assert works in the codebase\n\nI agree.. This solves nothing and may 'confirm' irrational panic. A) as it is, openssl rand will never fail, so this case isn't important B) building with NDEBUG is explicitly forbidden, and until we replace assert (which is worthwhile) it will result in problems in other places.\n\nThis won't make anything worse, but it just seems unnecessary.\n",
