laanwj,2020-01-02 16:47:38,"Meh. Also ~0 on this, ""ugly"" is a matter of taste and doesn't really have a place in these kind of arguments. I prefer the current syntax instead of columnar view.\n\nAs for grep-ability yea this will get you the first line, which isn't super useful. What I generally do is `bitcoind --help | less` and then search in there with `/`. This gets you the whole description and a way to browse it.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17841#issuecomment-570266106,570266106,
