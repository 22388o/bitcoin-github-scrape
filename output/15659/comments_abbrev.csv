gmaxwell,2019-03-24T22:14:30Z," > Return height of the highest block on the chain that is or has an ancestor\n\n""is or has an ancestor"" doesn't make much sense to me.  The function is returning the highest common point, if the block is on the chain, that's obviously itself. The comment in chain.h is correct and I think not confusing: Find the last common block between this chain and a block index entry.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15659#issuecomment-476006026,476006026,

ryanofsky,2019-03-25T12:07:35Z,"@r8921039, I wrote these comments and I can see how they are confusing. I wrote ""ancestor"" here when I really meant ""ancestor-or-self"" because it seemed less awkward (similar to how people write ⊂ instead of ⊆ in math for convenience, even though it can be less clear if you don't know the context).\n\nI think ""highest block on the chain that is or has an ancestor of the specified block"" is hard ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15659#issuecomment-476168353,476168353,
