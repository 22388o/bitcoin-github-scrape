BlueMatt's seed is the output of his published code (it is published publicly, right Matt?), etc.\n\n2) Does the address inclusion/rotation policy intentionally favor a particular interest group (eligious relay network or whatnot)?\n\nI would trust Luke's word if he promised the seed would always be vendor-neutral, for example.\n\n3) Is the DNS seed setup stable, and likely to remain stable in years to come?\n",
