laanwj,2018-01-28T09:15:01Z,"I think this isn't correct: C syntax `A = B = C = D = X` sets A,B,C,D to X..

donaloconnor,2018-01-28T16:45:54Z,Yes you are correct. Assignment happens from right to left. However I am not really a fan of the multiple assignment per line in this case since we are mixing reverence and value type assigmnents. It's a personal thing I guess but I usually like to separate such logic in multi-line as it helps with debugging etc. The compiler will optimize it anyway :-),https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12276#discussion_r164304656,164304656,src/wallet/wallet.cpp
