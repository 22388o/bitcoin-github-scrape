achow101,2017-10-30T19:02:48Z,Why are non-hd wallets needed for #9662?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11582#issuecomment-340550696,340550696,
luke-jr,2017-10-30T19:20:15Z,Because the goal of #9662 is to not have the internal wallet generating ANY keys. It's to watch specific addresses only.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11582#issuecomment-340555273,340555273,
TheBlueMatt,2017-10-30T23:04:24Z,"Please no. We really don't need a combinatoric blowup in the number of supported wallet options and setups. How about instead support having a public-only HD seed (and if none is provided generate one, who cares, you're just watching a few extra addresses that will never be used).",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11582#issuecomment-340610975,340610975,
luke-jr,2017-10-30T23:20:15Z,"@TheBlueMatt That assumes all wallets are HD. Additionally, using public derivation is contentious. Finally, watching addresses not part of the real wallet has risks - someone could gain read access to your wallet and send to those addresses, and you'd mistakenly think they were safe on your hardware wallet.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11582#issuecomment-340613769,340613769,
TheBlueMatt,2017-10-30T23:22:26Z,"All newly-created wallets will be HD, though, and supporting a matrix of HD, Segwit, Watch-Only, etc, etc and all combinations thereof blows up maintinence complexity a ton. In any case, a watch-only wallet is going to need a mode that forces it to never generate new addresses, so having an HD seed or not having an HD seed wont matter - you still wont get new addresses.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11582#issuecomment-340614129,340614129,
achow101,2017-10-31T00:09:37Z,"Since #9662 should be disabling all forms of key generation, I don't see why you need to have `-usehd=0`. Why can't you just have a wallet type which has no private keys whatsoever? Instead of doing `-usehd=0`, you just have `-disablehot` which then doesn't generate a HD master key or any other key.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11582#issuecomment-340621448,340621448,
luke-jr,2017-10-31T00:42:08Z,"@TheBlueMatt Watchonly-only wallets aren't HD. Maintenance complexity isn't affected, because we still need to support non-HD wallets regardless. I see no value in writing an ignored HD seed - it only creates the risk that we accidentally use it rather than crash or fail.\n\n@achow101 I suppose that's a possibility, but I don't see the harm in having the option...",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11582#issuecomment-340626172,340626172,
morcos,2017-10-31T13:15:15Z,"From a user perspective, if we don't support creating new non-HD wallets, then it makes no sense to provide a `-usehd=0` option.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11582#issuecomment-340758313,340758313,
MarcoFalke,2017-10-31T15:13:48Z,Agree with @achow101. There is really no need to set hd/nohd when key generation is turned off completely.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11582#issuecomment-340794446,340794446,
MarcoFalke,2017-11-09T22:16:10Z,Closing for now.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11582#issuecomment-343309724,343309724,
