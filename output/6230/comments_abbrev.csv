jtimon,2015-06-26T10:24:15Z,Added an alternative solution to the bug described in #6299. It may also solve #5984 (at least it shares some code with #5987) and maybe also other bugs related to not having a genesis checkpoint (the genesis block) in all chain modes.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6230#issuecomment-115632660,115632660,
jtimon,2015-06-26T15:56:11Z,"Rebased after merging #6299. Apart from its original form, now this PR additionally has the a removal of the now-unnecessary check for the genesis hash block (and an additional big indentation commit).\nLet's wait for testing, I think it was safer to just merge #6299, but I truly believe the existence of a fully-trustable genesis checkpoint is the necessary step for decoupling the checkpoint logic",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6230#issuecomment-115739501,115739501,
jtimon,2015-07-01T17:26:59Z,"Updated without adding any tests or sharing a commit with #6229.\n@sdaftuar Can you confirm that this also solves the problem you found, which was solved in #6299 ?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6230#issuecomment-117758017,117758017,

jtimon,2015-07-01T21:35:52Z,"Yes, @sdaftuar , you're right, this is no alternative fix of #6299 .\nI was testing it wrong, but fortunately qa/rpc-tests/reindex.py noticed, great!\nI removed everything but the single commit introducing the ""genesis checkpoints"", which @TheBlueMatt should like because he did the equivalent for alpha-0.10.\nIf @luke-jr rebases #5987 on top of this I can close the PR.\n\nIn summary and to reitera",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6230#issuecomment-117831542,117831542,
jtimon,2015-07-06T08:24:49Z,Closing for now. I will reopen again with the version with the tests. In the meantime @luke-jr can take this for his PR if he wants to.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6230#issuecomment-118772682,118772682,
