fanquake,2018-07-03T01:49:11Z,"Concept ACK\n\n@practicalswift What are you doing to find the unused arguments? I'm curious because (from a quick glance) there are more functions in those same files that also have unused arguments. Any reason not to include them here?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13554#issuecomment-401988235,401988235,

Let me know and Iâ€™ll investigate why the commercial static analyzer I used for this specific analysis missed them.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13554#issuecomment-403087232,403087232,
