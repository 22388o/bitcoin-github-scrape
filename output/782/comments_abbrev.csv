I think you need to do a bit more than just that...If you're first setting pubkey to be vchpubkey, then obviously they will be equal. But eventually, I can test it to make sure...\n\nIf you wanna peek at my code that implements such a function in C, take a look at the function priv_to_pub in https://github.com/piratelinux/cwallet/blob/master/src/util.h\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/782#issuecomment-3645455,3645455,

piratelinux,2012-01-25T23:18:58Z,"I still don't think it will work, because I think what SetPrivKey does is take the public key part of the full private key, but if the secret part (usually 32 bytes) is corrupted, it wouldn't know. I did a rough test, but maybe if you could send me a release that I can compile and you're confident works, then I can do a more thorough test. The master branch of bitcoin is not compiling for me.\nTha",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/782#issuecomment-3661276,3661276,
