jnewbery,2018-05-23T13:44:48Z,You can use `self.sync_all()` here to avoid the additional import.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13304#discussion_r190251301,190251301,test/functional/wallet_listreceivedby.py
jnewbery,2018-05-23T13:46:43Z,No need to remove this. It looks like this log indicates that this part of the test is for `listreceivedbyaddress` compared with the next parts of the test for `getreceivedbyaddress` and `listreceivedbylabel`/`getreceivedbylabel`.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13304#discussion_r190251989,190251989,test/functional/wallet_listreceivedby.py
MarcoFalke,2018-05-23T13:53:32Z,Thanks. Removing the log statement was incorrect. Fixed up...,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13304#discussion_r190254572,190254572,test/functional/wallet_listreceivedby.py
