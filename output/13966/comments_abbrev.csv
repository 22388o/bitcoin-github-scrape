Sjors,2018-09-07T20:10:33Z,"Concept ACK, the distinction between""spendable"" and ""watch-only"" is confusing anyway, and a big source of [scams](https://blog.blockchain.com/2018/04/11/addressing-watch-only-scams/) (even if  that particular scam is less likely here, though something to be aware of once #13100 is merged).\n\nThe concept of watch-only might become less clear in general moving forward. @sipa does this get in the ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13966#issuecomment-419552560,419552560,
instagibbs,2018-09-14T19:52:34Z,"@fanquake based on your image, I think some indications that private keys are disabled is probably desired?

sipa,2018-11-11T03:23:57Z,"Only vaguely related, @gmaxwell suggested that perhaps we want a wallet-wide flag to treat all watchonly stuff as normal ismine.
