gmaxwell,2017-07-14T00:00:50Z,"This will spam the orphan map somewhat after flushing, unfortunately-- but we can fix this by making flushing less hard in the future... and the orphan map is much less important than it used to be already.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10557#issuecomment-315233569,315233569,
TheBlueMatt,2017-07-14T18:39:03Z,"I still think we should take this for 15, but another thing to consider is to add a rolling bloom filter in net_processing ala https://github.com/TheBlueMatt/bitcoin/commit/316516cfd872a812f9672834c857bd084c5a877a (which is based on a big pile of changes, but could be pulled out separately), on top of this change.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10557#issuecomment-315435434,315435434,
sipa,2017-06-08T18:17:23Z,"I believe this risks resulting in `true` for transactions that are in fact not yet confirmed and not in the mempool, but were just disconnected in a reorg.

sdaftuar,2017-06-08T18:31:51Z,"Can we just change `HaveCoinInCache()` to have the same semantics as `HaveCoin()`, and only return true if the coin is unspent?  Seems confusing that their semantics aren't the same.\n\nFor many of the existing usages of `HaveCoinInCache()`, we store the result to potentially `Uncache()` later -- but I don't think it's possible to ever have a spent coin in your cache that is able to be uncached ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10557#discussion_r120965053,120965053,src/validation.cpp
morcos,2017-06-08T18:57:46Z,"@sipa I actually think that's likely a better outcome, but it may be too confusing.  If a tx was just disconnected in a reorg, and no longer has one of its inputs available, it means it or its parent was probably double spent and so it shouldn't be in the orphan map anyway. \n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10557#discussion_r120971512,120971512,src/validation.cpp
sipa,2017-06-08T20:03:27Z,@morcos Do you think it's worth the complexity? I like @sdaftuar's suggestion.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10557#discussion_r120985013,120985013,src/validation.cpp
morcos,2017-06-08T20:54:54Z,"Yes I like his suggestion as well.\nI think this PR is ""correct"" as is, and I will make that change in a separate PR as a fix to HaveCoinsInCache?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10557#discussion_r120996492,120996492,src/validation.cpp
