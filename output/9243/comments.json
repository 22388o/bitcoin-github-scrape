    "body": "re zmq: I understand you considered two different \"problems\":\r\n1) Not considering the code for retrieving the values elegant. I guess of the ugly use of const_iterator just as the simplest way to comply with the parameter map being const instead of using the global (not the implementor, see below). Or maybe the \"hackish\" way in which the keys for the args are constructed using string manipulation, but you're maintaining that in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9243/commits/e87822043d4118d1b02d066ee213d341af3ff4e9#diff-ae0c52c7aa40615ed94ef5603b768010R45 \r\n\r\n2) You also consider that passing all the args to the constructor was a bad idea in the first place. In defense of the implementor, IIRC it was me who asked for this. Because I think it's the way forwards for zmq, chainparams, \"policy\" and wallet not to depend on util globals (which is not a priority since none of these parts should be used in the consensus module anyway). In this reward I've been looking for feedback for very long and very much welcome it in any of these PRs: #8994 #7820 https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7557#issuecomment-189479930 #6068  #5595\r\nBut if I understood your ideal design described here, functions should get all parameters they care about explicitly. Without necessarily disagreeing (I think it depends on the case), in the case of  CZMQNotificationInterface::Create that would imply to take 4 values for \"std::string address\" in the loop explicitly, which is something you're not doing in this PR (not asking you to do so, just pointing it out).\r\nWhat I would be very thankful of if you could change in that commit is replacing \"garbage\" for something more specific about what you don't like about it, if not for the shake of clarity, just out of respect for other contributors. Don't want to sound patronizing, I believe I make this same mistake very often when finding things I don't like and I don't know the history about.\r\n\r\n> Note that this PR isnt about creating an \"ideal design\" it is about fixing actual race conditions in mapArgs accessing as used in the codebase today. \r\n\r\nI'm very sorry for overreacting by misinterpreting this as an \"ideal design\" without joining what I understand as an ongoing discussion. For example, @MarcoFalke seems to be ok with passing the argsMap explicitly where we can, as long as the 2 maps were hidden behind a class first, which I wasn't very fond of at first, but I think makes sense. Also, somewhere in #5595 had an idea for making a dynamic qt form for configuring policy from an argMap and something like my std::vector<std::pair<std::string, std::string> > CDefaultPolicy::GetOptionsHelp() (something like in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7820/files#diff-d22bc3e058f8982972e2eb381a1df668R261 but with a single thing looks ridiculous). I loved that idea, and thought it was extensible for other things (and I'm all fine with these new options requiring restart). Anyway, as said, I'm happy to keep discussing this but this is not the place and I already disrupted the thread of this PR enough.\r\n\r\n>  (ok, admittedly that arent a big deal) \r\n\r\nJust as globals, \"known\" race conditions make reasoning about how the system works harder.\r\nI agree that removing those, no matter how \"big deal\" they are, should take preference over reducing the use of globals. I just wasn't convinced we couldn't do it without the new lock with a few more lines, but now I'm convinced adding the lock is the most straightforward way to solve the issue.\r\n\r\n> Eventually mapArgs will only exist in init.cpp and the relevant args passed around to different submodules as neccessary, but for now, this makes it obviously safe.\r\n\r\nI agree that in many cases this is what makes the most sense, but we shouldn't disregard \"shortcuts\" like Consensus::Params, chainparams, policy...(again, probably not to discuss in this PR, I'm making too much noise in this PR already).\r\n\r\n ",
