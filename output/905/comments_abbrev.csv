dooglus,2012-04-07T16:11:18Z,"@gavinandresen I noticed that the shuffle was missing some time ago.  It has been added back in in #1017 which is my current branch for these changes, and includes the coincontrol and lesschange changes too.\n\nI'll also add a new unit test for randomness too.\n\nDo you need this pull request with just the refactoring updated too?  I merged these related changes all together to make them easier to",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/905#issuecomment-5009670,5009670,
dooglus,2012-04-07T17:28:13Z,"Notice that the coins are sorted into order before running the stochastic approximation:\n\n```\n// Solve subset sum by stochastic approximation\nsort(vValue.rbegin(), vValue.rend());\n```\n\nand so the shuffle's work will be undone in the case you propose.  The only times the shuffle has any effect is if:\n1. there are multiple coins with the exact value requested (e.g. have 1,1,1 and request 1),",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/905#issuecomment-5010163,5010163,

gavinandresen,2012-04-06T15:24:23Z,"The random_shuffle was deleted here, but I don't see any calls to randomize the coins selected.  A random_shuffle of the result of AvailableCoins should probably be done so coin selection is unpredictable.\n\nA unit test to test randomness  that calls SelectCoins two times to get (say) 5 out of 100 coins, all of the same value/age, and fails if exactly the same coins are selected would also be nif",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/905#discussion_r655273,655273,src/wallet.cpp
