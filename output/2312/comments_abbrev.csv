Diapolo,2013-02-22T17:01:19Z,"Really, I can be a fucking damn nit-picker, but that indentation thing could have been fixed. I'm thinking about never doing anything coding style related in core (if that is what you guys want, then win-win :-P).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2312#issuecomment-13955651,13955651,
gmaxwell,2013-02-22T17:20:35Z,"@diapolo I _did_ change the indentation.  Please don't be rude about it, I am listening and I do care... but as much as people shouldn't be offended when you make nits, you shouldn't be offended by people's responses.\n\nPersonally, I'm fine to have your style nits, my preferred style is something else no one here wants— and sometimes a bit of it leaks through, so I'm happy to have people point it",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2312#issuecomment-13956558,13956558,
