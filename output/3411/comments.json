The original pull request was not listed in the\nset of pull requests on github. I had to delete the repo and then recreate\nit and there was a 501 error. I had to contact technical support. The pull\nrequest was no longer associated with the repo.\n\nThere was no option for amending the pull request and the previous branch\nno longer existed.\n\nOn Fri, Dec 13, 2013 at 3:59 AM, BitcoinPullTester <notifications@github.com\n\n> wrote:\n> \n> Automatic sanity-testing: PASSED, see\n> http://jenkins.bluematt.me/pull-tester/1d2feb2da68c7ccd69b4b3d74eaaa65b5715a3e8for binaries and test log.\n> This test script verifies pulls every time they are updated.
