MarcoFalke,2016-04-01T16:33:41Z,Nit: Couldn't this be just one line?\n\nSomething like\n\n``` py\nbranch = args.branch or opt_branch or info['base']['ref'] or 'master'\n```\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7781#discussion_r58231429,58231429,contrib/devtools/github-merge.py
laanwj,2016-04-02T05:22:21Z,"That's much shorter, also seems to work:\n\n```\n>>> None or 'a' or 'b' or 'c'\n'a'\n>>> None or None or 'b' or 'c'\n'b'\n>>> None or None or None or 'c'\n'c'\n>>> 'f' or None or None or 'c'\n'f'\n```\n\nI think the subtle difference in this case is that '' is seen as False (hence the use of `is None`. But doesn't matter here, an empty branch name is pointless.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7781#discussion_r58288907,58288907,contrib/devtools/github-merge.py
