rebroad,2012-05-21T10:19:41Z,"Ok. Now updated. The only change now is the printfs, and the change of nMisbehaviour is no longer moved. This move would not have changed anything though, as the only place where the value is read is in this function, and it's only acted upon if the peer is NOT local, so the treatment of local nodes did remain the same, other than the value of nMisbehaviour changing but not being acted upon.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1343#issuecomment-5819362,5819362,

rebroad,2012-06-14T16:34:05Z,"There is already a line that says when it disconnects, so with this patch, you'll see the Misbehaving: (80 -> 100), followed by a line that says disconnecting. It can be derived that the disconnection was for misbehaviour as the two lines would be together, and the Misbehaving number would clearly have reached 100 (or higher).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1343#discussion_r986134,986134,src/net.cpp
