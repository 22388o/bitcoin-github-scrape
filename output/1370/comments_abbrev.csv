Diapolo,2012-05-22T12:43:33Z,"The global is used by the GUI Debug window and IS present in the current code. It only moved from clientmodel.cpp to util.cpp, to allow usage in the debug.log entry.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1370#issuecomment-5845951,5845951,

sipa,2012-05-22T21:04:11Z,I don't see why you need a global for this? You only use it once...\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1370#issuecomment-5858857,5858857,
TheBlueMatt,2012-05-22T21:06:03Z,"I think its beneficial, and have no problem with it in general, my point was simply to remove the global definitions, and replace the single use in init.cpp with a call to GetTime().\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1370#issuecomment-5858905,5858905,

laanwj,2012-05-23T15:59:59Z,Doesn't Qt have it's own format time function? There's no need to put this in clientmodel as this requests nothing from the client.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1370#discussion_r868647,868647,src/qt/clientmodel.cpp

laanwj,2012-05-23T16:16:31Z,"Ah I get it. I guess you want to store the time when the ClientModel is created. Better to add a QDateTime field to the structure, fill it in the constructor, then return that?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1370#discussion_r868791,868791,src/qt/clientmodel.cpp
Diapolo,2012-05-23T16:20:41Z,"I would say it's even sufficient to add the time once in the RPCConsole constructor, via `ui->startupTime->setText(QDateTime::fromTime_t(GetTime()).toString());`, or should that stay in `RPCConsole::setClientModel()`?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1370#discussion_r868833,868833,src/qt/clientmodel.cpp
laanwj,2012-05-23T16:24:56Z,"IMO it should stay in ClientModel. Don't put such state in views, better not to rely on it that RPCConsole is created once at the beginning of the program and kept around forever.

laanwj,2012-05-23T16:57:45Z,Yeah that's fine... though officially it'd be better to return a datetime as that leaves formatting to the view instead of the model... in this case this is the same as we do for the other datetimes. It's only a minor thing anyway.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1370#discussion_r869209,869209,src/qt/clientmodel.cpp
