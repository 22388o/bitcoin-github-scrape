jonasschnelli,2016-07-18T05:58:22Z,Yes. We can try to merge this once we split of the masterbranch and had increase the version.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8343#discussion_r71102325,71102325,src/wallet/wallet.h
laanwj,2016-07-18T07:08:50Z,"Yes using the client version here is not very nice, if we had a dedicated wallet version constant this problem could have been avoided, as it could have been bumped at the moment HD support was introduced instead of arbitrary delineation based on release-process constraints.\n\nBut for now that's the best solution.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8343#discussion_r71106179,71106179,src/wallet/wallet.h
