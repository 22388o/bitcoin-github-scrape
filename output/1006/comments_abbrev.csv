Diapolo,2012-03-29T06:40:13Z,"It's fun, I can contribute and don't need a deep understanding of all the undelying protocol code :). By the way, if 0.6 gets released, will the commits be accepted directly after? It seems there is currently a commit stop during the release phase. I'm asking because that's the first time im somehow involved or affected by this and it's exiting!\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1006#issuecomment-4797759,4797759,
laanwj,2012-03-29T07:28:21Z,"As I understand it: if no blocking new issues arise we want to generate a 0.6.0 final from master, which is the same as 0.6.0.5 except the version number. So we can't pull anything now.\n\n(of course, we could make another branch and pull on that, but this is easier and hopefully the delay won't be too long)\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1006#issuecomment-4798241,4798241,
