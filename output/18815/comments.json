    "body": "> Worth noting that some effort was made previously to move logging to a separate\r\n> thread (#13200), though I think that implementation did do string interpolation\r\n> inline (synchronously). I had tried to move interpolation to the logging\r\n> thread, but the difficulty of __VA_ARGS__ and getting the right function\r\n> signatures deterred me; may be doable though.\r\n\r\nIs it? because `LogPrintf` accepts the inputs as references, so if you pass those to a thread and run `tfm::format` in that thread you might have a dangling reference or a data race here.",
