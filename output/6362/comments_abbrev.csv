laanwj,2015-07-02T15:42:54Z,"@jonasschnelli the code is moved from HTTPReq_JSONRPC to CRPCTable::execute, both is downstream from REST/HTTP selection, so RESTS cannot be affected. REST should do its own check and raise its own error, which has nothing to do with JSONRPCError.\n\nHere's the same check for REST: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/rest.cpp#L556\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6362#issuecomment-118073481,118073481,
