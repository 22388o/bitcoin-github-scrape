Agree with hebasto though that refactor PRs with the sole goal of line-shortening should be discouraged. (On the other hand, I think many reasonable refactorings _will_ as a side-effect lead to shorter lines.)\r\n\r\nFrom a practical point of view, I personally (and know many people who do) enjoy being able to view two source code files side-by-side without line breaks on a single modern screen, and while 80 is likely too low, decades after 80x25 terminals were widespread (there has been an interesting discussion on the Linux Kernel Mailing List about this subject: https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/5/29/1038), a soft-limit of 100 seems to be a good compromise here. If 100 is still too low for some, the absolute maximum should be a number that is still visible on a single screen without line breaks. Lines longer than 180-200 chars are absolutely inacceptable, IMHO. And unfortunately, we have many instances of those, especially in `src/validation.cpp`.\r\n\r\n> The primary issue I experience as a reviewer is reformatting of lines, especially function signatures or function calls, to make lines shorter. It adds churn, obfuscates the diff and makes review more fatiguing, difficult and error-prone than it otherwise needed to be.\r\n\r\nTend to agree with jnewbery here, that this can be solved by right usage of the diff-tool. In an ideal world the creator of commit would always put review options suggestions in a commit message where the regular diff is hard to read. This is happening already, e.g. \"best reviewed with -w --color-moved=...\" etc. The drawback is that this doesn't work with the rendered diff online on github, but this shouldn't be encouraged anyways.\r\n\r\nIn the long term, after this rule will roughly be followed for quite some time, if there is still many instances where changes introduce line-breaks, there is more likely something wrong with the code. I don't think that having lots of functions/methods with 5+ parameters is desirable. Hence I would hope that in the long-term, with this rule applied the functions/methods are designed in a way that most calls would still likely fit in a single line.",

    "body": "@jonatack: Hm, I see your point of view. Though it's very reviewers-centric and not taking into account potential new contributors which could also be turned off just by seeing those long lines. (And overly huge function/method bodies, but that's another topic...)\r\n\r\nI think in cases like #20788 where really lots of those line-breaks occur, the root of the problem is that stylistic changes and logical changes are mixed in one. It would make sense to first have an isolated commits that solely refactors the line-breaks, which could in theory be verified automatically (not sure if such a tool already exists, but I think it could be possible to \"normalize\" all white-space in two source files and then compare if they are still identical) and then based on this do the actual function signature changes. Reviewing the logical change would then be a piece of cake.\r\n\r\nFor example, instead of having a single commit that suffers from your described problem:\r\n```diff\r\n-static bool Socks5(const std::string& strDest, int port, const ProxyCredentials *auth, const SOCKET& hSocket)\r\n+static bool Socks5(const std::string& strDest,\r\n+                   int port,\r\n+                   const ProxyCredentials* auth,\r\n+                   const Sock& sock)\r\n```\r\nyou would have a pure-line-break-refactor (potentially machine-verified) commit (1/2)\r\n```diff\r\n-static bool Socks5(const std::string& strDest, int port, const ProxyCredentials *auth, const SOCKET& hSocket)\r\n+static bool Socks5(const std::string& strDest,\r\n+                   int port,\r\n+                   const ProxyCredentials *auth,\r\n+                   const SOCKET& hSocket)\r\n```\r\n\r\nand then a logical human-verified commit (2/2) that focusses on the actual signature changes\r\n```diff\r\n static bool Socks5(const std::string& strDest,\r\n                    int port,\r\n-                   const ProxyCredentials *auth,\r\n-                   const SOCKET& hSocket)\r\n+                   const ProxyCredentials* auth,\r\n+                   const Sock& sock)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat's just an idea, don't know if it's worth chasing it further. My point is that it's not an absolute unavoidable consequence of proposed line-length limits that there _has_ to be churn. Like already described in a previous comment, I'd assume that the changes get less and less painful for reviewers once the first line-shortening is done. For newly written code, exceeding the line limit too much will serve as kind of a warning sign that the code structure is likely flawed and should be reconsidered.",
