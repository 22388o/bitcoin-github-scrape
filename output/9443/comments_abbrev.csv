laanwj,2017-01-12T11:01:11Z,"Concept ACK, but due to the non-localized changes required to core code my opinion is that it is too risky to include in 0.14, given that it just fixes the fork check. I'd prefer to merge this after the 0.14 split-off.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9443#issuecomment-272135316,272135316,
luke-jr,2017-01-12T16:48:57Z,"To actually fix the warning system, we need to avoid banning peers that give us invalid blocks. Unfortunately, we currently also *rely* on that banning to ensure we have peers on the same network as us.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9443#issuecomment-272216241,272216241,
jl2012,2017-01-12T18:59:16Z,"@luke-jr we actually don't ban all types of invalid blocks. For example, violation of all softforks after P2SH are not banned. Also, with this PR it won't ban a node for sending header of a child of invalid block. As long as the PoW and timestamp are valid, the header chain will be followed.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9443#issuecomment-272250212,272250212,
rebroad,2017-03-13T10:23:37Z,@luke-jr there's a middle ground perhaps. set a maximum number of peers on different chains. ,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9443#issuecomment-286068172,286068172,
sdaftuar,2018-03-06T20:52:09Z,@sipa @jl2012 and I discussed this a bit in person. I think we should revisit this PR after we have better DoS protections in place against storing arbitrarily long headers chains.  (I plan to propose one potential solution to this soon.),https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9443#issuecomment-370923963,370923963,
fanquake,2018-04-26T12:59:47Z,Closing for now. This can be revisited in future as suggested by @sdaftuar.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9443#issuecomment-384632218,384632218,

jl2012,2017-03-08T18:50:34Z,yes. Maybe I could make the comments clearer,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9443#discussion_r104992389,104992389,qa/rpc-tests/forkwarning.py
