laanwj,2014-07-25T09:53:39Z,"I'm not sure it is an parameter that makes much sense to customize. Usually you'll either want full control over bootstrapping (-dnsseed=0), use DNS seeds when needed after a 'sane' delay (the default), or force DNS seed usage immediately (`-forcednsseed`, main use case faster debugging/troubleshooting of DNS seeds code).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4559#issuecomment-50129684,50129684,
