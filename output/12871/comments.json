    "body": "@MarcoFalke  I agree that the long-term plan should be to minimize the number of shell scripts. In the short-term I think it is a good idea to automate the mechanical part of the review process. That will allow for us scarce shell script reviewers to focus on the important stuff rather on trivial things that can be automated away using `shellcheck`.\r\n\r\nPersonally I run `shellcheck` manually on all shell scripts I review and ask for adjustments to please `shellcheck`. The recommendations given are very good and in line what a skilled human reviewer would suggest. My experience is that `shellcheck` is a really solid piece of linting software with a surprisingly low rate of false positives.",

Lower than most other language linters I've used. A very impressive piece of software.",
