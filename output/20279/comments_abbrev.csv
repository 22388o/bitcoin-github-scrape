theStack,2020-11-01 19:35:08,"Good idea! Particularly I think `getblockchaininfo` should not be used here, as it only shows the chainwork for the _last_ block, i.e. it is not useful for potential reviewers of the updated parameters. Maybe refer to `getblockheader` RPC but also add a note to `getblockhash` in parantheses, as this is useful to convert block height to block hash?
