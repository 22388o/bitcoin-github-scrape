promag,2018-05-16T15:02:00Z,Remove `ReadBestBlock` and `WriteBestBlock` from `TxIndexDB` definition.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13243#discussion_r188659758,188659758,src/txdb.h
promag,2018-05-16T15:02:43Z,A comment explaining this base class would be nice.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13243#discussion_r188659976,188659976,src/txdb.h
promag,2018-05-16T15:07:49Z,How about `index/baseindex.h`? (base.h a little vague even in folder index),https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13243#discussion_r188661723,188661723,src/Makefile.am
promag,2018-05-16T15:09:06Z,Why is this being changed?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13243#discussion_r188662182,188662182,src/init.cpp
jimpo,2018-05-16T18:25:11Z,"I tend to dislike filenames that are redundant with their directories, but I'll change if people prefer.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13243#discussion_r188726474,188726474,src/Makefile.am
jimpo,2018-05-16T18:26:09Z,"I think it makes sense for the DB to be encapsulated in the index interface, even if it is implemented separately internally.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13243#discussion_r188726823,188726823,src/init.cpp
jimpo,2018-05-16T18:27:03Z,"Given that it gets moved to BaseIndex for better context in ""index: Move index DBs into index/ directory."", would you still find the comment helpful?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13243#discussion_r188727103,188727103,src/txdb.h
jimpo,2018-05-16T18:31:52Z,"Good catch, thanks.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13243#discussion_r188728759,188728759,src/txdb.h
promag,2018-05-16T19:14:45Z,"Well I just think base is too vague. Also, there is `index/txindex.*`.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13243#discussion_r188741380,188741380,src/Makefile.am
promag,2018-05-16T19:16:21Z,"Agree with being encapsulated. It's just a unrelated change AFAIU, but a nice to include.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13243#discussion_r188741804,188741804,src/init.cpp
promag,2018-05-16T19:17:56Z,"Right, ignore then.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13243#discussion_r188742223,188742223,src/txdb.h
jimpo,2018-05-16T21:21:06Z,"Oh, sorry. The reason is that the `TxIndex::DB` is protected now (at the end of the commit series), so can't be independently instantiated in init.cpp.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13243#discussion_r188776660,188776660,src/init.cpp
jamesob,2018-05-18T14:22:48Z,"I find this name a bit confusing (""if we're not synced and this method is called `BlockUntilSynced...`, why are we returning?""). Would a rename to `m_initial_sync_complete` or something along those lines make sense or does that seem too wordy?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13243#discussion_r189284854,189284854,src/index/base.cpp
jimpo,2018-05-18T17:52:53Z,"Yeah, I see your point. I'm fine changing the variable name to be more descriptive `m_initial_sync_complete` or `m_sync_complete` both make sense to me (though the latter may not alleviate the confusion).",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13243#discussion_r189346381,189346381,src/index/base.cpp
jamesob,2018-05-25T14:41:02Z,Personally I think `base.h` is fine.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13243#discussion_r190915658,190915658,src/Makefile.am
