Also it's in the pull request description because it's the best description in my opinion except if you have a more generic name to reference debian/ubuntu operating systems i'd be happy to change that too.\r\n\r\nAlso keep in mind that I made this script for my personal needs and just wanted to share it, if you are not comfortable with the idea of merging it in the project it's fine for me.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n",

    "body": "> Thanks for your contribution. However the systemd service file _should_ work on Ubuntu. If it does not at this time for you, it would be good to fix that.\r\n> \r\n> I don't think including an old sysv-style init script is the right solution. Systemd contains some fallbacks to support this but that's at most a temporary situation, I suspect.\r\n\r\nYou can't adapt the existing script to work on any operating system using Systemd, for example the script bitcoind.init uses the file /etc/init.d/functions to get generic initialization functions which is specific to Redhat and doesn't exist on Debian/Ubuntu.\r\nDepending on the operating system you want to support you can replace the existing script by mine, or reject my merge request.",
