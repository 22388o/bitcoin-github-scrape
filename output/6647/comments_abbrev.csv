jonasschnelli,2015-09-07T11:50:57Z,nit: would a `enum` not be more adequate for a such operation?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6647#discussion_r38855960,38855960,src/utilstrencodings.h
jonasschnelli,2015-09-07T11:54:15Z,"Instead of the slightly static rule parameter, would a charset represented as string with additional forbidden chars not be more flexible.\nInstead `SanitizeString(""Comment2 .,_?@"", SAFE_CHARS_UACOMMENT)` it would then be `SanitizeString(""Comment2 .,_?@"", ""/:()"")`. \nNot sure if we wan't to have use case specific handling within `SanitizeString()`.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6647#discussion_r38856170,38856170,src/utilstrencodings.cpp
laanwj,2015-09-08T14:32:51Z,"+1 for using enum. This is a perfect fit for one.\n\nNot sure passing in the characters in a string is better. The idea makes sense, but having it like this keeps open the possibility of optimizing SanitizeString to use something else than string.find() on every character.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6647#discussion_r38932377,38932377,src/utilstrencodings.h
