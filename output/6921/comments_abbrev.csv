MarcoFalke,2015-10-31T09:13:53Z,Do we care about white space in comments? @laanwj said this will break `git blame`.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6921#issuecomment-152717128,152717128,
Diapolo,2015-10-31T09:16:33Z,"Sometimes I'm asking myself, why it seems just my trivial pulls create controversial discussions ^^.\n@MarcoFalke If this gets NACKed in general, fell free to pick it up.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6921#issuecomment-152717205,152717205,
laanwj,2015-10-31T09:51:46Z,"> Sometimes I'm asking myself, why it seems just my trivial pulls create controversial discussions ^^\n\nBecause, to be entirely honest, all this trivial fudging around with spaces tends to annoy me as long as there are still 341 actual issues to be solved.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6921#issuecomment-152719146,152719146,
btcdrak,2015-10-31T10:39:40Z,"I think what would help going forward is to have some sort of simple CS checker as part of the continuous integration like travis, then less CS issues would get into the codebase in the first place.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6921#issuecomment-152721693,152721693,
MarcoFalke,2015-10-31T08:59:25Z,I did not touch this last time because the translation was already done. Am I wrong?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6921#discussion_r43569771,43569771,src/init.cpp
Diapolo,2015-10-31T09:03:39Z,"IMHO your changes with removing the ""Error:"" in front require a few re-translations, so that shouldn't matter.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6921#discussion_r43569797,43569797,src/init.cpp
MarcoFalke,2015-10-31T09:08:54Z,"Right, ACK on this one.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6921#discussion_r43569827,43569827,src/init.cpp
MarcoFalke,2015-10-31T09:09:53Z,This would trigger new translations? So I'd NACK this one.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6921#discussion_r43569831,43569831,src/init.cpp
MarcoFalke,2015-10-31T09:59:55Z,@Diapolo Maybe just get in this change? You can either force push it or wait until I submit my trivial branch (~every two weeks) with the trivial changes cherry-picked and bundled up.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6921#discussion_r43570167,43570167,src/init.cpp
