laanwj,2011-10-17T19:34:06Z,"ACK (though see my line comment above, now we're setting text for the labels in both the code and the ui xml, which means it shows up twice in translations)\n\nAlso, I'd appreciate if you ""rebase -i"" this into two commits, one for the Swedish translation and one for the capslock detection.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/585#issuecomment-2433614,2433614,
ghost,2011-10-17T22:22:27Z,"Oh dear, I messed it up badly :(. Can I fix this somehow? I don't really understand the rebase -i command. Some advice would be very appreciated.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/585#issuecomment-2435596,2435596,
laanwj,2011-10-18T05:23:36Z,"If you have a merge in the middle, that makes rebase -i work very counter-intuitively. See also: http://notes.envato.com/developers/rebasing-merge-commits-in-git/\n\nLuckily, it seems that the changes itself were not affected. If you don't manage to fix it I'll handle this after the merge window for 0.5.1 starts.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/585#issuecomment-2438171,2438171,
laanwj,2011-11-13T08:30:12Z,"I've included this into my ui-next branch ( https://github.com/laanwj/bitcoin-qt ) and it will be merged after next release.\n\nThis does not include the swedish translation, which I cannot merge as it seems that the file changed under you. Maybe Transifex can help here: https://github.com/laanwj/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/translation_process.md\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/585#issuecomment-2721327,2721327,
