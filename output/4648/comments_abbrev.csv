Michagogo,2014-08-22T13:34:36Z,"I asked this 15 days ago and didn't get an answer. @fanquake, Was the Qt dependency version in the Windows build intentionally not bumped? I've seen that usually the Qt dependency is bumped when the OpenSSL build is, and the OS X Qt was, in fact, bumped. 0.9.3rc1 just got tagged with this upgrade and no bump, and I want to know if that was intentional or an oversight.\n\nEdit: Never mind, @laanwj ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4648#issuecomment-53060613,53060613,
