rmckay,2014-08-12T16:33:07Z,Fair enough.. I'll just say that I run the whatismyasn.org site and am committed to keeping it running on that IP.. might be an ok temporary solution until peer based IP detection is working.. but no worries if you don't want it.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4686#issuecomment-51939966,51939966,
cdecker,2014-08-13T09:39:45Z,Removing the lookup altogether seems a far better alternative. The external IP lookup is even more intrusive than the DNS seeds for which we started mandating certain logging policies.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4686#issuecomment-52028100,52028100,

cdecker,2014-08-13T09:50:12Z,@laanwj saw the branch on IRC and I'd like to test it. Currently I can only provide code review since I don't have access to a machine where I can run bitcoind from.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4686#issuecomment-52028985,52028985,
