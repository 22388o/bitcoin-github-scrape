In any case, I don't think that this will occur often, because with `MAX_PCT_ADDR_TO_SEND = 23` it would mean that an honest peer would need to have a really small addrman with less than 50 addresses  to send such a small response - usually, GETADDR responses should be considerably larger.\r\n\r\nRegarding your scenario:\r\nI think this is a very interesting scenario and probably worth addressing (V's address  could still be part of a GETADDR response though, even if it not forwarded).\r\nI don't see though how this PR helps with this even a little. On current master, `fGetAddr` is set in the VERSION processing with an outbound peer, and immediately unset as soon as we get a single ADDR with size < 1000 from the peer (and can never be set again for the duration of the connection) - while your scenario entails repeated messages.\r\n ",

    "body": "> since #5419, we do not get more than one ADDR message in response to GETADDR because vAddrToSend cannot have more than 1000 elements.\r\n\r\nIf I'm understanding you correctly, you're saying that we can't get more than one ADDR message in response because our own software wouldn't do it.  But what about other software on the network?\r\n\r\nAt any rate, I think the reason we have this variable is to track whether an ADDR message is likely in response to a getaddr message we send, in which case we don't want to relay the learned addresses to other peers, or if an addr message is an unsolicited relay from our peer, in which case we also want to try to relay.  (The reason to not relay messages with more than 10 entries is to rate limit the addr relay, so that a spammer can't use up all the network's bandwidth by blasting out addr messages.)\r\n\r\nI think one downside to relaying getaddr responses is a privacy leak - if you started up with a small addrman, and learned only a small set of nodes to connect to from one peer (and relayed that whole thing to another peer), that other peer might have a pretty good idea of who you're going to be connecting to.\r\n\r\nAnyway I'd be hesitant to remove this bool without talking through how we view this scenario, as it seems odd to me to relay addresses that are in response to a getaddr message, since we expect those to be of a very different nature than unsolicited addresses being relayed to us, which you expect to be originating with some peer announcing itself.  (I wish the response to a getaddr was a different message type than an unsolicited address being relayed to us!)",

(if I'm understanding the role of `nRelayNodes` correctly), including Node C \r\n\r\nand then your concern is at this point, that Node C is able to deduce private information? the connection between Node A and Node B? or more generally what Node A's options for connections are?

So, this flag doesn't even do what it was introduced for. Strong ACK on improving the comments/logic here, but I also still think removing it entirely is fine. Our \"don't relay getaddr responses\" logic is enforced by the `vAddr.size() <= 10` clause.",

    "body": "To elaborate on my last comment: The typical behavior seems to be that in the first `SendMessages()` loop after being successfully\u00a0connected, our peer will self-advertise (because\u00a0`m_next_local_addr_send == 0`  initially) and send us an ADDR without further delay\u00a0 (because\u00a0`m_next_addr_send == 0` initially), sending the GETADDR response later. It probably depends on the timing of when the VERACK vs. GETADDR messages are received by our peer, but from my node logs, this is the order of events in almost all cases.\r\n\r\nSo I think that there are now two separate issues:\r\n1.) Considering that this\u00a0flag mainly prevents initial self-announcements from being gossip-relayed and seems to have little to no interaction with GETADDR: Should we embrace this unintended change in behavior and rename the flag to `fDontRelayInitialSelfAnnouncements` or similar? As\u00a0@naumenkogs above, I don't really see a good reason to\u00a0do this.\r\n\r\n2.)\u00a0Even though `fGetAddr` doesn't seem to work as intended, @sdaftuar's privacy concerns still poses the question if there should be some mechanism suppressing relay of GETADDR answers beyond the `vAddr.size() <= 10 `limit. I think that it should be an extremely rare event for our outbound peer to have an addrman with < 43 addresses. Even starting with an empty addrman and querying some DNS seeds should get us over that limit, which should be no issue after having completed the first GETADDR interaction with a typical outbound peer. So I am not sure how realistic the scenario is.\r\n\r\nI think it might be more problematic for privacy _sending_ GETADDR responses < 1000, because we communicate the size of our addrman (via 23% factor) and signal that we might be susceptive to an eclipse attack if our addrman is small.\r\n\r\nI'll update the commit message and the PR description (will leave the originally assumed changes in behavior in for now, because they were quoted in this discussion).\r\n",

    "body": "So there are 2 issues pointed out by sdaftuar, I'd consider them separately:\r\n\r\n1. Privacy of a Bitcoin Core node with few AddrMan records making a new connection to a Bitcoin Core node.\r\nI agree with the concern, but according to mzumsande experiments above, the `fGetAddr` flag is ineffective here, so we already have this problem. The problem probably should be addressed in a different PR. If we can't come up with something better, we always can expand `ADDR` message to say it's unsolicited (not `GETADDR` response), I don't see any (privacy) issues with it.\r\n\r\n2. Some other software on the network. The right thing here would be to consider *all* more or less reasonable scenarios of the communication between our Bitcoin Core node and other software. For example, if that software don't self-advertise at all, it *will* actually get the privacy benefit described in (1), because `fGetAddr` flag won't be cleared on initial self-ad. Now, maybe that software relied on this privacy benefit? (I doubt though).\r\n\r\nI'm leaning towards reACK, but before that I'd rather us make some efforts to make sure (2) is not a concern (maybe an ML post is sufficient).",

    "body": "> I'm not 100% persuaded that fGetAddr better stays (the only valid justification I see at the moment is potentially breaking other software?), but I think this idea would make the flag work as intended.\r\n\r\nIt seems like it should be a reasonably good guess that if you send someone a `getaddr`, the next `addr` you get is probably in response.  However, since we send out a `getaddr` to outbound peers on connection, and because we send out an addr for ourselves to inbound peers, also usually on connection, we've created a natural race condition between nodes running our same software.\r\n\r\nFixing that race condition (usually) for our own software is pretty easy; and that then reduces the question posed by this PR to \"is it important to keep track of when an addr message is in response to a getaddr, or not?\"  And I tend to think that the answer is probably yes; although addr relay is not something specified in any BIPs, it makes sense to me that responses to a `getaddr` are of a different quality than general addr-relay, so we might as well try to detect those situations when reasonably possible and relay differently.  \r\n\r\nAs for what other software might exist: in addition to other full-node implementations out there, I think the dns seednodes can be used as addr-fetch peers by Bitcoin Core, in some situations?  I haven't tried to exercise it carefully, but my understanding is that the seednodes are custom software, which potentially differ from each other and from Bitcoin Core.\r\n",
