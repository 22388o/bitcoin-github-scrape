jonasschnelli,2021-01-04 08:26:06,"Nice!\nConcept ACK.\nCould we further reduce flushes by allowing a user parameter (`-pruneflushbuffer` [or similar])? Some users are probably okay with providing a few GBs of extra space for speeding up pruning (assume hight dbcache) (but wan't the extra space be freed after IBD).\nOr we could automatically use he dbcache size as the buffer size.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20827#issuecomment-753833331,753833331,
Sjors,2021-01-08 17:50:03,I also like the idea of temporally assigning more RAM for IBD. This could even be done by default for GUI users (with opt-out in the intro screen).,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20827#issuecomment-756904825,756904825,
luke-jr,2021-01-08 18:33:07,`dbcache` adjustments are ultimately an unrelated feature. I see #19873 as the next step in that area.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20827#issuecomment-756926008,756926008,
