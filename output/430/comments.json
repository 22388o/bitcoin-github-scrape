My version is already in my 4diff patches, just not suitable for merge. And there's also a version of the RPC fixes already as a pull request (#214).\n",

I think it benefits the safety and stability of the system as a whole if mining pool operators don't have to maintain a large number of patches, each with associated risk, from mainline.\n",

I agree it doesn't belong in util but in rpc.\n- Faster Base64 decoder: using inline code vs. using a library is always a controversial issue, but this is simple enough imho to do internally, after some correctness tests. It doesn't follow the coding standards though, btw.\n- Optimize generation of hex output on 'getwork' requests: if you're able to write a faster version for converting to Hex, would it be possible to use it as a base for replacing the current HexStr() entirely? I don't think we need several pieces of code doing the same thing.\n",

    "body": "I was hoping this thread had to do with optimizing the load time of the GUI. On windows 7 x64 it takes a minimum of 30 seconds on my mining rig. It can take longer than a minute on my laptop, and sometimes doesn't load on either.\n\nThis is a major inconvenience when you want to use Bitcoins to pay for a pita at Meze grille. Frustrating enough that people testing out the Bitcoin concept might walk away entirely.\n\nStronger mining is null if we don't have people spending the Bitcoins.\n\nEDIT:\n\nIf there is a demand for changes particular to pool operators, perhaps we can offer an alternative repo with optimizations for pooled mining? I think the further we go with the Bitcoin core, the more apparent the different needs between these two distinct groups of client-downloaders.\n\nAFAIK, some pool operators run their own optimized versions of the client. At some point it might be wise to conglomerate their efforts. Keeping a pool client and a standard client will IMHO allow for greater innovation, and less compromise.\n\nForgive me if this is an optimization that all clients would need in order to be effective, TBH I don't really know what it does...\n",
