promag,2017-10-09T08:44:02Z,IMO remove 2nd commit.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11465#issuecomment-335097129,335097129,
MarcoFalke,2017-10-09T08:56:50Z,"why?\n\nCould squash, though.\n\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#squashing-commits",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11465#issuecomment-335099929,335099929,
MarcoFalke,2017-10-09T08:59:46Z,@promag It nicely proves that the documentation now matches the named args,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11465#issuecomment-335100546,335100546,
promag,2017-10-09T09:01:01Z,The first commit does what the PR title states. No need to change the test to use named arguments. This is obviously my opinion!,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11465#issuecomment-335100852,335100852,
promag,2017-10-09T09:02:48Z,"No, the test does not prove that, to prove that we should assert the documentation string.\n\nAgain consider my comment above a nit.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11465#issuecomment-335101232,335101232,
promag,2017-10-09T09:04:52Z,There must be a test to assert argument order too :) (although that is probably in other tests).,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11465#issuecomment-335101674,335101674,
dusty-wil,2017-10-09T10:54:13Z,@MarcoFalke @promag I can remove the second commit if you'd prefer! Is there a neat way to do that through github or do I need to re-commit with the changes?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11465#issuecomment-335124305,335124305,
promag,2017-10-09T11:15:24Z,"For reference, this was missed in #8811 (9adb4e1).\n\n@dusty-wil to remove the commit you must push again. But do not remove it now, wait for more comments.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11465#issuecomment-335128582,335128582,
