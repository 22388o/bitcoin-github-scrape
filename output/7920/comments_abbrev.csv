theuni,2016-04-21T04:52:00Z,"Note that the build failed because we currently have a (different) special flag on our repo that force-routes us to the legacy infrastructure for caching. This change will disable that in favor of the new testing flag.\n\n(It may sound convoluted, but this change moves us one step closer towards being a normal repo. Once the caching feature is out of beta, there will be nothing special about us.)\",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7920#issuecomment-212742914,212742914,

theuni,2016-04-21T06:08:14Z,"@MarcoFalke Just for the sake of being future-proof. It only uses the python2 one at the moment, but I believe the (your?) intention is to move the rpc tests to python3. Just doing python2 for now is fine by me if that's what you'd prefer. I was just saving some future head-scratching when builds fail after the switch.\n\nEdit: Looking at the diff, I now see why you asked.
