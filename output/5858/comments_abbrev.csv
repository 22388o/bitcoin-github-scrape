jonasschnelli,2015-03-06T08:39:16Z,"The QT behavior on mac will place menu action with string matching to ""config, options, setup, settings or preferences"" to the general application menu (at very left) and remove them from other menu positions (which is somehow weak IMO).\n\nCurrently i only added the `QAction::NoRole` role to the `showHelpMessageAction` action. It is might be discussable to add the ""NoRole"" to every ""standard menu",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5858#issuecomment-77524364,77524364,

Qt's autodetection of html/plaintext for labels can be annoying, but this is a few magnitudes worse. The moral of the story is to leave as little a possible to defaults. Explicitly setting the role for all actions makes sense (if I remember correctly it also helps accessibility as screen readers and such use the info).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5858#issuecomment-77825061,77825061,
