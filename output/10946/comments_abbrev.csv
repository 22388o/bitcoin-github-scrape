sipa,2017-07-28T05:34:40Z,It only gives it you for the tip. `getchaintxstats` works for any block.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10946#issuecomment-318564339,318564339,
jnewbery,2017-07-29T23:34:25Z,What's the reason for wanting chainwork for any arbitrary block? Are you expecting to use nMinimumChainWork and defaultAssumeValid from the same block? Or is it so you can verify you have the exact same value as someone else who's run the release process?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10946#issuecomment-318866565,318866565,
sipa,2017-07-29T23:53:59Z,"@jnewbery Yes, ability to repeatably come up with the same numbers, even if the exact value doesn't matter.\n\nThis probably belongs more in `getblockheader` than in `getchaintxstats`, as it's not really a statistic about transactions.

achow101,2017-07-30T00:05:06Z,`getblockheader` already includes the chainwork for a block.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10946#issuecomment-318867830,318867830,
