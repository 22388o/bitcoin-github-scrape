harding,2018-11-12T17:28:09Z,"I think this is fine, but I do think it would help keep the length of the overall release notes more reasonable by shortening this particular news item down to a single bullet point by simply mentioning the bare essentials and then linking to https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/zmq.md#usage\n\nI'm happy to do that myself when I make another notes update in early December.\n\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14704#issuecomment-437964369,437964369,
