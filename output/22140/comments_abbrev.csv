sipa,2021-06-05 17:34:03,"I'm not convinced this is an improvement. Sure, it's a trivial function, but by having it this way there is symmetry with the V2 version of this function (I assume that was the reason for writing it this way).",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22140#issuecomment-855271123,855271123,

vasild,2021-06-09 14:26:33,"The reasoning is to have pairs of ser/unser functions, e.g. `SerializeFoo()` / `UnserializeFoo()` and have `UnserializeFoo(SerializeFoo(x)) == x`. This makes the code easier to verify visually and easier to modify - should one of those be altered, it is clear that a corresponding reverse mod should be applied to the other.\n\nWe currently have `SerializeV1Array()` which is not going away.
