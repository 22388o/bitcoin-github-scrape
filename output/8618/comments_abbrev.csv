rebroad,2016-08-28T09:19:53Z,"@sipa Now that you mention that, it makes sense - I mean, of course orphans aren't used.... which confuses me as Unlimited's code removes the line entirely (doesn't even make it dependent on misbehaviour). Any idea why they do this? Perhaps it helps with future blocks, i.e. not the very next one - or perhaps they found that orphans often find their parents when the block arrives, so it did signifi",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8618#issuecomment-242964794,242964794,

rebroad,2016-08-29T03:13:47Z,"@sipa @gmaxwell Thanks for the explanations. Ok, so I have only one question remaining regarding orphans, which is child pays for parent - how are these txs currently relayed? e.g. a parent has a fee below minrelayfee so doesn't get relayed, and child has a healthy fee above minrelayfee but is to most nodes an orphan - how are child pays for parent txs being reliably relayed currently?\n\nHopefull",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8618#issuecomment-243023379,243023379,
