    "body": "@sipa Now that you mention that, it makes sense - I mean, of course orphans aren't used.... which confuses me as Unlimited's code removes the line entirely (doesn't even make it dependent on misbehaviour). Any idea why they do this? Perhaps it helps with future blocks, i.e. not the very next one - or perhaps they found that orphans often find their parents when the block arrives, so it did significantly help reduce the amount of refetches needed. This makes sense to me also... which now makes your sentence make less sense to me - what do you mean when orphans are not used for compact block reconstruction? What if the block mined includes some of those orphans? It wouldn't use the ones already cached in memory?\n",

Ok, so I have only one question remaining regarding orphans, which is child pays for parent - how are these txs currently relayed? e.g. a parent has a fee below minrelayfee so doesn't get relayed, and child has a healthy fee above minrelayfee but is to most nodes an orphan - how are child pays for parent txs being reliably relayed currently?\n\nHopefully what happens is that the child is relayed closely followed by the parent - this way nodes can identify the parent as the parent of the child and relay it even if the fee is below minrelayfee.\n\nAnyway, I intend to close this pull for now as it does appear to be unnecessary but would enjoy hearing that the above functionality mentioned is already in the code.\n",
