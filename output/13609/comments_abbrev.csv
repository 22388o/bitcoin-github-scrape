MarcoFalke,2018-07-08T07:19:32Z,"Tend to NACK here for the comments given above. Imo, it would be more helpful if `contrib/gitian-build.sh` was rewritten to python to make it more user friendly. I don't see any increase in user-friendliness in this pull request as is.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13609#issuecomment-403268212,403268212,

laanwj,2018-07-09T13:02:38Z,"Agree with @marcofalke here on ~NACK. I think #13366 did the important changes here. We can forever keep creating PRs to change straggler occurrences in obscure places, but the added value is little compared to the overhead.\n\nAlso agree with converting `contrib/gitian-build.sh` to python.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13609#issuecomment-403470887,403470887,
