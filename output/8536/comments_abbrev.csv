luke-jr,2016-08-27T20:41:34Z,"utACK, seems reasonably safe. (The actual timeouts are unchanged, just the poll interval.)\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8536#issuecomment-242939645,242939645,
MarcoFalke,2016-08-27T21:51:39Z,"Correct. Actually, increasing the polling frequency increases the timeouts because you have to add the round trip time in each loop to get the ""real"" timeout.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8536#issuecomment-242942837,242942837,
laanwj,2016-09-21T12:33:39Z,Doesn't seem to result in any noticable speedup for me. With this patch:\n\n```\nALL                            | True   | 832 s (accumulated)\n\nRuntime: 243 s\n```\n\nWithout this patch:\n\n```\nALL                            | True   | 838 s (accumulated)\n\nRuntime: 237 s\n```\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8536#issuecomment-248598066,248598066,
