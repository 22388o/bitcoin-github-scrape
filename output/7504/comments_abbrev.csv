laanwj,2016-02-15T09:36:25Z,"BTW (no need to be in this PR) it would be nice to add a 'crystal clear' check to the test suite, could be interleaved with the current build process, just taking a snapshot of files here and there, then cleaning afterwards and checking:\n\n``` bash\n./autogen.sh\ngit ls-files -o > $TMPDIR/after_autogen.txt\n./configure\ngit ls-files -o > $TMPDIR/after_configure.txt\nmake \n...\nmake clean\ngit ls",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7504#issuecomment-184133259,184133259,
laanwj,2016-02-15T09:44:03Z,"Tested using this patch, and with the above steps. Only one snag:\n- `make clean` leaves behind one file that is not present after configure: `src/obj/build.h`, but this is cleaned up by `make distclean`, so may be a false positive\n\nACK, it solves the issue I raise in #7501\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7504#issuecomment-184135570,184135570,
theuni,2016-02-15T17:55:06Z,"@laanwj 'make distcheck' should do what you're after, i think? Been a while since I've tried it, I wouldn't be surprised if it's currently broken.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7504#issuecomment-184324037,184324037,
