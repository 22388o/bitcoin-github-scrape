laanwj,2021-02-25 08:30:36,"I'd agree that needing to have the wallet unlocked is a drawback.\n\nBut the thing is that the current output is not really useful for anything (I think). You could say it's not even a valid descriptor as it does a hardened dirivation from a `xpub`.\n\nE.g. like\n```\n    ""desc"": ""sh(wpkh(tpubD6NzVbkrYhZ4Yj6Abshu22tUGYKVK6xcazXuGmxRkLTqrMfpc6u7Bpr31wmqe8kJc7Y5ZCvKdvVRtsZhfB5hdLpUndFFc5mXat72",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21277#issuecomment-785716418,785716418,

achow101,2021-02-25 17:58:32,"The xpub cache should actually allow us to generate the normalized form without needing to unlock the wallet. After all, that is how we are able to refresh the address pool when the wallet is locked. However modifying the normalization function to do that may be an invasive change. I can look into doing that. Regardless, doing that would not materially effect this PR and I think it can be done in ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21277#issuecomment-786090997,786090997,
