According to #20160 we'll be supporting BDB wallets in some capacity for a few more years at least, I assume that means having some BDB documentation available? If we can delete it now I'm happy to do that, otherwise, I think consolidating it into a single, not front-and-center place is much better than having it spread out over the build docs, being",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23470#issuecomment-964013024,964013024,

However I think consolidating the legacy documentation is a worthwhile interim step, and will likely help with the migration towards sql based wallets, by moving the BDB documentation out of front and center. As is, the build docs for master don't do the best explanations for a first time builder / user.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23470#issuecomment-964138552,964138552,
