Taking the dump/KISS approach for now - one `[[nodiscard]] Wait()` and cast to `void` the callers that don't check the return value.\n\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21659#issuecomment-817835551,817835551,
practicalswift,2021-04-12 14:19:19,"Concept ACK\n\nRationale: Having the `[[nodiscard]]` annotation on `Wait` would have saved us from one uninitialized read historically. That's enough empirical evidence to convince me about the need for `[[nodiscard]]` here.\n\nThanks for addressing this!",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21659#issuecomment-817853060,817853060,
