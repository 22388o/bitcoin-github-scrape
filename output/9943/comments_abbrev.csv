jnewbery,2017-04-28T20:02:19Z,"I didn't change the imports in smartfees.py, bip9-softforks.py and bip65-cltv-p2p.py because there's no harm in leaving them as explicit. I only moved segwit.py from exlicit to wildcard because it was importing an absurdly long list of names.\n\nfor imports within the test_framework module itself, I think we should aim for them all to be explicit.

You're changing most of the places where this is being imported (smartfees.py and test_framework/address.py seem to be the only other ones). It might be worth just changing this, too.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9943#discussion_r112539547,112539547,test/functional/p2p-fullblocktest.py

My preference would be for utils.py to actually be pure utility functions and for the hash functions to live in there.\n\nI haven't moved it in this commit because that seemed the minimal change. We should move hash160 to live alongside the other functions in a future PR that cleans up utils.py and mininode.py.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9943#discussion_r114005573,114005573,test/functional/p2p-fullblocktest.py
