jgarzik,2015-05-27T19:40:35Z,"ut ACK - though I don't understand why we care about operators DoS'ing themselves...   Nobody should be sending any data, json or binary, straight from remote to the REST interface without sanitizing.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6193#issuecomment-106049326,106049326,
jonasschnelli,2015-05-27T19:47:18Z,I agree with @jgarzik. The nice side effect of this PR is that it harmonize the input scheme (avoid raw http post data and use `/rest/<command>/<parameter:1>/<parameter:n>.json` everywhere).\nAnd JSON as input format was a bad decision anyways (as output format it's totally fine IMO).\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6193#issuecomment-106050564,106050564,
jonasschnelli,2015-05-28T06:59:15Z,Travis issue (as well as in #6197 and #6198) is because of the failing native comparison tool (java). Hope someone can fix this soon.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6193#issuecomment-106201360,106201360,
laanwj,2015-05-29T11:04:59Z,"> avoid raw http post data and use /rest/<command>/parameter:1/parameter:n.json everywhere\n\nExactly. Providing parameters in the URI is what makes this interface more elegant, for simple queries like this.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6193#issuecomment-106775760,106775760,
