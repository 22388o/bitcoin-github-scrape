btcdrak,2016-02-15T11:23:38Z,What about `cltv_time` as in the `createmultisig` RPC?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7534#discussion_r52887526,52887526,src/wallet/rpcwallet.cpp

SelectCoins will need to be taught not to mix height and time locked coins, and FundTransaction to use time rather than height (preferably in more than merely cases that require it, for privacy). Note the code in this RPC call specifically blocks cltv_time for now.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7534#discussion_r52927431,52927431,src/wallet/rpcwallet.cpp
