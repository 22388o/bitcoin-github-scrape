laanwj,2015-06-29T15:35:20Z,"Concept ACK. Thanks for adding tests.\n\nHowever, wouldn't these be more appropriate in `src/qa/rpc-tests/rawtransactions.py`?\n\nI suppose it doesn't make much of a difference as this is a stateless utility function.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6350#issuecomment-116735304,116735304,
mruddy,2015-06-29T22:46:04Z,"@laanwj Thanks for the feedback. Yes, I suppose it would make sense to move these over into the python tests. They are more integration level tests anyways. I just did them this way because I had some other changes and could run everything with a single ""make check"". I'll look at moving these over later today or tomorrow.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6350#issuecomment-116872684,116872684,
mruddy,2015-06-30T14:01:18Z,@laanwj Updated -- I decided to use a separate new decodescript.py file to avoid muddling the existing rawtransactions.py. I also added a short snippet to the main README referencing this set of RPC tests.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6350#issuecomment-117195614,117195614,
