CryptoManiac,2017-03-01T00:40:56Z,"@jameshilliard Well, this also may be a viable solution. Unfortunately, some people are limited to Windows operating system. To handle connections, the NT version of nginx is currently using only select(), so it's very slow. :(",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9893#issuecomment-283207968,283207968,
CryptoManiac,2017-03-01T00:48:51Z,"@luke-jr Why not? If you have a walletless daemon, which listening at the private interface, then I'd say that nothing bad could happen. \n\nHowever, I understand the main idea.

laanwj,2017-03-03T14:42:31Z,"> Just for example, I have few instances of bitcoind which are being used as template sources for eloipool. Each getblocktemplate response has a size of ~2MB. Being gzipped it shrinks down to ~800KB, which is a fairly reasonable size. :)\n\nThis does increase the latency by bit, though, so on faster networks wouldn't want to use this.\n\nIn any case I agree that this belongs externally.

CryptoManiac,2017-03-03T15:35:40Z,"@laanwj It depends on your TCP/IP stack settings. In FreeBSD, for example, sometimes it's recommended to set net.inet.tcp.recvspace parameter to 8k. With such receive buffer size you can get a significant improvement even for a local instance of bitcoind, speed up looks like a linear function of compression ratio.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9893#issuecomment-283985772,283985772,

CryptoManiac,2017-03-03T15:40:25Z,"@jonasschnelli Because sometimes it doesn't help. Nginx needs to get the data from the upstream, so it can be affected by tcp/ip settings.
