Leviathn,2016-11-14T17:57:17Z,Thanks for the guidance - just getting into the swing of things..\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9158#issuecomment-260409968,260409968,
morcos,2016-11-14T18:03:54Z,@Leviathn I removed the functionality of estimate*priority in #7730.  I didn't think it was necessarily a good idea to remove the RPC call itself until it had been marked deprecated for a release.  I didn't know if there were external applications relying on those API calls at least returning something.\n\nWhat do others think?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9158#issuecomment-260411943,260411943,

Leviathn,2016-11-14T18:08:24Z,Not trying to step on your toes @morcos - I know fees are where you've been focusing on lately : I just saw an opportunity to contribute by removing what I see (i think obviously so) as useless functionality in a fee-saturated Bitcoin. \n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9158#issuecomment-260413133,260413133,
sipa,2016-11-14T18:12:56Z,"I think most people agree it's useless at this point, but we normally don't\nbreak RPC compatibility without deprecating it first.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9158#issuecomment-260414451,260414451,
morcos,2016-11-14T18:14:02Z,"@Leviathn I'm 100% in agreement that we should remove all the priority code.  I was going to suggest that as a topic for discussion in this weeks IRC development meeting.  Please join us.  I'm not sure if its a change that we'll get in for 0.14, but would be nice to agree we can move forward with it.\n\nThe RPC calls in particular though I thought we might leave around for backwards compatibility ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9158#issuecomment-260414771,260414771,
Leviathn,2016-11-14T18:16:54Z,"Ok - After reviewing #7730 it appears your clean-up there is comprehensive @morcos - so, i'll close this and reopen another PR for the Tests, QT, and Wallet xcode removals. I'll be happy to join you this week re - the Dev meet. \n\nI appreciate the quality feedback\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9158#issuecomment-260415559,260415559,
