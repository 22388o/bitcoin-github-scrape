laanwj,2017-09-07T20:39:21Z,Is this just a cleanup or does this result in crashes/misestimations?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11273#issuecomment-327921266,327921266,
morcos,2017-09-09T18:48:33Z,"@laanwj This is meant to just be cleanup.  The code to process the old file was left in under the thought we might provide a transition, but then we never did.  Which reminds me, we should mention in the release notes that upgrading starts your estimates over again.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11273#issuecomment-328296395,328296395,
TheBlueMatt,2017-09-11T16:45:44Z,There are also similar cleanups to be had in TxConfirmStats::Read.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11273#issuecomment-328588422,328588422,
Xekyo,2017-09-26T04:44:07Z,@jnewbery and I tested this at CDT. It will only refrain from loading estimation files created by the previous version as they are not compatible with the new estimation file.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11273#issuecomment-332084951,332084951,
jnewbery,2017-09-26T13:29:30Z,"@Xekyo care to respond to @TheBlueMatt's comment? There are a couple of if statements in `TxConfirmStats::Read` that are now redundant:https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/67879b7c443144e479c763f64abb9c1ed7e44eaa/src/policy/fees.cpp#L415 and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/67879b7c443144e479c763f64abb9c1ed7e44eaa/src/policy/fees.cpp#L444\nThis PR should also clean up that code.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11273#issuecomment-332198214,332198214,

laanwj,2017-12-19T16:03:44Z,"utACK 3a3a9f9\nI'm going to merge this. Removing this redundant code is clearly an improvement, and the other things suggested can be done later (added ""up for grabs"" tag).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11273#issuecomment-352803232,352803232,

laanwj,2017-09-07T22:41:00Z,I don't think so - on 0.15.0 it should be `150000` on master it should be `159900`,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11273#discussion_r137672601,137672601,src/policy/fees.cpp
