jgarzik,2012-09-25T19:17:28Z,"NAK, this breaks existing setups (it's in released 0.7), and further it forces anybody wanting the raw form to perform extra parsing.\n\nDecomposition into readable form is an extra step, see e.g. ""decoderawtransaction"" RPC\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1867#issuecomment-8866614,8866614,
xblitz,2012-09-25T19:28:39Z,Agreed about breaking existing setups.. maybe we can just add an address property instead\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1867#issuecomment-8866980,8866980,
jgarzik,2012-09-25T19:29:29Z,"just use decoderawtransaction, that is why it's there ;p\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1867#issuecomment-8867012,8867012,
xblitz,2012-09-25T19:42:20Z,meaning to find the addresses of the output it we need to do a getrawtransaction and then a decoderawtransaction for each output ..  so why are the amounts and confirmations displayed.. you can also get them from decoderawtransaction ;p\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1867#issuecomment-8867442,8867442,
gavinandresen,2012-09-25T20:11:21Z,"You don't need to getrawtransaction then decoderawtransaction, you can do both of those in one step by passing '1' as the second argument to getrawtransaction.  And if you have a bunch of transaction ids you can use the new 'batch' JSON-RPC support to do it all in one round-trip.\n\nClosing.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1867#issuecomment-8868411,8868411,
