Choosing a larger value means that a node can recover from larger reorgs; however the minimum value of 550MiB is designed to allow for reorgs up to 288 blocks (~2 days).\n\nIf there happened to be a reorg that required more data on disk than the user had (very unlikely) then the user's node will crash, and the user would have to restart the node with -reindex.  In the case of a node that was pruned, running -reindex will cause the node to delete all the data on disk, which can't (currently) be used by bitcoind when doing a -reindex.  So in particular the user will end up redownloading the whole blockchain in such a scenario (the amount re-downloaded will not depend on the value passed to -prune -- unless somehow the user selects a value large enough that all the block files remained on disk and no pruning actually took place).\n\nRather than try to re-explain pruning here, maybe it would make sense to refer readers back to the 0.11.0 release notes?  I don't know how easy that is to link to I guess.\n",

Fixed by 54d390780feaef895fede8da3f436b932af29c1d\n\nWith regards to the multiple options of resolving this, here's what I decided:\n\n> Rather than try to re-explain pruning here, maybe it would make sense to refer readers back to the 0.11.0 release notes? I don't know how easy that is to link to I guess.\n\nI think it makes sense to explain it here for the usability purpose of having a self-contained document. However, linking the old release notes also is useful. So I just did both.\n\n> I agree this misunderstands things a bit. The minimum value is chosen to handle any realistic reorganization. Larger reorgs will be disastrous for many other reasons, so there's no need to even consider them here.\n\nIf the node can crash, that is worth mentioning at least? For example, it could cause financial loss for miners if their nodes shut down.\nTo find a tradeoff between your suggestion of not mentioning it at all, and the \"crash + reindex required\" information, I tried to keep it as neutral as possible by saying the node will \"shutdown\" (spelling of that word fixed in 15c0263ff1e4f4773005291e1eb584954900e197), and leaving out what has to be done afterwards. That both conveys the information that it won't work anymore, and allows leaving out what happens afterwards by not scaring the user off with a strong word such as \"crash\".\n\n> If you want to link to older release notes the best way, I think, would be to link to the historical release notes in master: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.11.0.md#block-file-pruning .\n> Alternatively you can link to the current release notes at the time of the v0.11.0 tag:\n> https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v0.11.0/doc/release-notes.md#block-file-pruning\n> These are probably the same but may potentially be missing some post-facto editorial fixes.\n\nWith regards to technical documentation, I think non-permanent links are an annoyance: They make it difficult to reconstruct what a user did read, since the document he saw will vary depending on when he accessed the link.\nSo I chose to link the tag.\nLuckily, the two files are binary equivalent currently anyway.\n",
