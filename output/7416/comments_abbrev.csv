sdaftuar,2016-01-26T15:13:20Z,"I think this is a confusing sentence.  Choosing a larger value means that a node can recover from larger reorgs; however the minimum value of 550MiB is designed to allow for reorgs up to 288 blocks (~2 days).\n\nIf there happened to be a reorg that required more data on disk than the user had (very unlikely) then the user's node will crash, and the user would have to restart the node with -reindex",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7416#discussion_r50846879,50846879,doc/release-notes.md
laanwj,2016-01-27T09:32:46Z,"I agree this misunderstands things a bit. The minimum value is chosen to handle any realistic reorganization. Larger reorgs will be disastrous for many other reasons, so there's no need to even consider them here.\n\nIf you want to link to older release notes the best way, I think, would be to link to the historical release notes in master: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/releas",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7416#discussion_r50959185,50959185,doc/release-notes.md

Fixed by 54d390780feaef895fede8da3f436b932af29c1d\n\nWith regards to the multiple options of resolving this, here's what I decided:\n\n> Rather than try to re-explain pruning here, maybe it would make sense to refer readers back to the 0.11.0 release notes?

sdaftuar,2016-01-27T15:19:40Z,"I would strike ""unless there is a hard fork"" from this sentence; hard forks shouldn't have much bearing on the likelihood of a 288 block reorg, and regardless it's sufficient to point out that large reorgs like this are very unlikely.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7416#discussion_r50997313,50997313,doc/release-notes.md
