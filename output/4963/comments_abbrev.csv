randy-waterhouse,2014-10-08T20:19:20Z,"I had a quick look at using some m4 to use our pkg.m4 only if the system copy doesn't exist but it will be messy.\n\nMy take on it is pkg-config is a hard build dependency like autoconf, automake, g++ or clang, etc. As such, it is a hard requirement that pkg-config needs to be installed correctly for a user to build bitcoin, i.e., we can't be expected to have fixes to work around for poor installs",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4963#issuecomment-58420491,58420491,
