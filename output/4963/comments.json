    "body": "I had a quick look at using some m4 to use our pkg.m4 only if the system copy doesn't exist but it will be messy.\n\nMy take on it is pkg-config is a hard build dependency like autoconf, automake, g++ or clang, etc. As such, it is a hard requirement that pkg-config needs to be installed correctly for a user to build bitcoin, i.e., we can't be expected to have fixes to work around for poor installs of these other build deps either.\n\nI see nothing special about OSX 10.6 versus 10.7, 8 and 9 that would make the pkg-config install behave functionally any different. Therefore most likely it is that around that time linux package installers for Darwin switched from primarily using Fink or Macports to Homebrew, and Fink uses different locations for base and build system installing. A mixture of base packages installed by Fink and Ports and Brew on the same system is a user choice/error.\n\nMaybe we could put the fix in as is and try to help the few users that might be affected to repair their old OSX 10.6 systems properly? I can hang-out on #bitcoin-build for support if necessary.\n",
