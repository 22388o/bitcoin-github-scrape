    "body": "@morcos points out that the cs_main holding at for the block's transaction's processing loop might interfere with all the fancy new fast block-response networking stuff we have going in 0.14. Sadly, because cs_main must come before cs_wallet, this isnt trivial to fix.\r\n\r\nOne easy fix is to add another cs_wallet - cs_wallet_before_main which is locked here to emulate the behavior prior to the lock split in #7946.",

    "body": "Thinking about it more, most of those things will not be running at that time anyway, because we only have one message processing thread. This may have adverse effects on miners who run with a wallet, but aside from that I dont think there is really all that much cs_main contention here (and certainly wouldn't be a regression from 0.13). We can add a cs_wallet_before_main when we split message processing thread.",
