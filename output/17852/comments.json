    "body": "Whoa i dunno what just happened. Was just adding a comment but i inadvertently hit \"close conversation\" not as if i know what that button does but everything disappeared. Good thing i always write everything in a text editor because I'm so used to Android killing my apps and taking my drafts with them i dont like any ux that just deletes what you were working on because you hit one button. People accidentally hit buttons all the time. Anyway back on subject:\r\n\r\nAh yes, was just able to verify that this patch does not in fact mysteriously fix the issue, so it remains mysterious at the moment.\r\n\r\nWhat happens is, if you interrupt bitcoind in the middle of a sync with txindex on, the next time you run it, the txindexer has suddenly seemed to have fallen many blocks behind where it was when you interrupted the first process, for whatever reason that is yet to be determined, but the chainstate is always properly synced and closed so there must be a hint in comparing how the two are used differently.\r\n\r\n So, when the txindex thread restarts it wastes a bunch of time indexing blocks it has already indexed, which you can tell because no new data is written to the leveldb until it catches back up since the keys and values in the txindex don't change. Will file a bug report if i can't find an existing one. \r\n \r\nI haven't seen any crashes or anything worse than wasting some time and disk i/o, so it's not a real big deal in the grand scheme of the txindexer's overall time, just slows down syncing when you do restart it until the indexer catches back up, so if you're frequently stopping and starting the sync like because you have a magnetic spinning disk and it's your only disk, it can get a little irritating. But then that's always irritating \ud83d\ude02 thanks for the info\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "@paulyc Oh, thank you, very nice catch. This is happening because the txindex (and the other indices) are stopped in `Shutdown` (init.cpp) before `ForceFlushStateToDisk` is called. `ForceFlushStateToDisk` triggers the `ChainStateFlushed` callback on the indices which commits the indexed state to disk. So probably the best solution is to move the index stops after that. Alternately, `BaseIndex::Stop` can just call `Commit` directly. Or do both, because I don't see a downside to either approach.",

Must not have had enough coffee or something when I submitted this, but glad it helped find the issue, which clearly had to be a little more complex. ;) In the immortal words of Samwise Gamgee all's well as ends well, or at least it will be when a working PR is merged. Not sure if I'll have time to do it soon, but it's been there long enough, it can wait a little longer and I can test it properly, (why they do the tests...), unless someone else has time to fit it in somewhere but I wouldn't know",

Will file a bug report if i can't find an existing one. \r\n \r\nI haven't seen any crashes or anything worse than wasting some time and disk i/o, so it's not a real big deal in the grand scheme of the txindexer's overall time, just slows down syncing when you do restart it until the indexer catches back up, so if you're frequently stopping and starting the sync like because you have a magnetic spinning disk and it's your only disk, it can get a little irritating. But then that's always irritating \ud83d\ude02 thanks for the info",
