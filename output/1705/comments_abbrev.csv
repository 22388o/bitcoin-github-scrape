laanwj,2012-08-23T15:51:26Z,"Agree @TheBlueMatt it's only a lukejr thing, it's fine with me to remove it.\n\nI remember some time ago there was a redesign that moved the tabs to the side; when there is a lot of space for tabs it makes sense to make even message signing, which is a rarely used feature, a tab in itself. But with so limited space for tabs it really makes no sense.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1705#issuecomment-7974204,7974204,

sipa,2012-08-23T17:53:26Z,"Please Luke, that's like claiming browsers need a proxy server bar as prominent as the search or URL bar. I'm sure various services use this, but making it so prominent just confuses people.
