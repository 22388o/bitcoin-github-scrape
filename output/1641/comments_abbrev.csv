This was tested successfully with a one-line pynode patch (pynode HEAD deb07f51435cd0d18596bddfee28e337a5a6454e).  pynode issues 'mempool' at startup, and fills its own mempool with the returned results.\n\n```\n--- a/node.py\n+++ b/node.py\n@@ -238,6 +238,7 @@ class NodeConn(asyncore.dispatcher):\n                        self.send_message(msg_verack(self.ver_s",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1641#issuecomment-7436355,7436355,

sipa,2012-08-13T15:44:54Z,"ACK on the changes, but maybe there must at least be some discussion about adding this, and the protocol version change involved. An alternative would be using a service bit (I don't personally think that is preferable), but people may have other opinions.\n\nI would expect the startup sequence to also send a mempool command to another node, in case it reports protocol version 60002 or higher?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1641#issuecomment-7695802,7695802,
