Diapolo,2012-06-14T14:25:19Z,I have a pull in the pipe that merges sign / verify message to a tabbed UI just like with the options dialog. Will open it later today or tomorrow ... perhaps we can talk about removing that unused stuff? Are there any comparison screens how it looks with that messaging stuff? That many #ifdefs for such a thing annoy me!\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1459#issuecomment-6329462,6329462,
