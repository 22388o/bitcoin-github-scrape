luke-jr,2015-12-26T21:52:26Z,Won't this detect the no-op obfuscation too? That wouldn't be a good idea...\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7259#issuecomment-167364961,167364961,
pstratem,2015-12-26T21:54:44Z,@MarcoFalke luke-jr is right you need to also check for the null obfuscation key\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7259#issuecomment-167365915,167365915,
MarcoFalke,2015-12-26T22:02:23Z,@pstratem Why would someone write a null obfuscation key?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7259#issuecomment-167367081,167367081,
pstratem,2015-12-26T22:04:48Z,"@MarcoFalke it's a quirk of how the obfuscation code works, it's XOR so a null obfuscation key is the same as no obfuscation key\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7259#issuecomment-167367159,167367159,
sipa,2015-12-26T22:06:53Z,Do we ever _write_ a null key? (as opposed to treating no key as null)\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7259#issuecomment-167367210,167367210,
MarcoFalke,2015-12-26T22:07:01Z,@pstratem But it  is never **written** to the db. This would be like saying I obfuscate every of my GitHub messages with the null obfuscation key. (It's redundant and not needed)\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7259#issuecomment-167367216,167367216,
pstratem,2015-12-26T22:18:59Z,@MarcoFalke I stand corrected\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7259#issuecomment-167368701,167368701,
laanwj,2016-01-04T08:06:03Z,"Concept ACK but doubting if this or #6919 makes more sense. \nSure, backporting the whole thing involves somewhat more code but it seemed more useful than introducing a little bit less of code to just warn.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7259#issuecomment-168606718,168606718,
MarcoFalke,2016-01-04T11:25:27Z,"@laanwj This can be cherry-picked to 0.10 without conflicts as well. As this issue seems popular ( https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/7258#issuecomment-167353533 ) we need either #7259 (this) or #6919, imo.\n\nKeep in mind you can rebase #6919 simply on a commit which reverts #7259 (this), in case you want to reopen after #7259 (this) got merged. (""'Don't Let Perfect Be The Enemy Of Good'"")",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7259#issuecomment-168651686,168651686,
laanwj,2016-01-05T10:44:44Z,"Yeah, this is fine for 0.11. It's easier to test that it rejects a database than to test whether it works.\n\nWould be nice to have at least one tested ACK, though.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7259#issuecomment-168968912,168968912,
