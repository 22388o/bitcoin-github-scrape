I'm fine with moving the check there, to be clear.\r\n\r\n> So would you suggest I should move isValidHostPort under the torcontrol.cpp file?\r\n\r\nNo, not really. If it's a generally useful utility function it makes sense to put it under `util`. Though `utilstrencodings.cpp` is somewhat debatable, it's network utility functionality not general number/string parsing.\r\n\r\nIt was more of a question of where to put the argument checking logic itself, with regard to responsibilities. Init shouldn't \"know\" the implementation details of everything. It's already a big mess in that regard. So you could add a function, say, `TorControlArgumentChecks` that calls `IsValidHostPort`, logs a message and returns the status, and call that from Init.\r\n\r\nBut I agree with @MarcoFalke 's solution.",
