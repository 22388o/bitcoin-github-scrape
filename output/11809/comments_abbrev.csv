Willtech,2018-02-27T10:24:12Z,"In v0.16.0rc4 on Windows-64 executable `bitcoin-qt.exe`, the default proxy port is `%2` ?\n\nI might suggest, if it is empty or not-a-valid-number, then just set the port to `9050`.\n\nAlso, the warning to restart client for changes to be effective does not seem to be displayed consistently, if the client needed to be restarted for any change.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11809#issuecomment-368822113,368822113,

laanwj,2017-12-04T16:44:42Z,"I intentionally (see the OP) do not add any extra validation in this pull.
