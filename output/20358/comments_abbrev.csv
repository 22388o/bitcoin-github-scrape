laanwj,2020-11-18 10:53:43,"The code change looks correct to me in any case.\n\nBut I'm surprised, uClibc doesn't have `getauxval` at all? It's a slight bit worrying to me because, besides random seeding, it's used for important kernel→userspace communication such as detecting what instruction sets are supported on ARM (and RISC-V and … probably many other architectures).",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20358#issuecomment-729600364,729600364,
