gstarnberger,2011-06-14T05:34:09Z,Instead of using EVP_BytesToKey for key derivation I think scrypt (https://www.tarsnap.com/scrypt.html) should provide a somewhat better security against brute-force attacks.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/232#issuecomment-1363969,1363969,
TheBlueMatt,2011-06-14T10:04:41Z,"@sysfrog Im not sure.  Though it may claim to be more secure, 1000 rounds on OpenSSL's algorithm is also very secure and I think I'd rather use a more common/well used/well analysed algorithm like OpenSSL's entire code base is.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/232#issuecomment-1364980,1364980,

dizzyd,2011-06-14T13:49:12Z,"re: the unused IV -- ""may be some kind of crazy issue.."" is not a logical argument. Being paranoid about security is good, but there needs to be some basis in reality for it. Otherwise, you wind up with a lot of code that doesn't do anything and may obscure what's _really_ going on. \n\nre: calls to SetKey mlocking -- if that's the case, then you _really_ don't need to copy it to vchKey.

enmaku,2011-06-16T16:50:29Z,"witkamp:\n\n> Is there a reason you are not using a random salt?\n\nYeah, password data should be salted - I mean we DO already have a giant network of people with high-end GPUs and the drivers/software necessary to brute force such things ;)\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/232#issuecomment-1382512,1382512,
gstarnberger,2011-06-16T17:13:56Z,"@TheBlueMatt As far as I understand scrypt the main advantage over older techniques is that it not only adds computational complexity to calculate a given key from a password, but that each calculation also requires a given amount of RAM. So it's much harder to parallelize an attack with, e.g., an ASIC, as you would need lots of RAM to do so.\n\nBut I agree with you: There have been much more revi",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/232#issuecomment-1382673,1382673,
TheBlueMatt,2011-06-16T17:24:32Z,"@witkamp mostly because it would be a pain to store.  This patch already uses the public key as the IV for the encryption of each private key so any kind of brute force/dictionary attack is already ridiculously difficult, I dont see a major advantage to adding a random salt to be used for a given wallet (and then stored in the wallet) as to brute force a wallet, you already need to know some of th",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/232#issuecomment-1382749,1382749,
enmaku,2011-06-16T17:30:53Z,"@TheBlueMatt gotcha, didn't see the public key = IV bit but it makes sense and stops dictionary/BF attacks at least as well as a random salt so I'm happy with it as a solution.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/232#issuecomment-1382789,1382789,

mutantmonkey,2011-06-21T02:09:36Z,"@phantomcircuit That attack is effective against 11-round AES-256, but not full 14-round AES-256. It'd be better to increase the number of rounds (he recommends 28 or more in that article) used instead of using a smaller key size. There are plenty of attacks on AES-128 as well, many of which were published after that article was written.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/232#issuecomment-1407446,1407446,
