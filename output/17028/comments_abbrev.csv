achow101,2019-10-03 00:08:18,"Concept NACK\n\nIMO `listunspent` should really only list UTXOs which are spendable as it's often used for manual coin selection. Changing this would mean that someone who is using `listunspent` to get UTXOs to pass into some other software that does coin selection could accidentally select a UTXO that is not spendable.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17028#issuecomment-537730974,537730974,
promag,2019-10-03 23:25:40,Agree with @achow101. Maybe clarify help text that immature unspents aren't returned?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17028#issuecomment-538166801,538166801,
andrewtoth,2019-10-04 18:19:38,"@achow101 I believe that is what the `unsafe` flag is for. So this rpc will already return potentially unspendable outputs by default, unless the include unsafe is explicitly set to false.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17028#issuecomment-538508060,538508060,
meshcollider,2019-10-07 23:50:11,"@andrewtoth unsafe is different from unspendable. Immature coinbase transactions are the latter. Waiting for X number of confirmations is a users choice based on their risk, but immature coinbase is not up to the user. Closing this as it has no agreement",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17028#issuecomment-539252414,539252414,
