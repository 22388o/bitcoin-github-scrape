Diapolo,2013-05-03T16:50:36Z,"Idea is good, but I dislike the fact that this is a) Mac only and b) we have that stuff as duplicate in `void BitcoinGUI::setClientModel(ClientModel *clientModel)`. Even on Windows we first have that normal tray icon and after loading it switches to testnet. I think it's worth to think about a better solution that covers all OSes and directly displays the correct icon.\n\nWe currently set the defa",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2614#issuecomment-17405344,17405344,

I think that is rather ugly ;) or at least not perfect ^^. So I asked for a global solution :).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2614#issuecomment-17431133,17431133,
