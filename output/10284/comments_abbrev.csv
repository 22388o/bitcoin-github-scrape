ryanofsky,2017-05-24T15:51:47Z,"Should make this const. Also maybe prefer to declare this as a `const char*[]` array, or as a function mapping enum values to strings, or as a function returning a static map. Global objects like this have constructors that need to run before main() and will cumulatively slow down program startup. Also because this is a static global in a header file, the constructor will run once for every .cpp f",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10284#discussion_r118291974,118291974,src/policy/fees.h

morcos,2017-06-08T20:46:52Z,It's meant to get logged even if you have not selected any debug log categories,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10284#discussion_r120994873,120994873,src/wallet/wallet.cpp
ryanofsky,2017-06-12T20:55:34Z,I don't think there's any benefit to making this const (cases where you do want this are pretty rare https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8716330/purpose-of-returning-by-const-value).,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10284#discussion_r121523797,121523797,src/policy/fees.h
