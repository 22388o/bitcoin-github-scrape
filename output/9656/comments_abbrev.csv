TheBlueMatt,2017-02-01T23:23:46Z,"It appears I throughly confused myself trying to test, again, but you can see an equivalent version (patched to work on my repo) clearly passing at https://travis-ci.org/TheBlueMatt/bitcoin/jobs/197481158",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9656#issuecomment-276816256,276816256,

MarcoFalke,2017-02-01T22:58:23Z,"Are you sure this is working. I could imagine gpg needs the keys first. Something like\n```sh\nwhile read line; do travis_retry gpg --keyserver hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv-keys $line; done < contrib/verify-commits/trusted-keys; fi\n```\n\nwould do it, but it might not be enough.
