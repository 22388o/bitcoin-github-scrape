MarcoFalke,2017-01-18T00:17:09Z,"This is currently tagged for 0.14, but seems not yet ready. (I blame myself for not taking a second look). \n\nGiven that it is mostly only a minor gui change,  I'd prefer to defer this and assign the 0.15 milestone?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9461#issuecomment-273343407,273343407,
jonasschnelli,2017-01-18T07:38:56Z,"Thanks @sipa for the review. Fixed all points.\n\n@MarcoFalke: We could postpone this for 0.15.\nThis – simple – PR together with the new modal overlay, does guide the user much better during the first startup. Connecting to peers and syncing the first headers can take a couple of seconds... during this stage, I think it would be great to show a minimal progress update.\n\nLet's try to get on",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9461#issuecomment-273404843,273404843,

jonasschnelli,2017-01-18T07:06:12Z,~~The boolean indicates whether the label was updated or not. This reduces redundant calls in `bitcoingui.cpp`. I'll document it a bit more.~~,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9461#discussion_r96577126,96577126,src/qt/bitcoingui.cpp
