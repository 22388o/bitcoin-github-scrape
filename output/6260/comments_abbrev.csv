jgarzik,2015-06-10T04:50:40Z,"hmmmm.  I agree w/ the theory.\n\nTo be practical, some sites either implicitly or explicitly rely on this to save their pants in some cases, like it or not.\n\nYanking it without replacement or user communication negatively impacts current users and leaves them less protected versus today.\n\nTo proceed, something like an optional PGP-based alert network should be in place, with an initial member",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6260#issuecomment-110588037,110588037,
petertodd,2015-06-10T05:31:49Z,"@jgarzik I suggested awhile back that we use transactions themselves as the broadcast medium for alerts; authenticate via scriptPubKey and put the message in an OP_RETURN. If miners are censoring the txs, not a big deal, if they aren't you have strong guarantees that you haven't missed any. Finally, spam is handled by fees, so you don't need need whitelists of who's allowed to make an alert.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6260#issuecomment-110594606,110594606,
laanwj,2015-06-10T07:42:08Z,"@jgarzik An alternative notification system would be useful; as you say, it could just be a mailing list people can subscribe to. The transaction-based system could be useful too, although it would need to be external to the core client. No hardcoded whitelist anymore.\n\nThere is a pressing reasons why this centralized broadcast system should be removed from the core network and core client, thou",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6260#issuecomment-110638235,110638235,

petertodd,2015-06-10T22:55:04Z,"The problem isn't having _a_ alert system; the problem is we don't have a good way of having more than one alert system. n-of-m multisig helps this, but it's not a huge improvement.\n\nAnyway, I don't see any technical downsides to using valid transactions as alerts; I'd be happy to code this up.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6260#issuecomment-110940724,110940724,

petertodd,2015-06-10T23:19:29Z,"@wtogami Yes exactly. Basically that provides a flood-fill mechanism with anti-spam protections, removing the need to have a whitelist of allowed alert signers. You'd just specify a P2SH address allowed to send alerts and put the alert itself in an 80-byte OP_RETURN.\n\nActually authenticating the alerts is easy for full nodes. For P2SH nodes, a neat trick is to take advantage of the fact that the",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6260#issuecomment-110944629,110944629,

It's a point of centralization we don't need, and don't benefit from-- one which creates other confusion and discord.

theymos,2015-06-11T03:33:12Z,"IMO alerts should still exist in some form for serious software bugs. For example, it seemed possible that heartbleed could have been used to steal bitcoins from users of Bitcoin-Qt in some cases (though apparently this was later learned to be unlikely).
