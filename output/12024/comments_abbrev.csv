BashCo,2017-12-26T19:40:45Z,"`fix-timesmart` appears to fix the issue I experienced with incorrect transaction timestamps when importing watch-only addresses. After compiling, I used `-rescan` as well as `-zapwallettxes`, neither of which resolved the issue (on my end). After making a new wallet and reimporting with `importmulti`, the timestamps are correct.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12024#issuecomment-354005468,354005468,

But looks like src/wallet/test/wallet_tests.cpp needs updating too. \n\nNote I don't think GitHub doesn't understand ""Fixes X and Y"" when it does it's auto-close, you probably have to write Fixes X, fixes Y.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12024#issuecomment-354018549,354018549,

luke-jr,2018-02-26T17:20:43Z,The idea IIRC was simply to ensure timestamps move forward at least in ordinary circumstances.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12024#issuecomment-368578554,368578554,
