Xekyo,2017-04-25T13:04:55Z,"If you want to minimize the number of inputs, you could just use Largest First selection as many have discovered before you. However, you will then create a large number of UTXOs that you'll need to spend in the future (when fees perhaps are even higher). In my simulations FIFO and random selection performed reasonably well among naive approaches.\n\nOne of the coin selection strategies that I'v",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10100#issuecomment-297023294,297023294,
RHavar,2017-04-25T13:19:06Z,"@Xekyo  Keep in mind this isn't purely a ""optimize for amount of inputs"", as it only changes `ApproximateBestSubset` which is a fallback after the other stuff fails (which already heavily tries to consolidate utxo's). \n\nAlso one assumption you make, which doesn't necessarily hold up for ""power users"" is that sending transactions is the only way to consolidate the utxo set.

Xekyo,2017-05-02T13:35:35Z,"@RHavar: Sorry for the late reply, I was moving to another country in the past days. At least when I analyzed Bitcoin Core's selection last year, approximate subset was used almost every run: it's only not used if you have a single UTXO that matches the target or when all UTXOs smaller than the target as a sum match the target. These two cases only occurred in less than 1.5% of the transactions in",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10100#issuecomment-298637273,298637273,
RHavar,2017-05-03T16:05:25Z,"> These two cases only occurred in less than 1.5% of the transactions in my simulation.\n\nI'm not sure this is as meaningful as it first seems. It gets hit very infrequently  _directly because_ of the behavior of `ApproximateBestSubset`. If ApproximateBestSubset was changed to something to minimize (short term) fees, then it'll get hit more often. \n\n\n> I'm hoping to be doing some more res",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10100#issuecomment-298957318,298957318,
