mikehearn,2013-01-14T18:13:01Z,"I'm not sure I see the issue. Yes you can make a node do lots of disk IO, but downloading the block chain does that too. It'd be nice to fix, but it's not a new attack vector.\n\nApps that need indexes like that will end up just using blockchain.info or various random other sites/protocols to get what they want.

sipa,2013-01-14T19:56:41Z,"The only thing keeping history is necessary for, is bootstrapping fully validating nodes. However, that doesn't require an index (or even a Bitcoin node at all - it could be provided by an HTTP-based file service or other protocols - something that web has plenty of). I'm sure that making a feature available on the P2P will result in infrastructure depending on it, something that would burden the ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2168#issuecomment-12236562,12236562,
