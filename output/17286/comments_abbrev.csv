ariard,2019-10-30 16:45:34,"@laanwj yes I was a bit dubious at first because as you they can fall out of sync easily but then I noticed than some of them were already commented like `DEFAULT_MIN_RELAY_TX_FEE` and `DEFAULT_ANCESTOR_LIMIT`. Was willingly to be consistent there, and that's still less code to grep when you're trying to understand what these values are doing.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17286#issuecomment-548002236,548002236,
