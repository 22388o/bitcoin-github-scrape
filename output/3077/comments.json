It has no concept of \"best\".\n\nOne particular (and for now, only) instance of CChain, chainBlocks, represents the currently active (=synchronized) block chain, which indeed follows the notion of best chain (but during a reorganization for example, it's not \"best\" either).\n\nMore generically, the word \"best\" is just ambiguous. In headers-first mode, another CChain instance is added (the headers chain), and it also follows its own notion of best.

    "body": "That is completely outside of the scope of this (or any single) pull request, and requires pretty much a full redesign of how Bitcoin's consensus mechanism works.\n\nIf you don't want to download or process the whole blockchain, run an SPV client (multibit, bitcoin wallet for android, ...). There are proposals that would enable non-full nodes to contribute back to the network, but they are far more invasive than what you make it seem (conflicts between chains is a detail you seem to consider trivial here, but it is ultimately the only reason why we need a chain in the first place: to reconsile conflicts). In any case, this is a discussion for the mailing list and not this refactoring-only pull request in a single client.\n",
