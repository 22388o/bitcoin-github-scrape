jonasschnelli,2013-05-20T07:07:06Z,ACK\n@Diapolo looks good on mac. Started Bitcoin-Qt with -testnet. TN-Icon showed up simultaneous with the splashscreen.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2672#issuecomment-18134764,18134764,
laanwj,2013-05-20T10:22:40Z,"Works for me. ACK for after 0.8.2 release\n\nSidenote: This is all great and al, but can we start focusing on normal users again. Only a very small percentage of users will ever even see the testnet.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2672#issuecomment-18140793,18140793,

laanwj,2013-05-30T16:30:52Z,I don't like this direct call to a core function (GetBoolArg) in GUI code. Can you pass this as a parameter to the constructor?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2672#discussion_r4461007,4461007,src/qt/bitcoingui.cpp
Diapolo,2013-06-01T11:15:20Z,"Yes, I'll change that.\nEdit: Can you take another look?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2672#discussion_r4489026,4489026,src/qt/bitcoingui.cpp
Diapolo,2013-06-01T11:26:16Z,"Perhaps a dumb question, but do we need QWidget here? Our main window has no parent AFAIK, or is this Qt standard and we have to keep parent in here? I'm asking because it's always 0.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2672#discussion_r4489032,4489032,src/qt/bitcoingui.cpp
laanwj,2013-06-01T17:09:02Z,"The Qt convention is to put the QWidget *parent last after the other arguments, and have it default to 0. But do keep it, just for consistency.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2672#discussion_r4489635,4489635,src/qt/bitcoingui.cpp
