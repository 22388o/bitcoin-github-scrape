emilengler,2019-08-10 18:12:46,Concept NACK because I think that the current icon does this job. Also we are using icons from [here](https://www.s-ings.com/typicons/) and I think its better to keep using these icons,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16583#issuecomment-520169206,520169206,
jonasschnelli,2019-08-10 19:36:58,"Looks not to bad. Either we use an icon from https://www.s-ings.com/typicons/ or you would need to put an entry into `doc/assets-attribution.md` (creator, license, etc.).\n\nHowever, I think your new icon would require padding to not appear overly large.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16583#issuecomment-520174357,520174357,
GChuf,2019-08-11 12:46:03,"I have padded the icon, and updated the copyright file. I've also noticed some mistakes in the copyright file (It's Stephen, not Stephan).\nCurrent licence file is under /contrib/debian/copyright and I'm not sure why - surely it would be better for it to stay in doc/assets-attribution.md?\n\np.s. Updated copyright 2 times because I accidentally removed ""< >"" symbols",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16583#issuecomment-520225712,520225712,
