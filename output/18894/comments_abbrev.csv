promag,2020-05-06 01:05:05,"> Not sure if this means coin control settings are reset between payments.\n\nYes, and new change shows if coin control dialog is opened again.\n\n> It would be good to note in the PR description or release notes if single wallet behavior is affected\n\nYes, at least that's what I expect - I'll note it.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18894#issuecomment-624391353,624391353,

hebasto,2020-05-06 02:49:45,Why `updateLabels()` remains `static`?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18894#discussion_r420518187,420518187,src/qt/coincontroldialog.h
promag,2020-05-06 22:48:03,That's unrelated to the fix. I do plan to pick the refactor done in #17457.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18894#discussion_r421136202,421136202,src/qt/coincontroldialog.h
Sjors,2020-05-08 13:04:09,This needs an assert that `_model` isn't `nullptr`.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18894#discussion_r422130553,422130553,src/qt/coincontroldialog.cpp
Sjors,2020-05-08 13:12:28,Good to know you plan to get rid of this static method in another PR.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18894#discussion_r422134453,422134453,src/qt/coincontroldialog.h
promag,2020-05-08 13:24:15,This will crash anyway.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18894#discussion_r422140319,422140319,src/qt/coincontroldialog.cpp
Sjors,2020-05-08 13:43:58,assert crashes are marginally easier to debug afaik,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18894#discussion_r422150694,422150694,src/qt/coincontroldialog.cpp
promag,2020-05-08 13:51:48,"Yes. But note that the model is received in the constructor and this dialog is instanced in `SendCoinsDialog` which already has the model set.\n\nI'll add the assertion if I had to push again for some reason or if others think the same.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18894#discussion_r422154935,422154935,src/qt/coincontroldialog.cpp
laanwj,2020-05-13 17:50:40,Thanks for getting rid of this.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18894#discussion_r424622653,424622653,src/qt/coincontroldialog.cpp
