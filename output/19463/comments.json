    "body": ">Allowing users to temporarily disable block indexes and filters, without pruning cutting them off from catching up later.\r\n\r\nHonestly I don't get what's the point of this - to save a little more disk space under extreme conditions, like almostly exhausted disk space, so that the node could then keep running for a littel more time?\r\n\r\n>External block indexes/filters, etc.\r\n\r\nThis seems to justify the above point, however I think one of the most-wanted features is \"external (and pluggable) block storage\", rather than \"external indices/filters etc\", although the later also seems to be nice (despite both would complicate the things further).\r\n\r\n>Avoiding pruning out from under external wallets (Armory, EPS, etc) that might need block data.\r\n\r\n>Ensuring any known Core wallet won't become unable to sync due to pruning when it is unloaded. (Included in this PR)\r\n\r\nThen, (without some filter/matching mechanism) it will in fact disable (pause) pruning until the wallet reloads, won't it? Because the node won't know whether a newly received block is unrelated (prunable), therefore the only choice is to stop pruning.\r\n\r\nIt has been a significant usability problem since quite a long time ago, that the user cannot load/import wallets/keys/addrs freely - nobody likes triggering the troubles of blockchain rescanning.\r\n\r\nI think #15946 (together with something like #15845) should be able to fix such usability problem in a simpler,better way, that:\r\n\r\nWith local blockfilterindex, the blocks could be simply discarded (pruned). Then, the once pruned blocks could be redownloaded according to local blockfilterindex while reloading wallet/importing keys/addrs - no need to worry about whether a block could be needed in the future anymore.\r\n\r\nHowever I still agree that a button allowing the user to simply \"pause/resume\" pruning would be nice, too - I hope that this could be displayed on some dashboard.",
