laanwj,2016-09-22T03:38:40Z,"My sarcasm meter isn't functioning this early in the morning, but at least since 2014: f9de17ec2f3e22fe9d96557e328af836a3590660 . Probably even earlier, should be possible to find more discussion on github.

gmaxwell,2016-09-22T18:52:32Z,Should we leave in some tests of getinfo in parallel as long as it still exists? We wouldn't want it to stop working by mistake.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8780#issuecomment-248994590,248994590,
laanwj,2016-09-25T11:07:07Z,"Agree with @gmaxwell - keeping at least one test that exercises getinfo makes sense. I don't think it's necessary to repeat all tests with getinfo and with the new call, though.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8780#issuecomment-249415636,249415636,

MarcoFalke,2016-09-25T13:04:17Z,I wonder if anyone types in `help getinfo`. (Otherwise no one will see the DEPRECATED warning anyway)\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8780#discussion_r80381630,80381630,src/rpc/misc.cpp
laanwj,2016-09-25T13:31:13Z,"Well, people use the help system. It's the only up-to-date RPC documentation that there is, and errors are usually found quickly.\n\nBut maybe not for old calls. Of course it may make sense to mention it in the release notes as well. I don't think we ever did, but even if so a reminder probably can't hurt.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8780#discussion_r80382126,80382126,src/rpc/misc.cpp
