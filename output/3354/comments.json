Adds much more user and merchant protection for reasonable zero-confirmation transactions (which I seem to get much grief about when explaining the protocol). \n\nSince double spends should(hopefully) be very few, perhaps there should be two RPC calls. One to check the double spend status of a single tx, and another to detect the double spend status off all current zero-confirmation transactions. \n\nIs there perhaps a way to trigger an external event instead of the merchants POS system constantly querying RPC for double spends?\n",

And I really don't think we want every PoS vendor in the world trying to connect to thousands of nodes...\n\nOf course the customer could Finney attack the store, but if we're talking about a low-value purchases then that is almost certainly a risk the store can profitably take.\n",

    "body": "@sipa Not likely to do any good, as malicious double-spends will just spend a single input. Of course, that leads to the next step of \"why don't we just provide the signature and prove two signatures were signed for the same scriptPubKey\" which then makes address re-use of any kind ever rather problematic, to say the least. Conveniently SHA256 midstates are no use here either, as the important bits - the COutPoints - are at the very start of a transaction.\n\nSpeaking of, if you're ever in a situation where transactions have to be re-issued false positives are a problem, e.g. bumping fees because your transaction won't mine and expired out of the mempool. Or for that matter if you ever participate in a ANYONECANPAY crowd-fund thing that fails. And then of course there's CoinJoin...\n\n@gmaxwell Another good one is how do you handle floating fees? Do you relay the double-spend even though you wouldn't relay the transaction? Because if you don't, then it acts like a IsStandard() rule split and you can do things like relay a particularly low-fee tx first, let it propagate so some of the network, then relay the high-fee version and let it propagate to your target. Of course, then there's the issue that every time we change IsStandard() the double-spend relay stops working reliably. (to the extent it ever worked at all) It interacts badly with out-of-band miner payments too: suppose I have a zero-fee tx and get some miner OOB to mine it. The rest of the network won't see my tx, which lets me broadcast the fee-paying version. Meanwhile even if the miner is \"honest\" the best they can do is tell their peers about the double-spend, and those peers will just ignore it because it has no fee attached and they wouldn't accept it to their mempool.\n",
