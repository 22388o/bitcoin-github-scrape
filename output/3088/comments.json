I've done some basic testing\u2014 instrumenting announcement and seeing that it worked like expected, but before I put a lot more time into testing it (setting up a simulated network and such) I wanted to get some feedback on the general approach of giving the peer back the address it told us.\n\n(also, this patch was bluntly forward ported from the older version that I tested\u2014 I've not run this particular version, though it does build)\n\nThere is a bunch of code motion I've included here for some of the heuristics in deciding to use the our current estimate vs the peers report. I'm not married to it, and perhaps it would be better removed and a more simpler behavior adopted.\n",

    "body": "@laanwj One example is for anti-sybil protection by associating an identity with p2pool proofs-of-work, or by simply purchasing a fidelity bond. Once you make the identity expensive to obtain, you can then use fraud proofs - for instance rather than having an expensive UTXO commitment system and associated soft-fork you can just as easily ask nodes to make signed statements as to what transactions match a given filter, and if a different peer gives a different answer, construct a compact proof that one of them was lying and thus destroy that identity. This will work particularly well in conjunction with micropayment systems for SPV node services.\n",
