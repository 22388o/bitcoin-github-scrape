Empact,2018-03-27T01:57:00Z,"Re #8856, seems the file has gone the other direction since then - maybe due to the introduction of ArgsManager.\n\nCurrently the following other util methods use GetArg:\n* GetDataDir\n* GetPidFile\n* GetDebugLogPath\n\nIn this case seems the change is required if we want to retain the state.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12765#issuecomment-376370091,376370091,

ajtowns,2018-04-11T14:16:47Z,"Two thoughts:\n * rather than have GetConfigFile use gArgs, probably better to make GetConfigFile a member of ArgsManager?\n * might make sense to use to split between config args and command line args in #11862 and have GetConfigFile/ReadConfigFile only lookup command line args for the value for ""-conf"", rather than saving it separately?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12765#issuecomment-380468162,380468162,
