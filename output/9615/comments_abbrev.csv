ryanofsky,2017-01-23T22:19:55Z,"Maybe s/should have its own minimum incremental fee/uses a conservative WALLET_INCREMENTAL_RELAY_FEE value/.

ryanofsky,2017-01-23T22:47:48Z,"Another another way to avoid the ambiguity of having different ""oldfee"" values might be to phrase error message to in terms of fee rates, rather than fees:\n\n```\nnNewFee = totalFee;\nnNewFeeRate = CFeeRate(totalFee, maxNewTxSize);\nCFeeRate minFeeRate = CFeeRate(nOldFeeRate.GetFeePerK() + ::incrementalRelayFee.GetFeePerK());\nif (nNewFeeRate < minFeeRate) {\n    CAmount recommendedTotalFe",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9615#discussion_r97435466,97435466,src/wallet/rpcwallet.cpp
morcos,2017-01-24T01:17:31Z,"hmm...  I feel like if the option is total fee (not rate) then we should give the error message in fee (not rate).   I don't feel strongly about that.., but its not really relevant to the gist of this PR anyway, so I'll leave it alone for now.     BTW, CFeeRate has a ToString().\n\nI will make the change to `Insufficient totalFee` though..\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9615#discussion_r97455866,97455866,src/wallet/rpcwallet.cpp

sdaftuar,2017-01-25T18:47:44Z,"~I think we want this logic to apply even if the user didn't specify a confirmation target -- just as long as paytxfee is 0.~ EDIT: I misread the code above, this logic does correctly do what is intended here, though I still think this is complication is unnecessary.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9615#discussion_r97849625,97849625,src/wallet/rpcwallet.cpp
sdaftuar,2017-01-25T19:39:43Z,"Actually, on further thought, we might as well have this apply even if payTxFee is set...

morcos,2017-01-26T03:45:25Z,Ok took this advice,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9615#discussion_r97927945,97927945,src/wallet/rpcwallet.cpp
TheBlueMatt,2017-01-26T16:56:25Z,I believe this is undefined behavior (though I'm no expert on tinyformat) - you're printing CAmounts with %s. I also find it super strange to print both Bitcoin and Satoshis side-by-side with no unit information.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9615#discussion_r98038862,98038862,src/wallet/rpcwallet.cpp
