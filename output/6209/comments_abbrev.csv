laanwj,2015-06-01T11:18:36Z,"I don't think it was introduced in this pull, but the `Synced Headers`, `Synched Blocks` and `Ban Score` rows blink furiously between actual values and `Fetching..` all the time.

jonasschnelli,2015-06-01T11:28:44Z,"I would prefer the checkbox – but only – if you could also set the state. Together with banning options (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6158) it would be a adequate look and feel. On the other hand, checkboxes sometimes don't really imply a change before the users presses ""save"" or something similar.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6209#issuecomment-107407100,107407100,
Diapolo,2015-06-01T11:32:17Z,@laanwj I changed to Yes/No and also we don't display `Fetching...` anymore. I also thought about making whitelisting an option but would prefer doing that via a context menu :).\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6209#issuecomment-107407811,107407811,
Diapolo,2015-06-01T11:41:02Z,@jonasschnelli If I find the time I'm going to further test your ban/unban pull and would like to add a context menu for it :).\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6209#issuecomment-107410380,107410380,

jonasschnelli,2015-06-01T11:48:53Z,@Diapolo: for banning/unbanning i think it would be more visible and more clear if the user could ban/unban over checkboxes or buttons at the peer details section (right part of the view) instead of a context menu.

laanwj,2015-06-02T06:54:15Z,"I agree that a checkbox makes sense if the user would be able to change the value. However I don't see the point to be able to change whitelisting status on a connected node. I wouldn't want to encourage people to manually whitelist peers until they disconnect/reconnect.
