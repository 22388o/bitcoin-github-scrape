laanwj,2017-12-17T11:49:25Z,"Will try to reproduce this - the last time I tried the OpenBSD build instructions they worked fine for me.\n\nThe reason we pass those options as arguments, FWIW, is that configure will remember them when the configuration needs to be regenerated. That avoids problems such as #11657.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11921#issuecomment-352250095,352250095,

canselcik,2017-12-17T21:00:34Z,"I am trying on 6.2, I haven't tried on 6.1.\n\nI am familiar with `autoconf` and aware that passing them as command-line arguments should work in theory, I was surprised when it told me ` configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables`.

fanquake,2017-12-18T07:50:44Z,I've reproduced the problem on a new 6.2 install.  The changes to the build commands do seem to fix the issue. This will also close #11868.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11921#issuecomment-352349910,352349910,

laanwj,2017-12-19T10:37:13Z,"This seems to work on OpenBSD 6.2, to build using the built-in clang 4.0 (no need to install any compiler anymore):\n```\n./configure --disable-wallet CC=cc CXX=c++ CPP=cpp\n```\nSo maybe this is only wallet related?\nThe `contrib/install_db4.sh` script, unlike configure, very likely doesn't take X=Y pairs for arguments, and the build guide mentions doing that.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11921#issuecomment-352704700,352704700,
