    "body": "Yeah, only one configurable class is necessary. Even making not signet\nregtests should be as simple as making is_signet configurable.\nWhether that class is called CSignetChainparams or CCustomChainparams\nshouldn't be very important IMO.\nAnd if it was the other way around, signet could just be adding those\nparameters to the existing class.\nI can produce 2 branches with this and signet. One with this first and the\nother with signet first.\nAlthough if I do both of them the end result will be the same in both. But\nthat may be useful to see what I have in mind. And to discuss things that\ncould be different.\nIf there's interest, I'm happy to do them.\n\n\n\n\nOn Fri, Dec 20, 2019, 19:27 Jeremy Rubin <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n\n> I'd be interested to hear @kallewoof <https://github.com/kallewoof>'s\n> thoughts on if this PR is good for signet or not -- it seems like that\n> having the signet stuff merged would make this \"nice to have\", but not\n> enabling something new (as you can use signets instead of regtests).\n>\n> \u2014\n> You are receiving this because you authored the thread.\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\n> <https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17037?email_source=notifications&email_token=AAHWGSVIANX3MEUBC2IWNTTQZUFC3A5CNFSM4I453GF2YY3PNVWWK3TUL52HS4DFVREXG43VMVBW63LNMVXHJKTDN5WW2ZLOORPWSZGOEHNYXCY#issuecomment-568036235>,\n> or unsubscribe\n> <https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AAHWGSSLVDAHLLSJXQLPG4TQZUFC3ANCNFSM4I453GFQ>\n> .\n>\n",

    "body": "I don't have strong opinions on this PR in particular, as @JeremyRubin stated, we can use multiple signets to get approximately the same effect as multiple custom-named regtests. I don't think this would be detrimental to signet, though.\r\n\r\nAs a sidenote, I would love to remove the grind genesis proof of work part from signet, but unfortunately this was discussed and people didn't like it so it was scratched (hence `-signet_genesisnonce`. I don't know if people will have a different opinion for this PR, but maybe with more feedback, we get a more complete picture on the topic.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I'm pretty much neutral.",
