jtimon,2019-12-18 23:34:58,"Sure, done.

jtimon,2019-12-20 18:01:42,"This would simplify signet.\nRight now with signet, you need to call grindblock for the genesis block.\nIt also makes the code more complicated.\nIf signet gets merged first, I can rebase this as a simplification of signet.\nIdeally both would be reviewed.\nAnother option would be to simply modify #16411 , but I don't think @kallewoof will be open to that unless he knows for sure that skippin",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17037#issuecomment-568021911,568021911,
JeremyRubin,2019-12-20 18:27:54,"I'd be interested to hear @kallewoof's thoughts on if this PR is good for signet or not -- it seems like that having the signet stuff merged would make this ""nice to have"", but not enabling something new (as you can use signets instead of regtests).",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17037#issuecomment-568036235,568036235,
jtimon,2019-12-21 22:25:39,"Yeah, only one configurable class is necessary. Even making not signet\nregtests should be as simple as making is_signet configurable.\nWhether that class is called CSignetChainparams or CCustomChainparams\nshouldn't be very important IMO.\nAnd if it was the other way around, signet could just be adding those\nparameters to the existing class.\nI can produce 2 branches with this and signet.

kallewoof,2020-01-08 06:42:47,"I don't have strong opinions on this PR in particular, as @JeremyRubin stated, we can use multiple signets to get approximately the same effect as multiple custom-named regtests. I don't think this would be detrimental to signet, though.\n\nAs a sidenote, I would love to remove the grind genesis proof of work part from signet, but unfortunately this was discussed and people didn't like it so it ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17037#issuecomment-571913364,571913364,
