laanwj,2016-06-22T06:44:23Z,Nah I think it makes sense to backport this in preparation for 0.13. Maybe mention in the release notes? Not sure how many people rely on this programmatically.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8186#issuecomment-227657410,227657410,

luke-jr,2016-07-11T11:47:45Z,"Eh, breaking API compatibility in a bugfix release? I don't see any real benefit to this. If people want the new API, they can just use 0.13.
