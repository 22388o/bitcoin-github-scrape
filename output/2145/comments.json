    "body": "@gmaxwell there is a trivial undo test possible: verify their checksums. However, how meaningful is it to check undo data without checking the coin state - there is no scenario in which you need undo data but not coin state.\n\nIn way, the system is backwards. The coin state is by far the most important thing to verify, but unfortunately it is also almost the most expensive, and it already requires consistent blocks and undo data.\n\nRegarding only checking very few with low dbcache... what would you suggest?\n\nAlso, the calculation for memory sizes based on transaction counts is only very approximately and spread over several types of caches (leveldb blktree, leveldb coindb, coins view cache). Doing the rollback pulls the transaction data in the global cache, and then changes to it in a memory-only cache on top of it, that is discarded. The transactions themself remain in the global cache though, afterwards.\n",

The next startup the database will most likely still be inconsistent, so it would be detected again (and if it isn't, maybe it was something temporary...).\n\nFor GUI users, I would like to see something like \"Your database is corrupted. Do you want to rebuild it now, or exit?\". For bitcoind I think the right approach is indeed quitting immediately with an error message instructing the user to restart with -reindex, so they can run the rebuild on their own terms (or perhaps copy a database from another instance or backup they have running).\n",

    "body": "The reason I suggested a basic check of undo data is simply because unless dbcache is very large we test far fewer blocks at level 2 and there is currently no way to do even basic checking of all the undo data. This means that if dbcache is set small, we may not discover corrupted undo data which could be trivially discovered, until a reorg.\n\nFor small dbcache values\u2014 we could give it a minimum value... or could make it always some reasonable number even if we go over our coincachesize limit?\n\nI really wish there were a way to randomly test the coins database as I expect the leveldb disk layout probably ends up with old and new data being exposed to different errors. Oh well.\n\nIn any case, tested with fuzzed undo (with and without undo checksums) and coins data. It's quite sensitive to errors.\n\nAfter running it some with a corrupted leveldb and corrupted undos, after restoring the non-corrupted files, I'm getting \n\n2013-01-04 07:09:47 ERROR: DisconnectBlock() : block and undo data inconsistent\n2013-01-04 07:09:47 ERROR: VerifyDB() : **\\* irrecoverable inconsistency in block data\n\nSo either I screwed up, or the corruption was somehow propagated to other files. I note that many of the error messages are repeated, so I can't easily tell which test failed. If giving them distinct messages is too much work, perhaps just slipping in **FILE** and **LINE** would be helpful. (though this isn't an issue in the codebase unique to the checking pull)\n",
