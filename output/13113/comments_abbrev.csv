Please either:\n- Bite the bullet and create the test\n- Create an issue to track missing tests, and mention this one\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13113#issuecomment-385323100,385323100,
MarcoFalke,2018-04-29T12:57:53Z,I think it would be easier if you just added that test. Would be trivial to send a getdata or inv with that many entries and assert that we don't hear back from them.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13113#discussion_r184882288,184882288,test/functional/test_framework/messages.py
