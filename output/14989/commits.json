This can be changed with the `-server`\n-option. In the GUI it is possible to execute RPC methods in the Debug Console\n-Dialog.\n-\n-## RPC consistency guarantees\n-\n-State that can be queried via RPCs is guaranteed to be at least up-to-date with\n-the chain state immediately prior to the call's execution. However, the state\n-returned by RPCs that reflect the mempool may not be up-to-date with the\n-current mempool state.\n-\n-### Transaction Pool\n-\n-The mempool state returned via an RPC is consistent with itself and with the\n-chain state at the time of the call. Thus, the mempool state only encompasses\n-transactions that are considered mine-able by the node at the time of the RPC.\n-\n-The mempool state returned via an RPC reflects all effects of mempool and chain\n-state related RPCs that returned prior to this call.\n-\n-### Wallet\n-\n-The wallet state returned via an RPC is consistent with itself and with the\n-chain state at the time of the call.\n-\n-Wallet RPCs will return the latest chain state consistent with prior non-wallet\n-RPCs. The effects of all blocks (and transactions in blocks) at the time of the\n-call is reflected in the state of all wallet transactions. For example, if a\n-block contains transactions that conflicted with mempool transactions, the\n-wallet would reflect the removal of these mempool transactions in the state.\n-\n-However, the wallet may not be up-to-date with the current state of the mempool\n-or the state of the mempool by an RPC that returned before this RPC. For\n-example, a wallet transaction that was BIP-125-replaced in the mempool prior to\n-this RPC may not yet be reflected as such in this RPC response."
