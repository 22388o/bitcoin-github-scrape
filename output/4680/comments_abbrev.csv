jgarzik,2014-08-11T19:34:53Z,"~~This is incorrect. script.h is very clearly used.  Do not assume based on a buggy comment...  You _must_ review the header for structures and defines found in script.h before proposing removal.~~\n\nNAK that bit.\n\nThe typedef is a duplicate, correct.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4680#issuecomment-51829135,51829135,

jgarzik,2014-08-11T20:15:52Z,"hmmm.  As I understood it, you want to include the header for references...  but looking more closely, I see all references are either typedef or virtual.  There is never a need for the compiler to explore or size the structure.  Apologies.\n\nut ACK\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4680#issuecomment-51834285,51834285,

jgarzik,2014-08-11T21:27:17Z,"@jtimon script.h inclusion is only correct if the symbols are defined _somewhere_.  The keystore.h update was correct because it included ""class CScript;""\n\nThe base58.h update is incorrect, as something is required to define CScriptID and CTxDestination.  This gets back to direct/indirect issue that @sipa referenced in #4674.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4680#issuecomment-51843365,51843365,
jtimon,2014-08-11T23:43:24Z,"I understood the criterion in 4674, but in this case I really thought that base58.h was script.h-independent: CScriptID is declared in key.h and I missed CTxDestination. But in fact it could be easily moved with CNoDestination from script.h to key.h, since they only depends on CKeyID and CScriptID (defined in key.h).\nAnyway, I'll leave the old version without touching base58 and think better how ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4680#issuecomment-51855916,51855916,
