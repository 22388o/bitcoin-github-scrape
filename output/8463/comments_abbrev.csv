I meant that ""priority"" as a property of the bitcoin network becomes more and more a relict, something no longer has a significant value or use.\n\nI agree, we should remove it or at least reduce its significant (red label, etc.).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8463#issuecomment-238179767,238179767,
