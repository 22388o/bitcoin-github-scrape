Sjors,2018-03-14T15:31:21Z,Isn't this merge premature given that 1.0.4. isn't [released](https://github.com/jgarzik/univalue/releases) yet? Or should there be a ticket in the 0.17 milestone to make sure 1.0.4 is released and compatible?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12666#issuecomment-373063929,373063929,
