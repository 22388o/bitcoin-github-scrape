The major contributing factor for my advocating going this route is  Google deprecating both 32-bit apps and GCC in favour of Clang as mentioned here :- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16110#discussion_r287915792 \n\nSome patches have already been pr",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16413#issuecomment-520231631,520231631,
