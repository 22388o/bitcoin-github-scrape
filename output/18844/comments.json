    "body": "My recollection is that the log files have _no_ compatibility guarantees, not even backward compatibility for minor versions (i.e. you can't use a database+log from 4.7 in 4.8) - which is why we flush logs on exit. The database itself is backward compatible, but not forward compatible (you can use db files from 4.7 in 4.8 but not the other way around).\r\n\r\nI'm unsure about the goal here. There used to be frequent issues with wallets being unable to be opened, and we ended up making several frequent changes to the BDB settings we open envs/databases with. At some point those issues stopped, so I suspect we found a fairly stable configuration. I wouldn't touch these things without going back through history to see what has been tried before.",

    "body": "I've gone through their older versions to check compatibility. The only changes that were made were the depends package for BDB and `configure.ac` to allow other versions. The following versions could be compiled and `feature_backwards_compatibility.py` passes with a minor change to unload the `w3` wallets before the files are copied. `feature_backwards_compatibility.py` opens new wallets from the branch in 0.19, 0.18, and 0.17 and the reverse. So this tests the compatibility of the wallet.dat file.\r\n\r\n* 4.7.25\r\n* 4.8.30\r\n* 5.0.32\r\n* 5.1.29\r\n* 5.2.42\r\n* 5.3.29\r\n\r\nVersions 6.0 introduces a new database file version which is not backwards compatible. But it is possible to take an existing wallet.dat, use it with 6.0+, and then go back to the older BDB versions. BDB won't change a database's format without an explicit upgrade.\r\n\r\nVersions 4.6 and lower have API differences. 4.6.21 had a minimal change and after applying it, the wallet.dat file still worked. 4.5.20 and lower have further API differences that I didn't feel like going through to check the database file compatibility.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nGiven this information, I think that something reasonable to do is to remove `--with-incompatible-db` and the messaging about the wallet.dat file not being portable. As these tests show, the wallet.dat file is portable across many versions. **Only the log files are not portable and those are removed upon clean shutdown**. Thus I think we should let people use system BDB instead of recommending 4.8. We can still ship 4.8 in release builds.",

However, the particular thing it is failing on is the log files as the `w3*` wallets as those wallets are not being unloaded before they are copied.
