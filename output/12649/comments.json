If someone is into flames, they can generate the svg themselfes.\r\n* My preference would be to move the patch file into the `devtools` subfolder, since it seems this is only useful for devs.\r\n* Unrelated: You could add an `:(exclude)` for `.patch` files in line 19 of `./contrib/devtools/lint-whitespace.sh` if you feel like it.",

I feel kind of weird about this but it's the only way I could figure out for hosting the example file in a way where people can click it and actually zoom, use mouseover events, etc. I feel like that's a really compelling part of the flamegraph tool, and is important to demonstrate why it's so much cooler than other profiling tools. If someone who has access to `bitcoincore.org` or another more official resource (maybe the wiki?) could host the file there (it's a small static cacheable file) I'd be happy to change the link.",
