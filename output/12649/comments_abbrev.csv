MarcoFalke,2018-03-08T19:48:31Z,"Concept ACK ðŸ”¥, just some notes:\n\n* I'd prefer if we didn't check in the svg file (less files, less to maintain). If someone is into flames, they can generate the svg themselfes.\n* My preference would be to move the patch file into the `devtools` subfolder, since it seems this is only useful for devs.\n* Unrelated: You could add an `:(exclude)` for `.patch` files in line 19 of `./contrib/dev",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12649#issuecomment-371602680,371602680,
