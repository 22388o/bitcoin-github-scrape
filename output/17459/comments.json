    "body": "@practicalswift: Thanks for clarifying!\r\nMy strong assumption was that in _any_ possible build, one of the dozens `.cpp` files which currently include the `compat/assumptions.h` header (which after all says \"compile-time verification\", implying more than merely documentation) would also do so in the future, triggering the error in case `NDEBUG` is set.\r\nAlso it seemed quite fishy to me that the check was even present in two `.cpp` files, not just one. Looking deeper into it, that seems to have historic reasons: introduced originally by gmaxwell with commit 9b59e3bda8c137bff885db5b1f9150346e36e076, the `NDEBUG` check was only present in `main.cpp`. Then later when `main.cpp` was split up into `validation.cpp` and `net_processing.cpp` it got copied over into both files (commits e736772c56a883e2649cc8534dd7857a0718ec56, 76faa3cdfedbd3fc91be4ecfff77fc6dc18134fb by TheBlueMatt; part of PR #9260 with a very entertaining title/description :laughing: ).\r\n\r\nStill feels odd to have the exact same preprocessor construct and error string scattered aorund in three places in the same project, but I get your point.",
