ryanofsky,2019-07-30 18:41:20,"I'd NACK this PR in it's current form, but I think it could be fixed up without too much effort. Currently, commit ""Use ArgsManager::ALLOW_STRING flag explicitly"" (181f462dd983c0218618c1f64b65eefecb32ca4e) is changing too much behavior at the same time, and the current PR description doesn't begin to describe all the changes, and there are no release notes.

hebasto,2019-07-31 20:29:17,"@ryanofsky \n> I think some parts of it could be rolled back to limit scope of this PR and preserve more current behavior, while allowing more targeted improvements to be done in the future.\n\nDone. Only simple cases are in this PR. Other parts have been rolled back.\n\n>  I would just like to see it split up into smaller commits...\n\nDone. A big commit has been split in two smaller ones.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16476#issuecomment-517008431,517008431,
