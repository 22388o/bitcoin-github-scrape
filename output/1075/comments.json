    "body": "Pretty awesome.     Should this go under a tools menu or should it really be burried under help->debug window->console tab?\n\nDoes everyone else really like the nested scrollbars you get?  (type help a couple times)  I'm concerned that this might confuse users that I'm trying to support  \"scroll down and you'll see it\" \"I'm scrolled all the way down!\". It's also a bit annoying if you're running a command over and over again to see if something changes to have to scroll internally to the entry to see it.  (e.g. run getinfo over and over looking for connections changing)\n\nAlso, the fact that you can't copy large chunks of commands is bad from a support perspective.  Its helpful if people can say \"I ran all these commands and got all these results\".\n\nSending the stop RPC makes the UI lockup for a long time (30 seconds?) before eventually shutting down.\n\nWhen I first bring up the console focus doesn't move to the text entry box. I have to click it. But it has a blinking cursor even before I do, I think the focus is on the output box.. so it doesn't seem responsive. This only happens the first time after startup. After that it seems to remember.\n\nThe green and grey boxes don't seem all that intuitive to me. I'd personally just put [request] [reply]. But I admit this this is mostly taste and you should probably ignore me.\n\nCopy works differently in single element responses vs multi-element responses.  E.g.  type \"getblockhash 5\" copy the hash,  then \"getblock [paste]\"  and copy the first txn hash.    If you do something that has the second behavior first you may believe that it's not possible to copy in the first case, because you don't get any incremental selection. I think ideally incremental selection should always work.\n",

    "body": "- Eventually it makes sense to add a tools menu where Sign message and verify message should also go. However, it's hidden in the second tab for a good reason. Users should not stumble too easy on it so it's now a second tab of a dangerous-looking window.\n- I don't like the nested scrollbars either. However, the Qt QTableWidget doesn't like rows that are too tall (they break scrolling, as the y offset can only start at a whole cell). That's why tall cells get them. \n- Selecting and copying multiple cells could be added.\n- Yes it should probably focus the input box when the tab is selected.\n- ~~Typing the \"stop\" RPC command hangs the UI for as long as it takes to shutdown: seems that the UI is not hidden in this case when it leaves the main loop (could be easily fixed, this problem is not related to the console but happens also when you shut down some other way).~~ (fixed by #1209)\n- The green and grey boxes are categories, they should go together with filtering. I intend to add buttons at the top with the same boxes to hide/show them (I also want to add normal debug/error messages). I'm open to suggestions as to the colors, or even icons (boxes _are_ placeholders), but I don't want to much discussion about this.\n\nIMO given that there are no critical issues we should merge this as soon as possible. It's better to have something, and it is functionality only a very small part of people will use, so perfecting it is not the foremost priority.\n",
