    "body": "> What about scripts, can't they be critical as well to spend utxos?\r\n\r\nThere are basically two types of scripts that we store: 1) watchonly imports, and 2) the segwit scripts for our keys. For watchonly imports, I don't really think that these are necessary to keep as presumably there is some place else that has those scripts. For segwit scripts for our keys, those are automatically added to the wallet's in-memory `mapScripts` on loading so we don't need to keep them. IIRC the only reason those scripts were written to disk after keys were removed from the keypool was to allow for downgrading to a non-segwit version.",
