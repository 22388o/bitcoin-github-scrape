Furthermore I don't think we should collect and add documents to our git tree that describe common sense. To the best of my knowledge, none of the inappropriate behavior mentioned in the document ever happened within the Bitcoin Core GitHub project. Feel free to prove me wrong, but I propose to close this.",
