    "body": "Reading the comments about increasing `OUTPUT_GROUP_MAX_ENTRIES` from 10 to 100: https://bitcoincore.reviews/17824.html\r\n\r\nnit: I think it will be better if we have MIN, MAX and DEFAULT in such cases and allow user to set anything between MIN and MAX. For `OUTPUT_GROUP_MAX_ENTRIES`:\r\n\r\n`OUTPUT_GROUP_DEFAULT_ENTRIES`:10\r\n`OUTPUT_GROUP_MIN_ENTRIES`: 10\r\n`OUTPUT_GROUP_MAX_ENTRIES`: 100\r\n\r\nMentioned it as 'nit' because use of constants in Bitcoin Core is already discussed in few PRs: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21815#issuecomment-830508296 (4)\r\n\r\nIncreasing it from 10 to 100 is not an issue, real issues are with coin selection however that is out of scope for this PR. Had one related question which was answered by Andrew Chow: https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/q/106418/ \r\n\r\nOther issue:\r\n\r\nTx: [`aa6986b774b1a7bdf45c2d4df43161996fa4caf00725889fb91ca79a3bd8fd9c`](https://tbtc.bitaps.com/aa6986b774b1a7bdf45c2d4df43161996fa4caf00725889fb91ca79a3bd8fd9c) has 14 inputs out of which 9 are associated with one address: `tb1qyqd9p9d2rc5a9v6cphucn999ljfcvdhymthypy`\r\n\r\n`avoidpartialspends=1` in bitcoin.conf and tried sending 0.051 BTC\r\n\r\nI am not sure why other inputs were used because sum of inputs associated with `tb1qyqd9p9d2rc5a9v6cphucn999ljfcvdhymthypy` = 0.004 + 0.0076 + 0.01 + 0.009 + 0.007 + 0.0045 + 0.0066 + 0.0055 + 0.005 = 0.0592 (Assume these are 90 instead of 9)\r\n\r\nMaybe because it will create a small change? But `avoidpartialspends=1` is mentioned as an option that improves privacy. In this case user is associating himself with extra 5 addresses which could have been avoided in this transaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "> OUTPUT_GROUP_MAX_ENTRIES is only relevant when users are privacy conscious enough to enable avoid partial spend, but then on the other hand also heavily reuse addresses. It seems unlikely that this constellation occurs so frequently\r\n\r\nI was thinking about possible examples in which a user has saved `avoidpartialspends=1` in bitcoin.conf but still reusing addresses. Two examples that I could think of:\r\n\r\n1. User read about `avoidpartialspends` being good for privacy, saves it in `bitcoin.conf` assuming it will manage everything for the user, forgets about reuse after sometime being careless or receives donation to one of his address regularly or whitelisted one address on an exchange and use it regularly for withdrawals or one bitcoin address used for payouts in some website/app or some other mistake.\r\n2. Forced address reuse attack: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Privacy#Forced_address_reuse\r\n\r\nIn both cases its difficult to know if 100 will be good enough for all the users. Maybe it works for most of them.\r\n\r\n> Perhaps it could be useful to let the user pick a maximum size if they want to limit how much they\u2019re paying for the consolidation, but I think setting a maximum fee using -maxtxfee would capture their intent better.\r\n\r\nAgree. It will be useful if users could decide this and save in `bitcoin.conf`. Using `maxtxfee` is just a workaround which I had also suggested to one user who had issues with more inputs being selected by coin selection algorithm: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/20598#issuecomment-741567676 which will abort the transaction.\r\n\r\nSince we had discussed about other wallets in [PR review club meeting](https://bitcoincore.reviews/18418#l-247), I was curious if they use any such max limit:\r\n\r\n[Electrum](https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/blob/cad4e77853b1d3ae5fdaaa868c2fce67780a8870/electrum/coinchooser.py#L441): if any coin is spent from a user address, all coins are.\r\n\r\n[Wasabi](https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi/pull/2338): Treat same-scriptpubkey coins as one big coin. _If group has an **unconfirmed**, then the whole group is unconfirmed._\r\n\r\n[Joinmarket](https://github.com/JoinMarket-Org/joinmarket-clientserver/blob/master/docs/release-notes/release-notes-0.6.2.md#auto-freeze-of-deposits-to-reused-addresses) : To prevent forced address reuse attacks, (sometimes called dust attacks, but that's a poor name), any deposit to an already-used address is freezed by default.\r\n\r\n[Samourai](https://pastebin.com/zR3w97Mn): Not sure but I tested with 15 UTXOs for same address and they were all added as inputs for the transaction.

Otherwise we would make no improvements and add no features to Core that leak the Core version being used. The general advice appears to be that users should run a recent version (if not the most recent version) of Core. That doesn't leak anything regarding your transactions or your net worth.\r\n\r\n> Then we should mention the privacy issues in docs, trade-offs and reasons for not improving privacy.\r\n\r\nI think everyone supports improving the docs.\r\n\r\nedit: This discussion should move to IRC and away from this PR I think.

    "body": "(typed this before github showed johns anwer so there is some duplication here I think) It's not great in theory. But I think we can expect that users know what they are getting into here. The users have reused addresses a lot (willingly or unwillingly) and realized that this is a threat to their privacy. Then they have opted in to avoid reuse which warns users that this can create higher fees via high numbers of inputs. And there isn't even much of a risk here if somebody sets this option just for the fun of it. As long as there is no address reuse in that wallet, avoid reuse also won't kick in.\r\n\r\nBecause this is a privacy feature that users have opted into it seems the better trade-off to me that someone is surprised by a higher fee rather than being surprised that they could only consolidate 10 outputs in one transaction when they had 30 outputs in that destination. And then they have to further watch out to no compromise themselves when consolidating the remaining 20 outputs. What users are getting aside from privacy protection is a consolidation transaction. While the fees might be high on this first tx it will hopefully also create a change output that is larger and will be much cheaper to spend later on.\r\n\r\n`maxapsfee` is only relevant if avoid partial spends is not activated. If avoid partial spends is not set, the wallet will still try to avoid partial spends and prefer to use those coins that avoid partial spends of those that don't if the premium is below the threshold.",
