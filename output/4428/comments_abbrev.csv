laanwj,2014-07-01T07:33:05Z,Please don't assign `__func__` to a variable here. `__func__` _is_ already a hidden variable added to every function by the compiler but just using it as-is makes it easier to pick out.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4428#discussion_r14391734,14391734,src/init.cpp
