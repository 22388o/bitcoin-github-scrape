    "body": "@maaku Ah, yeah, I'd forgotten we modify the block's nTime after creation, ugh; there's another usage of UpdateTime() in rpcmining.cpp in the getblocktemplate code that needs fixing too.\n\nAn alternative would be for UpdateTime() to simply never reduce the block nTime, which would remove the seldom tested codepath where the block template fails due to time going backwards. Basically the difference between what you've done and that option is that if GetAdjustedTime() somehow goes backwards by > 2 hours you risk creating a block that is invalid due to being too far into the future. Equally though, if GetAdjustedTime() goes backwards sufficiently far back that GetMedianTimePast() > GetAdjustedTime() + 2hrs you're also equally screwed - I have to wonder if the types of problems that would cause the latter are all that much less likely than the problems that would cause the former.\n\nIn any case, this pull-req needs more comments explaining what's going on, e.g. explain why UpdateTime() can cause the mining loop to break on line https://github.com/maaku/bitcoin/blob/blocktime-monotonic/src/miner.cpp#L539\n\nre: constraining the validity rules - of course, that needs a -dev mailing list post for the mempool change, and a full BIP if we eventually do a soft-fork.\n",
