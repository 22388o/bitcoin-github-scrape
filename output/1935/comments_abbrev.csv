luke-jr,2012-10-15T21:06:29Z,"Not all releases are signed by Gavin (notably stable/backport releases are not), and users probably shouldn't be expected to setup the key themselves anyway. There are a bunch of PGP keys in git already for verifying against - any way to use those easily?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1935#discussion_r1847335,1847335,contrib/verifysfbinaries/verify.sh
runeksvendsen,2012-10-15T22:10:28Z,"0.7.0 is signed by Gavin. Is that not a stable release?\nI considered including installation of the key in the script, but I figured it was preferable to let the users install these by themselves. But now that you point it out, I'm not sure why the script shouldn't just install if it reaches the line above.\n\nWhere are those PGP keys in git that you mention?

So you're saying the script should pull in a public key from a remote location and use that to verify? That makes sense.\nThis would create another point of attack though.
