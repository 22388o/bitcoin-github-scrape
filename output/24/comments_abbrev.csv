orweinberger,2014-01-07T11:12:04Z,"@gavinandresen @laanwj The gettransaction call does not return the 'fee' attribute for some reason.\n\nI'm using version `0.8.6-1.el6` and I'm getting the following output for a transaction that was sent with a fee:\n\n```\n{\n    ""amount"" : 0.00100000,\n    ""confirmations"" : 92,\n    ""blockhash"" : ""0000000000000000977e56d6c0997d54b1b83c4e5bde4b5fccbe2098b4db4e00"",\n    ""blockindex"" : 307,\n    ""b",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24#issuecomment-31729552,31729552,
laanwj,2014-01-07T18:01:43Z,@orweinberger it only adds a `fee` attribute if the transaction is from you (sent)\nsee https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/rpcwallet.cpp#L1471 \n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24#issuecomment-31761850,31761850,
orweinberger,2014-01-07T18:20:18Z,@laanwj Thanks for clarifying that. Is there any way for me to see if a transaction that was sent to me had a fee included in it?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24#issuecomment-31763663,31763663,
laanwj,2014-01-07T19:31:56Z,"No idea... maybe you can remove the check and it will work for received transactions too, I'm not sure.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24#issuecomment-31770596,31770596,
sipa,2014-01-07T22:17:40Z,You can only compute the fee if you know the values of all inputs. This is only the case if all inputs are from yourself.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24#issuecomment-31785936,31785936,
