practicalswift,2017-08-16T08:25:35Z,@jnewbery @laanwj Good point! The change to `src/tinyformat.h` is no longer included in this PR.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10645#issuecomment-322701544,322701544,
jnewbery,2017-08-15T21:03:14Z,"There may be an argument to not making style changes to `tinyformat.h`, which occasionally pulls in changes from upstream. Don't know what @laanwj's view is on this?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10645#discussion_r133302995,133302995,src/tinyformat.h
laanwj,2017-08-16T08:10:57Z,"Agree, we should generally minimize changes to tinyformat.h, and if it is just style it just adds burden on us with no clear gain. \n\nIf you get upstream to accept this it's okay with me. But I think they want to keep compatiblity with older C++.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10645#discussion_r133383790,133383790,src/tinyformat.h
