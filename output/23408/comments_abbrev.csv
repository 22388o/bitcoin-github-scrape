MarcoFalke,2021-11-01 11:55:10,It should be possible to test this by checking out the commit prior to d6492d4ed053e2b9088a9666dc55c7417c7d4c70 and then applying the commit of this pull request. Then a few minutes or hours of fuzzing should give an assert.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23408#issuecomment-956169925,956169925,

This is a good change; giving the fuzzer more hints about how to construct structurally-valid scripts will hopefully help explore more code-paths and, at the very least, should help save cycles.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23408#issuecomment-956278739,956278739,
