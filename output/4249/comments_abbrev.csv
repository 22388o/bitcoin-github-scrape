jrick,2014-05-29T16:54:19Z,I mentioned in #bitcoin-dev but there's another reference to bc.i in doc/bootstrap.md:\n\n```\nThis can be a process that can take multiple days as the [Bitcoin block chain](https://blockchain.info/charts/blocks-size)...\n```\n\nMay want to consider removing that as well.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4249#issuecomment-44555218,44555218,
laanwj,2014-05-29T17:23:34Z,"@jrick Too late for this pull, but feel free to change it. On the other hand, that document already depends on centralized service to get a copy of the block chain, so the reference to bc.i could hardly be worse :)\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4249#issuecomment-44558649,44558649,
sipa,2014-05-29T17:31:13Z,I disagree. You don't need to trust the provider of bootstrap.dat as it's verified on import.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4249#issuecomment-44559643,44559643,
laanwj,2014-05-29T17:37:38Z,You don't need to trust that link either. It's just a way to show people approximately at which block we're now at. No harm can come from it even if they lie about that. It's not used in the process.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4249#issuecomment-44560421,44560421,
