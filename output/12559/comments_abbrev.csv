laanwj,2018-03-05T21:40:06Z,Can you please add some rationale as to how you checked that the cs_main lock can be safely removed from these functions?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12559#issuecomment-370575814,370575814,
promag,2018-03-05T21:55:44Z,"I've manually checked what calls were made in each RPC, and checked that none uses something protected by `cs_main`. I guess this could be checked by `AssertLockIsHeld` or similar, but it's not widely adopted yet.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12559#issuecomment-370580868,370580868,
laanwj,2018-03-05T22:32:18Z,"Thanks. What I'm a little bit worried about is that some of the CWallet calls might internally lock cs_main, which will cause potential deadlocks due to lock ordering if cs_wallet is already held. Or maybe not now, but that someone will do so in the future.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12559#issuecomment-370591311,370591311,
