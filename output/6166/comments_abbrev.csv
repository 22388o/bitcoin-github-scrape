laanwj,2015-05-22T08:18:05Z,"I don't want to remove the existing strings for 0.11, people may have already translated them (a string freeze is a string freeze).

Diapolo,2015-05-24T17:22:03Z,"@laanwj Sorry, but as I use `-help-debug` all time with german translation turned on, I refuse to leave this translation string out, while ALL others are indeed translated, that makes no sense to me.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6166#issuecomment-105040870,105040870,
