sipa,2015-01-04T18:12:49Z,Added a commit to catch and shutdown gracefully in case of LevelDB errors during flush.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5597#issuecomment-68642482,68642482,
sipa,2015-01-05T23:57:03Z,"This is not sufficient (as testing by @gmaxwell shows), there are many cases where reads from the database can be triggered and aren't caught.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5597#issuecomment-68804374,68804374,
laanwj,2015-01-06T09:21:37Z,"Yes, leveldb exceptions an escape from CCoinsViewDB in many other places as just the flush, and if they happen in the network code they are caught in the top-level handler, be logged, and the process will happily continue.\n\nHowever, as this is strictly an improvement we should still merge this?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5597#issuecomment-68842872,68842872,

Diapolo,2015-01-07T14:09:06Z,@sipa Why did you choose to leave out the indentation? Our code get's pretty ugly again over time? Could we finally let the clang-format tool let do it's job and we also had a remove orphan spaces and tabs script if I remember correctly...\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5597#discussion_r22587072,22587072,src/main.cpp
