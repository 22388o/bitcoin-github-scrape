MarcoFalke,2018-01-24T20:14:35Z,Generating that block will not help to get us out of ibd any sooner. Am I mistaken?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12264#discussion_r163665254,163665254,test/functional/p2p-versionbits-warning.py

MarcoFalke,2018-01-25T00:10:52Z,"I sometimes make tests fail on purpose, so having to wait a minute (or going into the test each time and having to modify it) is somewhat inconvenient.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12264#discussion_r163717827,163717827,test/functional/p2p-versionbits-warning.py
MarcoFalke,2018-01-25T00:12:46Z,"Also, should the test fail for some reason, the earlier you know the better.
