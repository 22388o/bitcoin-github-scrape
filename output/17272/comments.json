The author of this PR doesn't think OP_RETURN outputs are spam and thus proposes to make them standard (more than 1 in a tx). This will actually save blockchain space. If a person has to or wants to use OP_RETURN and needs 5 outputs for their data they'll have to compose 5 different TXs with at least one input. Inputs take up more space than outputs so by leaving >1 OP_RETURN outputs non-standard we enforce higher blockchain usage. there is no reason why we should limit them in my opinion. Just like batch sending is possible with multiple outputs (addresses), batch data embedding should be possible too.",

Fees do not pay for outputs or transactions, they merely bribe miners (who do not carry the burden) to include them in blocks. These policy spam filters exist to help prevent spam _regardless_ of the fee included.\r\n\r\nWhat exactly do you mean by \"burden\" here? If arbitrary data is stored in the blockchain without using OP_RETURN (e.g. by just misusing the 20-byte hash in a P2PKH output, which can't even be prevented), the burden is actually much higher since it has to be kept in the UTXO set forever. Why is exactly _one_ output of OP_RETURN considered as non-spam, but more than one is?",
