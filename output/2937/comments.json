    "body": "Thanks for the feedback.  It did end up being more code than I thought it would.  Reason is, there's 3 different protocol variations to contend with (no nonce, zero nonce, matching nonce).  Also, there was no pong receiver at all, so had to add that as well.\n\nI added a good amount of debug text in \"if (fDebug) ...\" blocks, which is rather verbose.  I'm surprised there's no dprintf() or similar macro, perhaps there's something I missed.  Every debug line adds another possible code path, because of that if statement.  Probably the lowest-hanging fruit is to jettison those.\n\nI wonder how a hook system would work?  Registering a handler would seem to complicate things even more.  The ping and pong messages have to be sent/received anyway, that would just add another layer of indirection to shift the processing elsewhere, unless there's something I'm missing here.\n",

I looked through the history but could not find it.  I'm guessing it's another implementation that has this bug?\n\nI like the idea of only accepting these weird pong replies (nonce of zero) if that implementation can be detected.

I am unsure what clients are sending these.  Their version string comes across as \"0.8.99\" but I haven't found any version history that would ever send a pong (not a ping!) with a nonce of zero.\n\nWhile running it overnight, I noticed yet another bad client pong behavior.  The peer is sending me pong messages with no payload at all (zero bytes).  This causes an exception during unserialize, which is caught so nothing harmful happens, but it's unclean.\n",

Instead of previous bloat, they are all now unified into a single printf statement.\n\n2) Incoming pong message size is now checked.  Unfortunately, I did not find any more peers who were giving me those empty-payload pong messages, but if they show up again, they will be cleanly logged this time, instead of throwing the exception.  I noticed in_avail() in serialize.h returns an int.  Shouldn't it be a size_t?  There are no other users of it in bitcoind, I have noticed.\n\n3) I just now call RAND_bytes() for each peer, instead of trying to save random entropy by only calling it once per overall ping request and then just incrementing it for each peer.  Should now never be guessable, but at the cost of burning the entropy pool.  Perhaps use RAND_pseudo_bytes() instead?\n\nAlso, this pull request is getting somewhat long in the tooth.  I ran it against the latest top of tree, and it still applies cleanly and works just fine.  Should I close this pull request and make a new pull request from a branch closer to the very latest, or keep this pull request open?\n",
