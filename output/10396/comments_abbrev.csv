sipa,2017-05-14T18:27:31Z,"> Why remove bytes_serialized?\n\nIt has no real meaning. It wasn't an accurate representation of how much space on disk was used, and its definition is very hard to maintain after #10195.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10396#issuecomment-301330627,301330627,
laanwj,2017-05-15T05:11:47Z,"Nice idea to add the leveldb size estimate - I had no idea such a thing existed.\n\nI'm not that happy that `bytes_serialized` is a going away. \n\nIt provided a fairly neutral way of measuring the UTXO set size (It is not dependent on a specific database implementation and its overhead), I understand leveldb's estimate is better in estimating the actual disk usage, but `bytes_serialized` is u",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10396#issuecomment-301377770,301377770,
sipa,2017-05-15T05:41:07Z,"The problem is mostly that after #10195, we start relying heavily on LevelDB's prefix compression (whenever two subsequent keys share a prefix, that  repeated part is not encoded). This is needed because multiple outputs from the same txid otherwise will require an extra 32 bytes on disk for every output after the first.\n\nIt is possible to implement a compatibility layer, which processes the out",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10396#issuecomment-301381106,301381106,

sipa,2017-05-15T22:43:05Z,"@paveljanik Those warnings seem unrelated. #10195 adds the necessary overrides as most of the relevant function signatures and changed there anyway, but I don't think that should happen in this PR.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10396#issuecomment-301625801,301625801,
laanwj,2017-05-22T10:42:48Z,"The problem is that if you use `override` in one place in a class, the compiler (at least gcc?) wants you to use it everywhere where it's appropriate. Might be better to leave it out then add it for the whole class later.
