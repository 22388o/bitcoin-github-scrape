That's a flaw in QA infra. It should be merging to master before running tests/checks.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19391#issuecomment-875181026,875181026,

That's a flaw in QA infra.\n\nThere's a myriad of reasons to keep development branches rebased up and/or up to date.\n\nIf I'm a dev wanting to just simply checkout and test this code, i.e `git fetch origin pull/19391/head:19391 && git checkout 19391`, not only should I not have to worry about merging it into master myself, but, having a commit",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19391#issuecomment-911163608,911163608,
