pstratem,2015-11-25T03:23:24Z,@dcousens I was reviewing another PR and noticed that it (sort of) relied on this behavior.\n\nWent and looked a bit and noticed basically every caller does.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7094#issuecomment-159476528,159476528,

laanwj,2015-11-25T07:10:40Z,Anything concerning time deltas is a different issue. I certainly think a monotonic clock would be useful for some measurements (such as pings). \n\nHowever this code change would just make sure that the _absolute time_ is positive. More of a sanity check of the OS and boost (eg time() returns -1 on error).\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7094#issuecomment-159522258,159522258,

paveljanik,2015-11-28T11:22:16Z,"IIUIC, it is only for ""just to be sure"".\n\nE.g. on Linux kernel, you can't make `time` to fail, especially in the case when NULL is used as an argument. If non-NULL is passed, it can fail when kernel's `put_user` fails (and in such case, more bad things can happen ;-). The other question is boost...\n\nACK\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7094#issuecomment-160277998,160277998,
laanwj,2015-11-30T13:48:24Z,"@paveljanik I guess time() could fail if the relevant syscall is somehow blocked off, say, through seccomp_bpf. And yes boost... who knows\nAll cases in which it's better to fail fast.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7094#issuecomment-160631845,160631845,
