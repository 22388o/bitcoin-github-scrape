laanwj,2014-04-30T06:31:26Z,I really don't understand why you do get much more updates.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4105#issuecomment-41764869,41764869,
Diapolo,2014-04-30T06:35:23Z,"Me too, but as you see there WAS more... is you Tx client out of date? Well I didn't update mine for some time now, so that shouldn't be a problem. Can you try again and delete your local `locale` folder, where the client stores it's translation files.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4105#issuecomment-41765058,41765058,
laanwj,2014-04-30T06:36:02Z,"As for the en_GB translation, it doesn't seem serious. I don't see anything in there that is translated differently than en_US?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4105#issuecomment-41765093,41765093,
Diapolo,2014-04-30T06:36:49Z,"See the @BitcoinPullTester error `lrelease error: Parse error at /mnt/bitcoin/win32-build/src/qt/locale/bitcoin_ko_KR.ts:1199:22: Unexpected ''.` perhaps Windows fetches these, while the Linux Tx client rejects them? Too bad Tx allows such garbage in it's files... what can we do?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4105#issuecomment-41765131,41765131,
laanwj,2014-04-30T06:37:44Z,The parse error in ko_KR is caused by stray control characters. Last time I manually cut those out before committing.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4105#issuecomment-41765180,41765180,
Diapolo,2014-04-30T06:39:50Z,"I'm going to remove the en_GB translation, it doesn't make sense... also there is a fr_Ca one, which is at 0%, that doesn't make any sense... do you suggest removing them here or on Tx? I can't cleanup the ctrl chars, maybe you can do it?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4105#issuecomment-41765304,41765304,
laanwj,2014-04-30T06:45:05Z,"Yeah, no problem. I'm probably going to make a script that fetches ALL translations (`tx pull -f`) and postprocesses them (remove crap like control characters and line numbers).\n\nRemoving the empty translations on transifex would make sense.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4105#issuecomment-41765582,41765582,
Diapolo,2014-04-30T06:48:05Z,"Damn, I tried to remove bitcoin_fr_CA.ts and got this in git `rename src/qt/locale/{bitcoin_fr_CA.ts => bitcoin_ku_IQ.ts} (90%)`??\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4105#issuecomment-41765708,41765708,
laanwj,2014-04-30T07:59:05Z,See #4110\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4105#issuecomment-41770026,41770026,
