After all, if this really was a trivial change, I wouldn't have written a fifteen line git commit description!\n\nThat said... one good thing about merging it at the beginning of the v0.12.0 development cycle, is that it's a change that's highly unlikely to lead to actual loss of funds, so we'll give the whole ecosystem plenty of time to find and fix the off-by-one type errors that are probably still out there in various wallets. (and in that sense, yeah, from just a loss-of-funds point of view I agree it's a trivial change, but knowing that requires a surprisingly good understanding of how the whole system works!)\n",

I think it's nice to keep it that way.\nSince #5936 there is a locktime argument that can be passed manually, fully in the spirit with raw transaction creation.\n",
