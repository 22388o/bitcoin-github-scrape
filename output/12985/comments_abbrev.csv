fanquake,2018-04-18T04:56:03Z,"I've tested this using the method @ken2812221 suggested. Basically create a bitcoin.conf with\n```\nwallet=C:\Windows\xxxx\n```\n\nIf you then install ```0.16.0```, and choose to run at the end of the installation, Core will error on startup, because we can't specify a path as a wallet name.\n<img width=""514"" alt=""error"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/863730/38912299-152ba5a4",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12985#issuecomment-382261369,382261369,
laanwj,2018-04-18T06:37:46Z,@fanquake Thanks for testing. To be clear: All in all that seems a positive result? I suppose you used `C:\windows` as a path that bitcoin core is supposed to not have access to?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12985#issuecomment-382278735,382278735,
