This means that newlines, escape characters etc can be written freely.\n\nBut perhaps we trust our RPC clients to not perform such malicious actions?\n\nAlso: a test could be added checking that a RPC c",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15753#issuecomment-480258272,480258272,

kallewoof,2019-04-08T00:34:05Z,"@practicalswift Thanks for feedback. I will look into using SanitizeString.\n\n@MarcoFalke It is different in that you do not need to combine the logs. You can look at a specific node's debug.log output and see logprint's from the tests directly.\n\n@promag The output from all combined logs is rather large, so having a way to see test debug log in individual node log files was convenient.\n\",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15753#issuecomment-480647457,480647457,
MarcoFalke,2019-04-08T15:21:59Z,"Adding an RPC to bitcoind for a change that can be realized with test-only helper scripts seems overkill. What about modifying `combine_logs.py` to optionally only combine the logs for a single node, as opposed to all nodes?

kallewoof,2019-04-08T23:13:30Z,@MarcoFalke I like the idea of modifying combine_logs to only combine a single node log. I think that would solve it on my end.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15753#issuecomment-481041132,481041132,
