gmaxwell,2012-05-12T11:16:21Z,"Awesome, it looks greatâ€”  except copying is kinda broken now, you can only copy the whole row (including the timestamp).  E.g. getinfo and then copy the difficulty for me.  Other than that I think it's great.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1269#issuecomment-5667656,5667656,
laanwj,2012-05-12T11:30:17Z,"I've removed the timestamps from the copy output. Apart from that, there's little to do, Qt only supports copying entire cells at once at most (or you end up back with scrollbars in the cells, if widgets are placed in there).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1269#issuecomment-5667756,5667756,
laanwj,2012-05-12T13:19:59Z,"Ok, what about this? The output is now a rich text view instead of a tableview, should be easier for copying.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1269#issuecomment-5668416,5668416,
gmaxwell,2012-05-12T14:22:03Z,"Looks a little less clean, but its worth it for the big improvement in copy behavior. I think it should be set to a monospace font (will make the hashes and such line up).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1269#issuecomment-5668821,5668821,
laanwj,2012-05-12T16:44:35Z,"Should be better / good enough now. Explicitly scaling the icons with bilinear filtering so that they don't look ragged, and switched to a monospace font.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1269#issuecomment-5669886,5669886,
