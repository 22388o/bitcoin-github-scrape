sipa,2013-03-29T02:06:00Z,"I'm unsure about this.\n\nOn the one hand, the blocks are available, and getblock() exists- it's stupid that it cannot give you the transactions in it.\n\nOn the other hand, I really don't want to encouraging services that depend on the presense of (indexable) block chain data in the first place.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2421#issuecomment-15625637,15625637,

sipa,2013-06-15T14:59:35Z,"So, some more thoughts. The generic problem this pullreq tries to solve is very worthwhile: right now, we have the full blocks stored and indexed, but retrieving anything more than the headers and the txids in them is not possible without txindex=1. This shouldn't be necessary - just a sequential scan through the blocks is perfectly meaningful.\n\nI'm still unconvinced about the implementation tho",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2421#issuecomment-19497727,19497727,
jgarzik,2013-06-24T14:54:21Z,"Agree w/ @sipa.  This functionality is OK to have, but in a different form.\n\nThe first suggestion is the most powerful, and would seem to solve many common requests:  'getblock' simply returns a full block, including all transactions.\n\nClosing, as consensus seems to point elsewhere.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2421#issuecomment-19912040,19912040,
