dcousens,2015-11-19T02:33:06Z,@laanwj maybe this should be done by `LogPrint`? Automatically prepend the category to the message?\nThoughts?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7058#discussion_r45293113,45293113,src/zmq/zmqnotificationinterface.cpp
jmcorgan,2015-11-19T03:12:59Z,"Do you think the zmq system merits its own debug category?  It's really the the first instance of a ""notification"" system, which might include other methods in the future.\n\nIt's not that big a deal; just double checking if this is the right way to go.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7058#discussion_r45295172,45295172,src/init.cpp
dcousens,2015-11-19T03:15:53Z,"@jmcorgan this is already the case, I'm just exposing what is already there.\nIf you want rename it to `notifications:`, sure.\n\nThese messages are helpful when debugging, absolutely.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7058#discussion_r45295327,45295327,src/init.cpp
jonasschnelli,2015-11-19T07:15:07Z,"Right, this could be done by `LogPrint` (autoprint the category). But until then, it is probably best if we keep it consistent with other `LogPrint`'s.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7058#discussion_r45308499,45308499,src/zmq/zmqnotificationinterface.cpp
MarcoFalke,2015-11-19T11:10:44Z,Agree to get this done in the LogPrint method.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7058#discussion_r45327701,45327701,src/zmq/zmqnotificationinterface.cpp
laanwj,2015-11-24T09:45:25Z,"@jmcorgan IMO it does. I think it's good to have different modules use a different debug category, even if they belong to the same logical grouping. Debugging is either very targeted 'I want to see this debug message' or 'I want to see all debugging messages', rarely in between.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7058#discussion_r45713959,45713959,src/init.cpp
