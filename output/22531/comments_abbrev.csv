dongcarl,2021-07-22 21:32:08,"Thanks, just pushed up a branch that did what the first commit did but saw this more extensive one.\n\nI'd like to use `all.SHA256SUMS` instead of `codesigned.SHA256SUMS` if possible as it's clear that that is the one to be distributed in the release process. Incidentally if we have more finer distinctions in the future, it'll always be `all.SHA256SUMS` that needs to be distributed.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22531#issuecomment-885249188,885249188,
achow101,2021-07-22 21:51:32,I've changed it to make `all.SHA256SUMS`.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22531#issuecomment-885258809,885258809,
achow101,2021-07-22 22:50:58,@dongcarl has informed me that replacing `comm` with `diff` is not the correct way to solve the erroneous failure since it's actually due to the line endings rather than line order.
