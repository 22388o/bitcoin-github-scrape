    "body": "I would love to see this rebased and merged! I'm going to be using this functionality for an upcoming new version of [Coinpunk](http://coinpunk.org), to support client-side encryption for private keys, so that `bitcoind` becomes a listener, and cannot spend any of the user's money. This is a huge linchpin in my new version, and it enables this capability for people developing web services and offline clients that use a central `bitcoind` instance to keep up with the blockchain while they are offline. And of course cold storage wallets that generate the private keys on their own end.\n\nI won't be able to release the new Coinpunk until this is released, so it would be amazing if this commit could get into the next release. I don't think it's too dangerous, just because I believe it's not handling anything that could potentially lose bitcoins, but I could be mistaken. But it would be awesome.\n\nLet me know if I can help in any way. Thanks, you guys are awesome. :-)\n",

    "body": "Just thinking about an alternative to this: Set a wallet passphrase so that all the private keys are encrypted and then write a separate utility to overwrite the encrypted private keys with zeros in the wallet file. Since bitcoind is not going to access the keys anyway while they're encrypted, it shouldn't matter that they're actually zeros. So that will effectively produce watch-only addresses. However, it still wouldn't be possible to add new watch-only addresses via rpc, which this patch can do.\n\nBy the way, could a slightly cleaner implementation of this be to store watch-only addresses as normal keys (except where the encrypted private key is cleared) instead of adding the new \"address\" data type in the walletdb?\n",

The last thing Bitcoin needs right now is another high profile wallet theft fiasco.\n\nThis is a very important and very significant security upgrade, that I believe will dramatically lead to the improvement of security across the board, for many different types of applications. To provide analogies, this could be as important to bitcoind security as ProPolice was to buffer overflow prevention, or PBKDF2 was to password hashing.\n\nPlease consider including this in the next release of bitcoind. Do it for the people that have lost a lot of money to server wallet thefts. _Do it for the children._\n\n:wink: \n",

    "body": "@luke-jr I'm cool with HD Wallets, but HD Wallets are a long way away. This is a light, simple patch to solve a very big problem, that enables some major new infrastructure for bitcoin. I tried to rebase it and I got very close, I think someone with knowledge of the bitcoin source would very easily be able to rebase this. The biggest hurdle was the @sipa (I think?) refactor of `keystore.cpp`. The rest was just really simple merges.\n",

    "body": "For those of us in the bitcoind camp using an old unstable master so we can get `importaddress`, I have merged `importaddress` with @runeksvendsen's hint of ec0004a here: https://github.com/kyledrake/bitcoin/tree/importaddressupdate\n\nSince I posted on this pull request, I have gotten emails from people using this commit **in production**, because there is no other alternative. Which makes me excited about its potential to improve bitcoin security, but also terrified because they are using it with unstable bitcoind. It would be really great if someone was able to look at this, I really doubt it would take more than a few hours for a seasoned member of the glorious, highly talented bitcoin development team to resolve the merge conflicts on it (@sipa? @jgarzik?).\n",
