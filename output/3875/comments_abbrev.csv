sipa,2014-03-15T03:50:19Z,Serving the same 30 seeds to the whole network for a full minute seems a lot. That could lead to many many connections to those 30 peers...\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3875#issuecomment-37716478,37716478,
ayeowch,2014-03-15T04:03:35Z,@sipa What is the recommended number of nodes should we return? I believe all the current seeders are using 60 seconds TTL as well except for bitseed.xf2.org.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3875#issuecomment-37716665,37716665,
sipa,2014-03-15T04:13:02Z,"Mine also uses TTL=60s, but returns different results for every request.\n\nI guess the extra variation in software running it is a benefit, though.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3875#issuecomment-37716818,37716818,
ayeowch,2014-03-15T05:53:56Z,"@sipa I have reconfigured the seeder to flush the zone file every 5 seconds instead of 60. Record's TTL stays at 60s. So new request after 5 seconds gets another set of nodes from the sample of stable nodes. Also, I have increased the number of published nodes per request from 30 to 60 per record type.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3875#issuecomment-37718247,37718247,

ayeowch,2014-03-15T07:28:44Z,@gmaxwell Only nodes with protocol version 70001 (i.e. >= /Satoshi:0.7.x/) are taken into account. Nodes are considered stable if they have been up (connected to the crawler) for more than 24 hours. The claimed height of published nodes must be greater or equal to that of the instance of Bitcoin-Qt that runs locally on the server when the snapshot was taken.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3875#issuecomment-37719615,37719615,
