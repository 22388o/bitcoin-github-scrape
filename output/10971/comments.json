    "body": "After experimenting with this for far too long, I've decided that it just doesn't make sense to tie sse42 to CXXFLAGS.\r\n\r\nGitian, for example, sets the CXXFLAGS manually in order to enable debugging. Linux distros will probably set them to \"-O2\" by default to reduce the object size. Gentoo will have some value set by the user's flags. Etc. All of those would end up with quietly disabled crc optimizations.\r\n\r\nInstead, I think we should just enable this flags if they work, possibly behind configure switches.\r\n\r\nFor 0.15, I propose that we just keep it simple and always check for sse42, and punt worrying about the warnings until 0.16.",
