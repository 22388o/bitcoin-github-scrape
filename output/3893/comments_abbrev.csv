Maybe make the number\nlocale configurable separately from the language and default to US.\n\nTodo: make sure that this doesn't affect URI amount parsing.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3893#issuecomment-37979365,37979365,

I thought I handled this by always parsing the amounts in the C locale ( https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3893/files#diff-a459a939be4fe065dd5f64ab60bb30d0R136 ), but something is going wrong.

leofidus,2014-03-23T15:38:31Z,"I agree with @luke-jr on this one. If we want more readable large numbers, using thin spaces as a thousand seperator is a better option imho since it's unambigious between all locales.\n\nAlso, how does locale-aware parsing affect me if I use the old format?
