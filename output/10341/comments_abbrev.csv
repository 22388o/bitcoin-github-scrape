theuni,2017-05-05T14:17:19Z,This points out that we don't have a strong enough api contract to support an external UniValue :\,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10341#issuecomment-299476720,299476720,
gmaxwell,2017-05-07T23:40:15Z,I recommend we instead threshold the univalue version.  They have been security issues in older versions... esp since as a library I don't believe it's actually maintained.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10341#issuecomment-299744083,299744083,

laanwj,2017-05-11T17:03:08Z,"This makes the code slightly better readable so seems OK to me.\n\nA minimum threshold for univalue would be a sane thing to do though. I didn't know we supported external univalue at all.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10341#issuecomment-300853237,300853237,
