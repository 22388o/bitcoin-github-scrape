apoelstra,2014-06-03T04:04:30Z,"Thanks for the suggestion, @luke-jr. I've updated the PR to use <code>uiInterface.ThreadSafeMessageBox</code> which is the logging function used for other failures in <code>init.cpp</code>, and also added a URL to a wiki page describing the problem and available workarounds.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4277#issuecomment-44917885,44917885,
laanwj,2014-06-03T06:52:32Z,"Instead of deferring this to the last moment and create a dependency of the key.c/h on UI interface, I'd prefer adding this check (and potentially other sanity checks, see #4081) earlier in the init sequence, for example in AppInit2 before any key objects are instantiated.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4277#issuecomment-44925814,44925814,
apoelstra,2014-06-03T19:15:03Z,"Ok, I've refreshed the PR; I left the assertion in place and added an <code>InitSanityCheck</code> function to init.cpp which does the check. The failure is now both clean and immediate (the old assertion failure took several seconds to trigger on my machine). The function <code>InitSanityCheck</code> is also a clear place to add the additional checks suggested in #4081.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4277#issuecomment-45007810,45007810,
