gmaxwell,2019-02-28T15:26:21Z,"I'd love to be making more connect attempts to distinct hosts at once, but I'm not super eager to add more threads: each one implies quite a few megabytes of additional memory usage (both res and virt, from the per thread stacks and the malloc pools) which are problematic on low memory systems.  Perhaps it's ultimately worth it, but have you looked into just making the connects() non-blocking and ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15502#issuecomment-468314537,468314537,

(Perhaps by just passing in a filter to addrman to tell it to return only hosts where netgroup%threads==thread ?)\n\nIt's putting the addresses being tried in `vFastConnect` which contains a bool/address pair.
