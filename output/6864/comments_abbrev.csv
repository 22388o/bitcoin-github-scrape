jonasschnelli,2015-10-22T11:06:37Z,"IIRC the issue from #5898 was mainly the `px` based font size.\nSwitching back to ""Monospace"" could be possible, but needs broad testing and also acceptance.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6864#discussion_r42735252,42735252,src/qt/rpcconsole.cpp

jonasschnelli,2015-11-03T19:12:07Z,"I also preferred to non-`* 8.5 / 9` solution. But i have ACKed this solution because it might slightly reduce the size of mostly-oversized monospace fonts.

MarcoFalke,2015-11-03T19:16:42Z,"@luke-jr  `fixedFontInfo.pointSize()` is `12`, so way too large. Also, people were requesting that the fixed pitch font is exactly the same size as the previous default font.\n\n@jonasschnelli `QFontInfo(QFont()).pointSize()` is `9`, often. So we get a `8.5pt` in this case instead of a longer float.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6864#discussion_r43792978,43792978,src/qt/rpcconsole.cpp
luke-jr,2015-11-03T20:09:05Z,"@MarcoFalke If fixedFontInfo.pointSize() is wrong, then that should be fixed instead.
