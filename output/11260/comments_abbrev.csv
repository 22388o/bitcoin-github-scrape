practicalswift,2017-09-06T23:25:01Z,"Concept ACK regarding the assertion\n\nIs it due to performance reasons we want to run scripted diff only for the `arm-linux-gnueabihf` build (`CHECK_DOC=1`)? One benefit of doing the scripted diff for all builds is to make it apparent from the build status overview that all builds fails. If only `arm-linux-gnueabihf` is red when a scripted diff fails it might look like a platform specific issue",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11260#issuecomment-327639039,327639039,
MarcoFalke,2017-09-06T23:28:58Z,No need to run an arch independent check on each arch. If you feel like factoring out the CHECK_DOC into a different build stage (c.f. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/11004#issuecomment-321404956); Go for it!,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11260#issuecomment-327639592,327639592,
