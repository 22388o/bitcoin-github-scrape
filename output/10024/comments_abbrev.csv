jnewbery,2017-03-17T22:39:08Z,"Thanks @TheBlueMatt . I originally didn't add logging to proxy_test.py because it was printing in `__int__()`, which is before logging has been set up. Looking a bit closer, it's very easy to move the logic from `__init__()` into `setup_nodes()`, which I think is where it belongs.\n\nnulldummy.py was just an oversight.\n\nI'll squash these commits once they've been reviewed.\n\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10024#issuecomment-287488626,287488626,
