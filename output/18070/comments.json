    "body": "A specific problem I had, that seems general enough, was that I was missing a couple of folders in my system. The original error I got was:\r\n\r\n```\r\n==> Pouring python-3.7.6_1.catalina.bottle.tar.gz\r\nError: An unexpected error occurred during the `brew link` step\r\nThe formula built, but is not symlinked into /usr/local\r\nPermission denied @ dir_s_mkdir - /usr/local/Frameworks\r\nError: Permission denied @ dir_s_mkdir - /usr/local/Frameworks\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn hindsight, it does show an issue with trying to create one of the folders. I didn't catch that initially.\r\n\r\nThe fix is:\r\n```\r\nsudo mkdir -p /usr/local/Frameworks /usr/local/sbin\r\nsudo chown -R $(whoami) /usr/local/Frameworks /usr/local/sbin\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems like anyone who has never installed some of the dependencies before will run into this hiccup. Would it be worth to preemptively ask everyone to:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo mkdir ...\r\nsudo chown ...\r\nbrew install ...\r\n```\r\n?",
