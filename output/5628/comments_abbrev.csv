jonasschnelli,2015-01-13T07:45:01Z,@luke-jr: I know. It's minimal.\nBut have a look at the screenshot/mockup below.\nI really care about margins and paddings.\nThe right unused margin in the status bar always poked me.\n\n![github](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/178464/5717386/432f6498-9b00-11e4-836c-937a3830f744.png)\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5628#issuecomment-69706832,69706832,

laanwj,2015-01-19T16:30:36Z,Seems a bit like the UI equivalent of premature optimization. Isn't the point of a size grip to communicate that the window can be resized?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5628#issuecomment-70521679,70521679,
jonasschnelli,2015-01-19T16:55:31Z,@laanwj: Right. But the grip is only visible on windows. On Linux and Mac there is a unused space to the right.\n\nOn window there are many apps where the grip is not visible but the window is also resizable.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5628#issuecomment-70525791,70525791,
