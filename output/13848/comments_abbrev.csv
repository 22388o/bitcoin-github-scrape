laanwj,2018-08-02T09:56:25Z,I don't think this message makes much sense when the wallet is disabled? It talks about a wallet and spending coins.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13848#issuecomment-409873313,409873313,

promag,2018-08-03T11:05:19Z,FYI in #11826 there is discussion about changing the overlay and I was planning to work on that after 0.17 branch.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13848#issuecomment-410220824,410220824,
jonasschnelli,2018-08-05T18:57:12Z,I think the modal overlay with the sync-info should show but the warning part (icon / text) should only be visible when a wallet is loaded.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13848#issuecomment-410540231,410540231,

laanwj,2018-08-29T13:21:45Z,"> Seems like it would be better to just add the missing data to the main Information tab.\n\nIn principle that's per-wallet and supposed to have wallet information, not node/global information.\nThat's why there is no other such information there.\nThough there would certainly be place for it...",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13848#issuecomment-416950798,416950798,
