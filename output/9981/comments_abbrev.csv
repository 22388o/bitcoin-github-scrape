A full solution would need:\n* A way for lightweight client to request witnesses.\n* A way for full nodes to prove that the provided witnesses are part of the block (by giving the branches of the witness tree and the coinbase).\n* A way to match against witnesses like your PR does, but optionally.\n\nWithout having all 3 pieces, you're just going to degrade the",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9981#issuecomment-285996996,285996996,
