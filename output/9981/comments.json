A full solution would need:\r\n* A way for lightweight client to request witnesses.\r\n* A way for full nodes to prove that the provided witnesses are part of the block (by giving the branches of the witness tree and the coinbase).\r\n* A way to match against witnesses like your PR does, but optionally.\r\n\r\nWithout having all 3 pieces, you're just going to degrade the Bloom filter (even) faster than before, without any way the client can use the result.",
