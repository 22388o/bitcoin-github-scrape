ryanofsky,2019-04-05T16:23:38Z,"This code is pretty tucked away and it seems like it nobody is going to know these debug targets exist if they aren't documented somewhere. Ideally I think you'd be able to go to the depends directory and run ""make help"" and get basic usage information that mentions these. Maybe something to implement in a future PR.\n\nFor now at least the new targets can be listed with some stackoverflow shell",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15446#discussion_r272658136,272658136,depends/funcs.mk
