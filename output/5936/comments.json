    "body": "So... an extra parameter is kind of a pain because if we add any additional ones after it it becomes a pain to have to dummy out this one; so we should take care to make sure that this is really the order that we want the arguments in, and that maybe we don't want something else first.  One way around this would be to take an array for additional named arguments.\n\nIs there a reason that the locktime=N parameter of bitcoin-tx doesn't already accommodate this functionality? You can createrawtransaction then use bitcointx to set the locktime.   Though right now it doesn't set the sequence numbers but perhaps it should.\n",
