gmaxwell,2014-05-06T08:46:35Z,ACK. We've had periodic bouts of complaints on IRC (and github issues) from a mix of broken/trouble making nodes and also people just getting confused when the data is days stale due to long lived connections.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4134#issuecomment-42279202,42279202,
