ryanofsky,2017-10-24T13:30:23Z,"> assert ... not in ...;?\n\nAssert statements are skipped when python is run in optimized mode. I only use assert statements in tests when asserting conditions that indicate bugs in test setup, as opposed to conditions that could be caused by bugs in the code under test. (If you're familiar with google test framework, this is the distinction between CHECK and ASSERT_TRUE).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11552#discussion_r146559305,146559305,test/functional/wallet-accounts.py
