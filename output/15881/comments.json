    "body": "My instinct here is that our design goal should be to make the p2p connections in regtest be more like mainnet, and not less.  We already have a problem that in regtest, we don't exercise our networking code enough (as mentioned in #14210 -- an issue I opened after I got the impression that many people were unaware of our code-coverage deficiences with respect to p2p behavior).  So adding more special cases seems like it's going in the wrong direction.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand it would be great for the tests to run faster.  My suggestion would be to adopt an approach more like #15858 was trying to do, where we leave bitcoind unchanged but choose to make certain tests opt-out of testing the p2p behavior.  I think that also makes it easier to reason about what a test is testing, if you can see clearly in the test what parts of the code are being exercised (rather than implicitly relying on some non-standard  behaviors we've opted bitcoind into in the test framework).\r\n\r\nI only briefly looked at #15858 so far but I think it seemed to be going in the right direction.  Having individual tests be modified one-by-one to opt into a faster behavior seems fine to me; reviewers can determine whether the code coverage change is logical or not based on what the test is doing and what the rest of the test suite already covers.  The only caveat I'd add is that I think we should make it more explicit whether a call to `sync_mempools()` is exercising the p2p sync logic or not, to make the tests more readable and understandable.\r\n\r\nAs an aside, I think someone should just add a test that tests poisson delays -- that is currently possible in our test framework (inbounds can be tested via mininode, outbounds can be tested with multiple bitcoind's because there's no difference in our p2p logic between addnode peers and regular outbound peers, I believe).\r\n\r\nSo I'm a weak concept NACK on adding functionality to bitcoind that allows changing the relay delays; I'm a strong concept NACK on defaulting all our functional tests into special-cased behavior (if we were to go with this approach, I think we should only opt-in tests that we choose to exercise non-standard behavior on, rather than take a blanket approach).\r\n\r\nRegarding parallelization, I think the point is that perhaps developers can immediately start saving their own time (and achieve the same benefits of this PR) by just increasing the number of simultaneous jobs they run with?  I often run `test_runner.py` with the defaults myself, and this PR has reminded me that I could cut the time down significantly by adding more parallelization, so I will try to remember that going forward.",

I don't see how compilation could be sped up any time soon (it would probably require getting rid of the boost hpp includes and the serialize.h includes, neither trivially possible).

    "body": "> The response to \"the tests run slow\" shouldn't be \"just run more of them in parallel\"\r\n\r\nWhy not?  At least to the extent that slowness is due to sleeps in the protocol design then running them in parallel is a perfectly reasonable response to it.\r\n\r\n> but if there are no tests for delay, what is the point of keeping delay in tests at all? If it breaks, no one will notice it anyway.\r\n\r\nBecause they are part of the system.  The tests (for the most part) are system tests.   Even if there is not a specific test for the delay behaviour in most possible ways that it could break, if it broke, it would break the test.  Consider, if a rare crasher bug, say a divide by zero, were introduced in PoissonNextSend then currently the tests could eventually catch it even though there is no direct test-- but if that code was never run it could never be caught by the tests.\r\n\r\nAlso, having additional conditional behaviour in the codebase complicates the code -- opportunities for confusion, time wasted fixing bugs (or testing code) which is specific to the test environment. What happens when some bool sign sense gets flipped and the delay skipping gets turned on in mainnet? Or when there is a race in getdata handling that doesn't work without delays?  Additional conditional test only code also frustrates efforts to improve the code by hitting high multiple-condition-decision branch coverage (because of dead production code in tests, and dead test code in coverage).  \r\n\r\nThree times faster is no joke.  But the further we make the tested system less like the actual system the less useful the tests become. We could make them infinity faster by removing them completely...\r\n\r\n@jnewbery 's one line version is a lot more attractive. And while I wouldn't seen any problem if some particularly tx-relay-serailization-delay sensitive tests used it, we really shouldn't be doing the bulk of our system testing that way simply because its different from production. We should be trying to minimize the difference to production...   What we could do is identify tests where the p2p behaviour is irrelevant to the test itself and the source of a large delay and bypass it for just those tests. However, we should take care that doing so doesn't leave some part of the production system unused in the tests (e.g. we shouldn't do this to all tests that relay transactions...).\r\n\r\nI feel like maybe we've lost the distinction between system and unit testing, and we're asking tests which are structurally system tests to work and perform like unit tests. In general I'm not the biggest fan of unit testing and prefer to achieve as much tests via system tests as possible, but when performance considerations are causing us to test increasingly more modified versions of the system it might make sense to split things up and stop trying to use the whole system when what we're trying to do is a unit test.",
