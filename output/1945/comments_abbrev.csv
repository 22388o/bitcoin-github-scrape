centromere,2012-10-22T06:54:08Z,All I did was replace the port_posix.h file in bitcoin with the one from the latest commit of leveldb. It seems to me like the cleanest option.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1945#issuecomment-9654062,9654062,
luke-jr,2012-10-22T06:57:51Z,"Note the bitcoin codebase doesn't work in big endian at all right now. Also note that despite many headers/software making the assumption that endian is fixed at build time, that assumption is apparently not necessarily true in theory.\n\nThe cleanest option is to use a git submodule to embed LevelDB, at least until it's possible to build/link with system LevelDB.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1945#issuecomment-9654129,9654129,
