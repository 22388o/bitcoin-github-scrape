Diapolo,2013-02-18T12:31:43Z,"@gavinandresen \n\nI tried `ld -z,relro`, which leads to:\nld: unrecognized option '-z,relro'\nand `ld -z,now`, which leads to:\nld: unrecognized option '-z,now'\n\nSo these seem to be non present with MinGW. But before these were a QMAKE_CXXFLAGS and now you are using these with LIBS, which is correct? Just asking, as I don't know better :).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2311#discussion_r3047345,3047345,bitcoin-qt.pro
