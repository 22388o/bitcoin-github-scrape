gavinandresen,2014-11-14T18:53:53Z,ACK.\n\nThinking out loud: it would be super spiffy if changes to our .py files were automagically run through one or more of the python lint tools as part of the Travis pull-testing process.....\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5282#issuecomment-63111391,63111391,
theuni,2014-11-14T21:31:01Z,"@gavinandresen That does sound nice. Do you happen to know of any tools that will do linting at runtime? With all the JIT work these days, I'd think there would be something to handle it in one step, so that we could get error-checking as a side-effect of running as usual.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5282#issuecomment-63132149,63132149,

laanwj,2014-11-17T10:21:19Z,Does travis have a way to display warnings? I wouldn't want all the tests to fail because of a false positive in some linter. My experience is that they're quite false-positive-heavy.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5282#issuecomment-63284438,63284438,

theuni,2014-11-17T18:23:50Z,"@laanwj You can check the build logs, but I assume you're asking if we can separate out real warnings from the rest of the log? Afaik that's not possible atm.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5282#issuecomment-63350010,63350010,
