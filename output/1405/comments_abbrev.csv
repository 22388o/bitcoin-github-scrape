TheBlueMatt,2012-06-07T22:17:33Z,"Finally got around to benchmarking IBD using -autoprune, it was a tiny sliver faster than master (just under 5%) -loadblock'ing to the current block, but its blkindex.dat was only 351MB instead of 554MB.  \nThus, I made -autoprune default and rebased.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1405#issuecomment-6189658,6189658,

TheBlueMatt,2012-07-05T20:17:05Z,Closing in favor of an (eventual) ultraprune.  No point in merging a stop-gap that conflicts with an actual solution.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1405#issuecomment-6789452,6789452,

laanwj,2012-06-13T08:36:14Z,"If you add `TODO:` in the comment, many code editors will show it in an overview. Might be useful, and more clear to readers that it isn't just commented out code (otherwise, someone that doesn't know might remove it).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1405#discussion_r974400,974400,src/db.cpp
