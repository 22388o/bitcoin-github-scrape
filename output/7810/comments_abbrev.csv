paveljanik,2016-04-25T16:04:45Z,"Hmm, I think there should be no `AlertNotifyOnce` at all. We should warn always (there is one exception - once per day alert for network partition - implemented already), the user will see the last warning only. If he wants to see previous warnings, he can grep the log and/or use `-alertnotify`.\n\nAlternatively, we can store some number of previous warnings and provide them via some RPC/GUI.\n\n`",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7810#issuecomment-214419486,214419486,

And the boolean really belongs in UpdateTip, as it relates to this specific case.\n\nI disagree with removing that logic completely - the idea is to warn _once, and at most once_ when the rules changed in a (for this implementation) unknown way.
