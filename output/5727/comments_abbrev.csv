gmaxwell,2015-01-31T02:31:28Z,"Excessive is misleading.  I would be glad if we changed to avoid any language that was derogatory towards anyone, but I think a different word would be better.  Paying $10 for a soft drink would be excessive especially if one was available down the street for $2,  paying $10,000 would be completely nonsensical. It's the latter the software is trying to prevent. (It doesn't prevent merely excessive",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5727#issuecomment-72300625,72300625,
daira,2015-01-31T02:32:26Z,Note also that there's a source-level backward incompatibility for anything compiled against Bitcoin Core that relies on `WalletModel::InsaneFee`. (There's no binary incompatibility since `WalletModel::ExcessiveFee` will take the same integer value.) If necessary I can add an `InsaneFee = ExcessiveFee` alias to avoid this.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5727#issuecomment-72300657,72300657,

gmaxwell,2015-01-31T02:37:51Z,"Absurd sounds great to me, but you might want to wait a bit to see if anyone else comments (I don't want to make you iterate on this if other people have opinions that differ greatly from mine).\n\nI don't think we mind the incompatibility, though we are library structured, it's not a supported thing for external applications yet.

daira,2015-01-31T23:12:41Z,"@MineForeman : @gmaxwell said that ""excessive"" was not the intended meaning, since the check doesn't prevent fees that are merely excessive.
