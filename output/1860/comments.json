I think the use case for those is separate from this issue, so I'd leave that for another network service bit.\n\n@mikehearn: service bits have to indicate (positive) support for a feature, as they are ORed together when storing in the address book. That can change too of course, but it's certainly easier if that weren't necessary.\n\nOriginally, I thought about adding two separate bits, NODE_VALIDATION (validation/relay of blocks and transactions, maintaining a mempool, keeping UTXO set, serving (very) recent blocks) and NODE_ARCHIVE (providing old blocks), and have NODE_NETWORK imply both. This proposal accomplishes the same, but forces every archive node to be a validation node as well. Not a problem as such, but I'm not sure that's necessary.\n",
