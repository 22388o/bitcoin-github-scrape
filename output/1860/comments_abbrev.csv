sipa,2012-09-28T14:20:53Z,"@gmaxwell I think a merkle-UTXO tree is further ahead than the need for separation between archive nodes and full nodes. I think the use case for those is separate from this issue, so I'd leave that for another network service bit.\n\n@mikehearn: service bits have to indicate (positive) support for a feature, as they are ORed together when storing in the address book.
