GamerSg,2016-02-28T13:59:59Z,@MarcoFalke That would require C++11 which i believe at this point is not supported yet in the codebase.\n\n@jonasschnelli Apparently this is much trickier than it would seem to be. Straightforward way would be to use vector but would be kind of redundant for a const array.

laanwj,2016-03-03T13:24:31Z,"I don't like exposing this array using `extern`, it is an implementation detail.
