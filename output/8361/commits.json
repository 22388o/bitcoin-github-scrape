As\n+  this resulted in chains of dependent transactions being reordered, it\n+  systematically hurt transaction relay. The relay code was redesigned in PRs\n+  #7840 and #8082, and now always batches transactions announcements while also\n+  sorting them according to dependency order. This significantly reduces orphan\n+  transactions. To compensate for the removal of instant relay, the frequency of\n+  batch sending was doubled for outgoing peers.\n+\n+- Since PR 7840 the BIP35 mempool command is also subject to batch processing.\n+\n+- The maximum size of orphan transactions that are kept in memory until their\n+  ancestors arrive has been raised in PR 8179 from 5000 to 99999 bytes. They\n+  are now also removed from memory when they are included in a block, conflict\n+  with a block, and time out after 20 minutes.\n+\n+- We respond at most once to a getaddr request during the lifetime of a\n+  connection since PR 7856.\n+\n+- Connections to peers who have recently been the first one to give us a valid\n+  new block or transaction are protected from disconnections since PR 8084.\n+\n Low-level RPC changes\n ----------------------\n "
