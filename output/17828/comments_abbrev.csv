practicalswift,2020-01-02 17:25:25,@promag I agree the name does not feel perfect. Have any suggestions w.r.t. naming? :) I'm trying to mimic `bool error(…)`. Perhaps `bool error_with_category(…)` or `bool error_with_debug(…)`?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17828#issuecomment-570277999,570277999,

MarcoFalke,2020-03-06 15:13:36,"I think there is a tradeoff. IIRC `-debug` is disabled by default, disabling all debug categories. Thus, the debug log is pretty much useless to find the root cause of an issue after a crash or other misbehavior if all log statements are put into a category. Still, it makes sense to put log statments into categories to make it possible to disable or enable them specifically.\n\nI think we should",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17828#issuecomment-595812442,595812442,

practicalswift,2020-03-06 15:26:45,@MarcoFalke I'm not sure I follow: which of the error messages touched in this PR do you think should be shown to users not running `-debug`?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17828#issuecomment-595818689,595818689,
MarcoFalke,2020-03-06 19:34:09,"@practicalswift Any of them. Assume a user has a crashed node (or just high memory usage, high CPU usage, or any other anomaly).
