laanwj,2020-10-14 08:55:04,"The reason for disabling gmp by default is that the releases should not have a dependency on gmp. There are some good reasons to have the default configure options equivalent (or as close as possible) to the release options. Especially for something that affects consensus so directly if there was a bug in this less-tested path.\n\nConcept ACK on being able to override it on demand though.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20121#issuecomment-708261333,708261333,
