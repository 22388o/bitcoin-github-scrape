jonasschnelli,2016-04-05T07:24:50Z,Travis error seems unrelated. Just re-kicked travis for this PR.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7798#issuecomment-205694684,205694684,
theuni,2016-04-05T07:40:20Z,"Maybe you'd like to print `$TRAVIS_COMMIT_RANGE`, so that it's immediately clear what was in the build? I believe it should print ""foo...bar"", which could be easily checked locally.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7798#issuecomment-205703281,205703281,
MarcoFalke,2016-04-05T10:31:19Z,Right now it should print \n\n```\ncommit $some_random_hash Merge: 30c2dd8 faef3b7\n```\n\nwhere 30c2dd8 should be in bitcoin/master and faef3b7 in the branch someone wants to merge. I think that is sufficient to quickly check that something went wrong.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7798#issuecomment-205747249,205747249,
MarcoFalke,2016-04-05T10:37:34Z,"> Travis error seems unrelated\n\nTravis is building random crap, which you can see by observing the commit ids:\n\n```\n$ echo $TRAVIS_COMMIT_LOG\ncommit 73c560fc0d92177e88ddd02f6ac628340b85688c Merge: 30c2dd8 4b1ea9a\n```\n\nwhere 30c2dd8 is the current HEAD and 4b1ea9a is some random commit. \n\nSo the travis error is ""related"" but unwanted.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7798#issuecomment-205750992,205750992,
