MarcoFalke,2019-11-19 18:29:12,"Not sure what the implications of removing this field are, as I don't have strong knowledge of the `getblocktemplate` BIP. Though, when this is removed, the documentation in `RPCHelpMan` should be updated as well. And maybe `aux` can be removed as well? \ncc @luke-jr ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17519#discussion_r348094985,348094985,src/rpc/mining.cpp
