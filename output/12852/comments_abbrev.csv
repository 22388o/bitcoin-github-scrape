petertodd,2018-04-05T05:08:35Z,"Yeah, this instruction is a bit misleading: it's not just enough to download that script, you also have to install OpenTimestamps. The easiest way to do that is simply run:\n\n    pip3 install opentimestamps-client",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12852#discussion_r179350828,179350828,contrib/devtools/README.md
