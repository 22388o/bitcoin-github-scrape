jnewbery,2017-09-28T21:11:22Z,"Looks good to me.\n\nAnother way to do this would be to add a second node to this test with `-mempoolreplacement=0`, and then in `test_simple_doublespend()` check that `self.nodes[0]` accepts the replacement and `self.nodes[1]` rejects it. There are a couple of advantages to doing it in that way:\n\n- doesn't introduce delay in stop-starting the node (multiple nodes are started in parallel)\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11407#issuecomment-332965233,332965233,

The last check I'm doing could definitely be racy, but I can't call self.sync_all() since the mempools are bound to diverge.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11407#issuecomment-333159101,333159101,
