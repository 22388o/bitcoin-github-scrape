michaelfolkson,2020-12-01 13:19:47,"Isn't that one of the reasons for fuzzing? That testers will initially fuzz different inputs and then highlight which inputs create an issue? Maybe I am misunderstanding what you mean by deterministic here...\n\nEveryone runs the same unit and functional tests. But fuzz testers at least in theory try different inputs?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20425#issuecomment-736546666,736546666,
MarcoFalke,2020-12-01 13:24:05,"Generation of the seeds itself by the fuzz engine doesn't have to be deterministic. And for most fuzz engines it isn't (unless you ask them to).\n\nSo yes, fuzz testers will run different inputs during generation. However, if they discover a crash with one input, the crash should be reproducible when the same input is run again (even on a different machine)",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20425#issuecomment-736548937,736548937,
