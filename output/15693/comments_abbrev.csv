ryanofsky,2019-04-04T14:40:15Z,"I don't understand what ""early exit to cache state means."" Is this a timeout trying to create a cache, or a timeout waiting for something else to create a cache? What cache is being referring to? Where is the cache stored? Where can I find the code that creates the cache? Where I can I find the code or config that determines whether the cache needs to be updated and recreates the cache?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15693#discussion_r272213208,272213208,.travis.yml
gkrizek,2019-04-04T15:41:53Z,"@ryanofsky Travis stores a `ccache` to speed up the builds. If the build takes too long Travis will kill the job and I don't think it keeps the cache around when it does that. So, in order to keep the cache for future builds, we kill the job ourselves. Then on a rerun we should have that cache so it runs faster.\n\nYou can see the cache config for Travis here:\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoi",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15693#discussion_r272243291,272243291,.travis.yml
