sturles,2015-11-12T12:39:52Z,"@morcos Correct, however your latest commit in #6134 depends on, and tries to work around the current mempool trimming bug in a way that only works for one special case.  A better approach would be to fix mempool trimming by making it aware of priority.  (As long as priority is a supported concept, if not priority should be removed entirely, not by introducing bugs to make it fail.)\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6997#issuecomment-156093745,156093745,
