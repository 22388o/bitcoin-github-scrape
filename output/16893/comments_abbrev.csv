ryanofsky,2019-09-17 11:40:34,"`~bitcoin` refers to the home directory of the bitcoin user, so I think the documentation is correct as is, and this change just makes it more ambiguous. But if people are less familiar with multi-user systems than they used to be and `~bitcoin` is confusing, maybe this change is an improvement. I just don't think it's a ""fix""",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16893#issuecomment-532183503,532183503,

laanwj,2019-09-17 13:47:28,"I also think there's limited added value to updating historical release notes, save for serious things such as missing credits or dangerous suggestions. In which case you'd also want to update them on the bitcoincore.org site. But for something that very slighly improves readability I think it's not worth it.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16893#issuecomment-532228618,532228618,
