Marco - why are we currently catching these errors instead of raising them?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11319#discussion_r138645585,138645585,test/functional/test_framework/mininode.py
MarcoFalke,2017-09-29T17:58:44Z,"@jnewbery As of faaa3c9b6546d9a64cece4ff0223f0b167feb6ff there was a `try,except,pass` in `handle_read` that ate all exceptions without notice. By adding the error print I didn't change behavior but added useful debug information.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11319#discussion_r141929376,141929376,test/functional/test_framework/mininode.py
