hebasto,2018-08-07T19:21:49Z,You're right (and I didn't catch it). But somehow help2man parses badly only the second line.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13905#discussion_r208355125,208355125,src/bitcoin-cli.cpp
hebasto,2018-08-07T21:03:25Z,@MarcoFalke more precisely: the `FormatParagraph` call makes `-stdin` option output _without_ two spaces between words; that's why help2man parses it without any issue.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13905#discussion_r208384537,208384537,src/bitcoin-cli.cpp
