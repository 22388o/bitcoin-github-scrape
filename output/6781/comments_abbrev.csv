laanwj,2015-10-26T08:08:26Z,I think it's slightly unexpected for this to be part of the responsibility of a function called `HtmlEscape`. Especially to do this only on fMultiLine - there's nothing inherently multiline about replacing spaces.\nIf this is still necessary with monospace - maybe add a separate flag for this step?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6781#discussion_r42966827,42966827,src/qt/guiutil.cpp
