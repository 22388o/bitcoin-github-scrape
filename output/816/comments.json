    "body": "Unfortunately we don't know the scope.\n\nWe observed checksum errors on p2pool. Forrest investigated and found this to be the cause through some lucky reasoning.   It appeared to be two distinct users, out of something like 150 using P2Pool at the time. So, I'd guess we could be looking at incidents rates between something like 1:10 and 1:100000 in the general bitcoin using population. There could also be port number differences that moot it.\n\nIf this were just some new feature in 0.6 I wouldn't even bother talking about it\u2014 if we found it to be an issue in practice we'd just issue new software. But because its a network wide synchronized hardcut its more troubling.  I think the bluematt pull request is prudent\u2014 it's better behavior even if this is a non-issue, and should cleanly improve this behavior\u2014  Perhaps we should keep this particular patch in our pocket in case things go pear shaped?\n\nLuke suggested we send an alert 24 hour ahead of the switch saying that an automated switchover was about to take place and advising people to visit bitcoin.org for the latest information. This sounds prudent to me, since if it does go poorly (due to the nat or other issues) we may not be able to send an alert to the impacted users.\n",
