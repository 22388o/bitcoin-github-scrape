luke-jr,2013-01-30T16:54:34Z,"I think I was asleep when I wrote this. The fReadOnly bug is real, but isn't fixed correctly in this case and only matters for read-only blk*.dat files, which have other problems not addressed herein.

sipa,2012-11-30T22:25:35Z,"Actually, the only sane way is keeping a fBlockDirty flag or so, setting it to true when a block is written, and then inside FlushBlockFile only sync the block file part if that flag is true (the undo file part should always be synced).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2042#discussion_r2283426,2283426,src/main.cpp
