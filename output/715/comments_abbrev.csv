luke-jr,2011-12-19T21:57:18Z,I love nonsensical NACKs. Especially on bugfixes.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/715#issuecomment-3210334,3210334,
gavinandresen,2011-12-19T22:42:02Z,"All right, NACK:  adds 40 lines of code and a bunch of confusing #ifdefs for no good reason.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/715#issuecomment-3210965,3210965,
luke-jr,2011-12-19T22:46:31Z,Adds 40 lines of code for complying with the community standard everyone accepted...\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/715#issuecomment-3211023,3211023,
TheBlueMatt,2011-12-20T01:20:48Z,"Complying with the standards as you read it (I dont read it that way, but whatever) doesnt take 40 lines anyway.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/715#issuecomment-3212741,3212741,
luke-jr,2012-01-11T21:50:37Z,"Indeed, it could be done in fewer if we had an unanimous consensus whether there should be a difference between how bitcoind and Bitcoin-Qt advertise themselves. But making it configurable so both camps can be happy does take slightly more code.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/715#issuecomment-3454309,3454309,
jgarzik,2012-02-03T22:25:35Z,"NAK also.  Current client has been out there with current behavior, making the new standard not as widely accepted as implied.  There are also disagreements over how one reads the standard.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/715#issuecomment-3805619,3805619,
luke-jr,2012-02-03T22:47:50Z,There is no current released client out there with the broken behaviour. Please merge this fix or reopen...\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/715#issuecomment-3805887,3805887,
sipa,2012-02-22T14:09:55Z,"This patch seems to change several things at once, but at least one is very reasonable imho, namely the fact that bitcoind now advertizes itself as Bitcoin-qt. A much simpler patch would allow fixing that.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/715#issuecomment-4104530,4104530,
sipa,2012-02-22T15:26:50Z,"Actually, what about just changing the version string to ""/Satoshi:0.6.0/"" ?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/715#issuecomment-4106048,4106048,
