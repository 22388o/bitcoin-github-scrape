ajweiss,2015-01-08T15:47:54Z,"I've been playing with this and it looks good to me for a short term fix, subject to the limitations discussed on IRC on 1/7 with respect to backoffs and ping timeouts being triggered at the hard 20m limit when ping replies get stuck behind a bunch of slow moving blocks.  Ran a full sync and several catch-ups from -7d with no issues.  Also verified that clients are indeed disconnected.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5608#issuecomment-69198095,69198095,

gmaxwell,2015-01-12T19:59:41Z,yup. But you were doomed by the zombies before that point anyways. (more seriously: you're guaranteed to fall behind: better to see no connections than to think you're up to date)\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5608#issuecomment-69634978,69634978,
