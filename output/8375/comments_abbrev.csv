jonasschnelli,2016-07-20T08:45:01Z,"Concept ACK. After having done multiple implementation of a subclasses of `CKeyStore` (`CHDKeyStore`), I think this ""new"" function should slowly be moved toward `CKeyStore` (or a subclass of it). The whole HD stuff could be kept there to not overpolute `CWallet` (because in general hierarchical key derivation can be wallet neutral). \n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8375#issuecomment-233889009,233889009,
