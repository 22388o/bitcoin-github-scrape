TheBlueMatt,2011-06-29T18:52:17Z,"No, that is the intention, but USE_UPNP is not always defined.  If you build using make -f makefile.unix USE_UPNP=\nie nothing after the =, it will undefine USE_UPNP and you are fine.  Please look through old bugs and two or three identical pull requests to this one.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/364#issuecomment-1469483,1469483,
