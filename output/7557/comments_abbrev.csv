morcos,2016-02-18T19:49:02Z,"This fails Travis because `checkdoc.py` doesn't recognize the way I'm adding the help messages now.  I used @jtimon's code that builds a vector of string pairs.  I'll wait for some direction on whether that is a refactor thats wanted and we need to change the check script or whether I should just hack in the help messages the old fashioned way.\n\nAs a side note, it wasn't clear to me how to easil",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7557#issuecomment-185887938,185887938,
MarcoFalke,2016-02-26T10:02:18Z,@morcos I am sorry for the inconvenience and I am happy to fix the travis issue after you explain why the `AppendMessagesOpt()` wrapper is useful here.\n\n(It should be easier to identify the travis issue after #7455)\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7557#issuecomment-189201796,189201796,
morcos,2016-02-26T16:29:26Z,@MarcoFalke I don't have a strong opinion on `AppendMessagesOpt`.  I do really like moving some of the policy configuration out of main and into policy code.  I think there could be a lot of other command line options moved afterwards if we like this idea.  I tried to follow the style @jtimon had used since he seems to be most involved in refactoring work.  I'm happy to rewrite that part of this p,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7557#issuecomment-189358338,189358338,

morcos,2016-02-26T18:13:34Z,@jtimon I need to do some work around minRelayTxFee because it is broken now in CTxMemPool (supposed to respect the command line option but is hard coded) and I was having same problem in the fee filter code.  So I'd like to get something merged to do this policy encapsulation so we can fix that properly and probably add a second variable for the incremental relay rate.\n\nI have no strong opinion,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7557#issuecomment-189404904,189404904,
jtimon,2016-02-26T20:54:39Z,"> The reason I broke off mempool policy separately...\n\nAnother option would be to start CPolicy and CDefaultPolicy like in #6423 , but just with the GetMinRelayFeeRate() method instead of ApproveTx [ from IsStandardTx ] and ApproveTxInputs [from  AreInputsStandard ]. And doing it in policy/policy, no need to have two separate files and classes.\n\nI'm assuming this minRelayFee will remain static",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7557#issuecomment-189479930,189479930,
