This provides two immediate benefits:\n+\n+- **Elimination of malleability:** Segregating the witness allows both\n+  existing software and upgraded software that receives transactions to\n+  calculate the transaction identifier (txid) of segwit-using\n+  transactions without referencing the witness. This solves all known\n+  cases of unwanted third-party transaction malleability, which is a\n+  problem that makes programming Bitcoin wallet software more difficult\n+  and which seriously complicates the design of smart contracts for\n+  Bitcoin.\n+\n+- **Capacity increase:** Moving witness data outside of the traditional\n+  block structure (but still inside a new-style block structure) means\n+  new-style blocks can hold more data than older-style blocks, allowing\n+  a modest increase to the amount of transaction data that can fit in a\n+  block.\n+\n+Segwit also simplifies the ability to add new features to Bitcoin and\n+improves the efficiency of full nodes, which will help provide long-term\n+benefits to Bitcoin users.\n+\n+Activation for the segwit soft fork is being managed using BIP9 versionbits.\n+The earliest activation date is set to 15 November 2016 (UTC) and\n+its versionbit is bit 1.\n+\n+For more information about segwit, please see the [segwit FAQ][], the\n+[segwit wallet developers guide][] or BIPs [141][BIP141], [143][BIP143],\n+[144][BIP144], and [145][BIP145].  If you're a miner or mining pool\n+operator, please see the [versionbits FAQ][] for information about\n+signaling support for a soft fork.\n+\n+[Segwit FAQ]: https://bitcoincore.org/en/2016/01/26/segwit-benefits/\n+[segwit wallet developers guide]: https://bitcoincore.org/en/segwit_wallet_dev/\n+[BIP141]: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0141.mediawiki\n+[BIP143]: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0143.mediawiki\n+[BIP144]: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0144.mediawiki\n+[BIP145]: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0145.mediawiki\n+[versionbits FAQ]: https://bitcoincore.org/en/2016/06/08/version-bits-miners-faq/\n+\n+\n+Null dummy soft fork\n+-------------------\n+\n+Combined with the segwit soft fork is a soft fork that turns a\n+long-existing network relay policy into a consensus rule.  The\n+`OP_CHECKMULTISIG` and `OP_CHECKMULTISIGVERIFY` opcodes consume an extra\n+stack element (\"dummy element\") after signature validation. The dummy\n+element is not inspected in any manner, and could be replaced by any\n+value without invalidating the script.\n+\n+Because any value can be used for this dummy element, it's possible for\n+a third-party to insert data into other people's transactions, changing\n+the transaction's txid (called transaction malleability) and possibly\n+causing other problems.\n+\n+Since Bitcoin Core 0.10.0, nodes have defaulted to only relaying and\n+mining transactions whose dummy element was a null value (0x00, also\n+called OP_0).  The null dummy soft fork turns this relay rule into a\n+consensus rule both for non-segwit transactions and segwit transactions,\n+so that this method of mutating transactions is permanently eliminated\n+from the network.\n+\n+Signaling for the null dummy soft fork is done by signaling support\n+for segwit, and the null dummy soft fork will activate at the same time\n+as segwit.\n+\n+For more information, please see [BIP147][].\n+\n+[BIP147]: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0147.mediawiki\n \n Low-level RPC changes\n ---------------------"
