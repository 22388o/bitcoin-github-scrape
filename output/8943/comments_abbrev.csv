sipa,2016-10-17T17:59:54Z,"That's not technically correct, as it requires a signalling period and a fallow period (both 2016 blocks) after the start time (unless you assume 4032 blocks can be mined within 24 hours).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8943#discussion_r83698943,83698943,doc/release-notes.md

btcdrak,2016-10-17T18:04:41Z,Nov 15th is the earliest date that signalling can start. Earliest activation is likely to be ~28 days/4032 blocks from the next retarget after 15th Nov (estimated to be 20th Nov). I would hazard to be so specific.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8943#discussion_r83699819,83699819,doc/release-notes.md
btcdrak,2016-10-17T18:07:19Z,Still not technically correct. Tracking will start from the first retarget after the 15th.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8943#discussion_r83700339,83700339,doc/release-notes.md
harding,2016-10-17T18:10:43Z,Ok.  I'll edit again.  Sorry.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8943#discussion_r83700984,83700984,doc/release-notes.md
