In the future that may change, but for now we're stuck with defining at least some broad notion of what miner policy might be.\n\nAnyway, not adopting full-RBF is also a policy decision.\n",

    "body": "My preference would be to support multiple policies simultaneously (ie standard policy, testing policy, standard + full-RBF policy, etc). That would require something like https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5180 first.\nThat would clarify the notion that the standard policy is not part of the consensus rules (as well as providing more flexibility without having to necessarily expose a zillion \"standard policy runtime options\" like we're doing now).\nThat doesn't mean that full-RBF can't become part of the standard policy at some point. I would be in favor of that. I would also be in favor to make FSS-RBF part of the standard policy as soon as possible.\nSupporting multiple policies would also remove the need for independently maintaining advanced policies patches (like you're currently doing) even if it's decided not to make it the standard policy until a later date. At that point, you may still want to offer first seen and FSS-RBF as alternative policies that people who don't like full-RBF can run.\n",

    "body": "@jtimon Yeah, from a code point of view I also support making policy modular, but keep in mind the point of this pull-req is to set a date for planning purposes so the remaining vulnerable companies can migrate to less harmful, less dangerous, zeroconf technology in a way that minimizes losses and disruption; the situation now is such that for the vulnerable users even a small % of miners adopting full-RBF, or indeed, any change to mempool policy at all, is disruptive. For instance, even something as simple as miners increasing the minimum relay on their own nodes can be easily exploited for double-spends; a few do right now, which makes accepting zeroconf transactions with lowish fees very dangerous.\n\nIn short, I think you can make a good argument that this patch is actually a prerequisite to modular mempool policy.\n\nFWIW the patch does include a way to disable full-RBF indefinitely if the user chooses too by setting -fullrbfactivationtime=2147483647 Should I document this command-line argument and provide a more ergonomic way of doing it, like setting the activation time to -1 or 0 to disable? Heck, could call it -fullrbf with =0 being disabled, =1 enabled, and =<time> to set the switchover time manually.\n",

There's even people who like this but think that deploying it right now would be too risky for some businesses or want to give more time to instantly secure payments (possible with some payment channels like lightning channels).\nThis is certainly not ridiculous though, and that claim is not constructive.\n\nFortunately this is just node policy and not consensus rules. That means we can support multiple configurable policies simultaneously without causing consensus forks. Other implementations can of course maintain their own policies (a single one or several of them, that's up to their maintainers).\n\n@petertodd travis is not happy\n\nI don't like a switch-over date here. Policy doesn't require that kind of coordination. If full-RBF is going to be the default policy, just make it so for a  given major release and that's it.

    "body": "@jtimon \"Policy doesn't require that kind of coordination.\"\n\nIt does though! Unfortunately we have the problem that there's no way to get transactions to all but the largest, most centralized, miners other than via the p2p network. Without some pretty major changes to how that network works (e.g. hashcash) any transactions that aren't propagated by the majority of relay nodes just aren't going anywhere - why I had to define a RBF service bit and include a bunch of hacky preferential peering code in my full-RBF patch series.\n\nOne way to look at full-RBF is it's a common-denominator policy that supports other policies; full-RBF provides opportunities to get a larger range of transactions to miners who in turn may have their own policies in a DoS-resistant way by the simple measure of requiring fees to increase on each replacement, and it's significantly more efficient at doing that FSS-RBF. From a mining policy point of view, because it allows transactions to propagate that previously wouldn't have, it reduces the impact of the default policy on what miners can mine and what users can generate. Of course, from a code point of view I'd be happy to port it later to a pluggable policy system, but in the meantime, the code in this pull-req is well-tested and well-reviewed.\n\nAnyway, re: a switch-over date, in many ways that's us, as Bitcoin Core maintainers, saying \"by this date stop assuming everyone has the same mempool policy\" - the opposite approach of first-seen-dependent zeroconf requires nodes/miners to implement uniform policies to even begin to work. You are of course free to turn full-RBF off and I've made it easy to do so.\n\nre: travis, yeah, looks like it's broken again; other pull-reqs are failing too.\n",

    "body": "> Right, so why not just \"from this major release, stop assuming everyone else will have the same mempool policy\" instead?\n\nI think there's an important psychological component to actually having a date for people to have in their heads - it's a clear statement that we're giving the payment processing companies affected by the change 9 months (max) to prepare, but we're not going to delay longer for their benefit to the detriment of all other Bitcoin users. (where \"we're\" refers to miners to choose to take the advice of the Bitcoin Core maintainers and leave the default settings as-is)\n\nAn alternative would be to enable full-RBF for all relay nodes, and force miners to make a choice. (e.g. by disabling getblocktemplate until some kind of config setting was enabled) Ugly from a usability point of view, but doable. There's also a risk of DoS attack by doing that, as if very few miners support full-RBF you can fill up mempools/use-up-bandwidth with transactions that are unlikely to be mined. (same problem with double-spend relaying)\n",

I'm giving people a number of options here, so we'll see what we get re: consensus; if @jgarzik's switchover date idea doesn't get consensus removing it is just a few lines of code change, leaving code that does both types of RBF robustly and in a well-tested fashion.\n\n@D9B4BEF9 It would probably be best to save that kind of broader discussion about zeroconf for the mailing list, or perhaps the BIP.\n",

    "body": "@D9B4BEF9 @gavinandresen never said that there is 0 assumption of risk for merchants accepting zeroconf transactions. He just said that full-RBF will make the existing risk higher. The risk is not 0 and cannot be 0 regardless, this is just how bitcoin works (and this is why we need mining and proof of work security). I agree bitcoin should make everything possible to lower the double-spend risk as much as possible.\n\nIt is clear that full-RBF will make zeroconf a higher risk than it already is, and without zeroconf bitcoin can become a PITA for most merchants (10-60 minutes until you know if you can process an order or not). Less merchants accepting bitcoin has direct impact over the supply and demand market and obviously on the BTC/FIAT rate. I have great appreciation for @petertodd 's work in bitcoin, and totally agree RBF is helpful, but I am against full-RBF (at least don't make it the default behavior for relay nodes/miners) and would prefer FSS-RBF. If it matters, my business accepts zeroconf (for values of max 300$, thinking to raise the limit to 600$) and the double-spend losses are currently 0.\n",

    "body": "I just want to chime in from a payment processor (Coinbase) point of view. Full RBF is bad for Coinbase and bad for Bitcoin. If full RBF is turned on today by even a small set of nodes, Coinbase will have to stop accepting 0-conf for all orders. That means customers will need to wait for ~10 minutes for their order to confirm. This makes the checkout experience much worse than existing payment methods. It's hard enough trying to convince consumers and merchants to adopt Bitcoin as a payment method today. Without 0-conf, you can forget about Bitcoin adoption for payments getting any traction whatsoever.\n\nAccepting payments with 0-conf works ok today. It's not perfect, but it works. We do acknowledge that as block rewards go to zero, there will be more incentives for miners to implement some sort of RBF. But this will take years before that happens naturally. When it does happen, there will likely be alternative better 0-conf solutions that merchants and payment processors can switch to. There is **absolutely** no reason to speed that up. Seems silly that anyone would risk hurting the nascent Bitcoin payment system just to prove a point.\n",

    "body": "So it seems there's no complains about making FSS-RBF the standard policy instead of FS.\nWe can expose full-RBF as a non-standard policy (doing something similar to #5180), but since that seems controversial, it seems a better use of review time to get the uncontroversial parts merged first.\nI would even agree to make full-RBF the standard policy for 0.12 directly, but it doesn't look like that's going to happen soon and replacing FS with any other sane mempool replacement policy already moves the code the in the right direction for policy flexibility. Probably FS should be also maintained as an option.\n\nAnd again, big NACK on deployment schedules for policy code, either it becomes part of the standard policy or becomes an alternative policy (although those would require something like #6068 to get started, a factory like in #5180, and then more changes to generically encapsulate the mempool replacement).\nWithout making any moral judgement, maintaining and releasing versions with alternative policies yourself seems contradictory with proposing stricter than necessary restrictions to the use of the policy options when it comes to bitcoin/master.\n",
