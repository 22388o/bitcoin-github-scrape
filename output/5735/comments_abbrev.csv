As I learned the hard way when I tried to fiddle with it, that's what `-printtoconsole` is used for. It prints the log messages to stdout, so it is trivial to make the output - per line - end up in a system log. Some init service management systems will even do that by default.\n\nThis is another example of something that h",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5735#issuecomment-72800173,72800173,
