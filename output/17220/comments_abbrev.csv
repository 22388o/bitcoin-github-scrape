theStack,2019-10-23 00:24:34,nit: This could be put in one line by immediately assigning the script on the declaration: `CScript script = CScript() << OP_DUP ..... << OP_CHECKSIG` (also applies to the other three functions).,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17220#discussion_r337804740,337804740,src/test/compress_tests.cpp
adamjonas,2019-10-23 15:14:34,wouldn't assigning the script on the declaration remove the opportunity to call `.clear()` on it?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17220#discussion_r338111701,338111701,src/test/compress_tests.cpp
