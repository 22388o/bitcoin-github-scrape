michaelfolkson,2020-06-09 20:41:37,Concept NACK. If there was consensus amongst existing black contributors in the ecosystem that they found this offensive I would reconsider. I think they would say they have better things to do than wasting their time on quibbling about terms that avoid colors (whitelist/blacklist). Perusing other projects there are black devs choosing to use whitelist/blacklist terminology.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19227#issuecomment-641557736,641557736,

JeremyRubin,2020-06-09 20:57:56,"There are also a few uses of the term whitelist, one of which I'm responsible for (hence chiming in), that exist as external APIs.\n\nI'm indifferent on this particular issue. I'm supportive of the underlying issue of avoiding uninclusive terms -- I just don't think that blacklist/whitelist bear the same connotations as terminology like master/slave.

MarcoFalke,2020-06-09 21:15:15,"ACK and thanks for the change.\n\nLooking at the 400 open pull requests, we are clearly lacking developers to review the code. Simply the possibility that one developer may directly or indirectly be offended/discriminated by code comments or symbol names is a risk that we can't afford to take.\nBitcoin Core is an international project and if there are two similar English words, we should always",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19227#issuecomment-641583526,641583526,

luke-jr,2020-06-11 21:28:27,"Concept ACK\n\nBlacklist/whitelist have never been race-related, so that's a distraction.
