Simply the possibility that one developer may directly or indirectly be offended/discriminated by code comments or symbol names is a risk that we can't afford to take.\r\nBitcoin Core is an international project and if there are two similar English words, we should always pick the word that is most likely understood by the majority of international English speakers. Code should be self-documenting and variable names should be self-explanatory.\r\n\r\nThis is a refactoring change in the tests to change the name of a variable, so it allows for infinite bike-shedding. There is no way this could break any functionality, so with the existing ACKs, this is ready to go in. Leaving this open any longer will in the long term only attract heated off-topic discussions, wasting our reviewers' time.\r\n",

    "body": "If that is the case @luke-jr I would say blocklist is just as confusing. Blocked from what? Using the Bitcoin network? The fact that we have block(chain)s makes blocklist probably more confusing. \r\n\r\nThis has the potential to waste so much time. I note no one brought up in the Lightning dev [mailing list](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2020-June/002735.html) that the use of the term \"blackmail\" isn't appropriate. We can't control what GitHub or other corporations do but we can control what is considered appropriate on this project and in this community. I really hope we can take a more sane and logical approach based on consensus rather than this jumpy \"let's change it in case one person in the entire world finds this offensive.\"\r\n\r\n",
