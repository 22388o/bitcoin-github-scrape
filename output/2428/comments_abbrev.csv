Diapolo,2013-04-02T05:53:05Z,"ACK\n\n@laanwj If you get this in today, I'll create another translations update for this. Also, I remember I asked about a better general translations process in line with release cycles and whether we should drop languages, that are below a certain percentage translated, what do you think?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2428#issuecomment-15756007,15756007,
laanwj,2013-04-02T12:41:21Z,"@Diapolo yes I agree. Is 'updating translations' something that could be made part of the release process in doc/release-process.txt? I suppose so?\n\nWith regard to dropping translations, I don't know. I suppose below a certain % you could just as well have no translation. Do you know how other projects using transfex handle this, and if so what threshold they use?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2428#issuecomment-15772630,15772630,

burger2,2013-03-29T22:29:10Z,I agree with Diapolo with Address Book it's a keeper!\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2428#discussion_r3592540,3592540,src/qt/bitcoingui.cpp
laanwj,2013-03-30T06:11:37Z,"Agree with Diapolo. ""Coins"" is indeed unnecessary and ACK on removing it.\n\n""Contacts"" doesn't really make sense to me for financial sw. What it really is, is a list of past (or stored for future usage) recipient addresses. So ""address book"" is a pretty nice analogy. Then again there may be wisdom in completely moving it to the background as it encourages re-use, see also @gmaxwell's point in #24",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2428#discussion_r3594150,3594150,src/qt/bitcoingui.cpp
