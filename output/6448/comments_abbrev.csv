petertodd,2015-07-17T11:19:41Z,"The refactoring is reasonable. However without expiration of low fee transactions it's a pretty dangerous change, as the moment you fill up the mempool with junk that miners don't or can't mine your node stops relaying transactions - better to have nodes crash with OOM errors and get restarted than that.\n\nThe simplest thing to do is for the purpose of the pull-req, disable the limit by setting i",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6448#issuecomment-122249625,122249625,

Another possibility it's to just start with #6416, which would already be a step in the right direction for conflict replacement policies (ie FS, RBF, zeroconf-safe-RBF, etc).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6448#issuecomment-122416186,122416186,
jtimon,2015-07-17T21:09:41Z,"Even if the default would be ridiculously high, at least we would be giving the option of the cap for people who really don't want their node to crash (maybe they prefer to restart it periodically to cleanup the mempool or something).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6448#issuecomment-122417466,122417466,

This is indicated in the commit message. The second commit is also a subset of that commit.
