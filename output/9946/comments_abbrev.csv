pinheadmz,2017-03-08T19:50:06Z,Ah yeah some of the tests in the list include --arguments in a string with the command. I wonder why it only failed on Travis builds with python3-zmq? I added two lines that separate the --arguments into list elements so hopefully `subprocess.Popen()` likes that better on those builds.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9946#issuecomment-285148775,285148775,

jnewbery,2017-03-24T18:48:58Z,"Sorry I'm late to this party. @theuni asked me to take a look at this.\n\nI really don't like the approach of changing the list of tests into a list of lists. It's torturing the test_runner code for the sake of a couple of test cases which take arguments. It's also borked the formatting of the printout report (look at how `max_len_name` gets set to see how).\n\nI think it's much better (and le",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9946#issuecomment-289112477,289112477,

I'll happily review this once you've pushed the new commit.\n\nRegarding the timeouts: the first thing I'd check is whether there are any bitcoin processes running. Sometimes the framework fails to clean up old processes if the test fails, which can lead to issues next time you run a test. If that's not the issue, I've beefed up the test logs recently.
