    "body": "@fanquake I looked around a bit for APIs we should be using, rather than disabling the functionality completely. I assumed that there would be some calls we could make before/after initiating some network activity (not that it would be useful for us, probably, given the nature of p2p), but I was disappointed in the documentation.\n\nBasically, I would like to know how a network-heavy application _should_ work with AppNap without disabling it, if only for my own edification. Have you stumbled onto anything along those lines?\n",
