practicalswift,2019-01-14T15:13:17Z,"Concept ACK, but please print the version only when `shellcheck` had something to say by adding:\n\n```\nif [[ $? != 0 ]]; then\n    echo\n    shellcheck --version\nfi\n```\n\nIMO checks should be silent unless deviations are found. That improves the signal to noise in the output when running multiple checks. \n\nThe tweak @laanwj is suggestion can be done in a follow-up PR.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15164#issuecomment-454038823,454038823,
