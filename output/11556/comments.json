But (as mentioned above), the only thing the GUI currently lets you do with the rbf checkbox is to bump the transaction fee later on. So the idea of this PR is to help the user make the connection between the rbf checkbox and the bumpfee command. \r\n\r\nIf it's likely that more rbf functionality gets added to the GUI in the forseeable future, I'd say a relatively generic label (like \"mark as replaceable\", \"mark as final\") would be best, but for now I'd mention fees either way, since it's the only visible effect the checkbox currently has (i.e enables bumpfee, and gives you a lower estimate)  ",

    "body": "@promag I don't think unexperienced users think that way. They already assume a transaction is final, because that's what they're used to from the legacy fiat world. Only when they send a transaction and find out it's stuck, they start looking for ways to fix that acute problem.\r\n\r\nThe way I see it (subjective of course) is that bumping fees is a feature, while the fact that this feature uses RBF is an implementation detail. If in the future we discover a different way to bump fees without RBF, the button could stay the same.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to understand your NACK though (as opposed to just a preference). Do you believe something would break? Are you worried that users won't tick the box if it doesn't show the full range of potential uses? Or that it's unmaintainable (to me it seems trivial to change this again later).\r\n\r\nIt sounds like it's worth trying to flip the default first; if that PR doesn't raise objections then we can just close this one. If it does, we can continue the discussion.",
