Although the verification must pass to ensure the security\n+  of the system, no other result from this verification is needed: If the node\n+  knew the history of a given block were valid it could skip checking scripts\n+  for its ancestors.\n+\n+- A new configuration option 'assumevalid' is provided to express this knowledge\n+  to the software.  Unlike the 'checkpoints' in the past this setting does not\n+  force the use of a particular chain: chains that are consistent with it are\n+  processed quicker, but other chains are still accepted if they'd otherwise\n+  be chosen as best. Also unlike 'checkpoints' the user can configure which\n+  block history is assumed true, this means that even outdated software can\n+  sync more quickly if the setting is updated by the user.\n+\n+- Because the validity of a chain history is a simple objective fact it is much\n+  easier to review this setting.  As a result the software ships with a default\n+  value adjusted to match the current chain shortly before release.  The use\n+  of this default value can be disabled by setting -assumevalid=0\n+\n+Fundrawtransaction change address reuse\n+----------------------------------------\n+\n+- Before 0.14, `fundrawtransaction` was by default wallet stateless. In\n+  almost all cases `fundrawtransaction` does add a change-output to the\n+  outputs of the funded transaction. Before 0.14, the used keypool key was\n+  never marked as change-address key and directly returned to the keypool\n+  (leading to address reuse).  Before 0.14, calling `getnewaddress`\n+  directly after `fundrawtransaction` did generate the same address as\n+  the change-output address.\n+\n+- Since 0.14, fundrawtransaction does reserve the change-output-key from\n+  the keypool by default (optional by setting  `reserveChangeKey`, default =\n+  `true`)\n+\n+- Users should also consider using `getrawchangeaddress()` in conjunction\n+  with `fundrawtransaction`'s `changeAddress` option.\n+\n 0.14.0 Change log\n =================\n "
