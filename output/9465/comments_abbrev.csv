laanwj,2017-01-05T10:00:09Z,A nice by-product of this change is that the signing is factored out. Which means that at some point this huge function could be split into multiple clearly defined functions.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9465#discussion_r94740699,94740699,src/wallet/wallet.cpp
sipa,2017-01-05T15:20:54Z,"This is a bit confusing to me. We're not elimining the dummy signatures in order to do fee calculation, but removing the dummy signatures which were added in order to do fee calculation.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9465#discussion_r94785977,94785977,src/wallet/wallet.cpp
