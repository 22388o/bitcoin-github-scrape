laanwj,2012-04-13T13:47:36Z,Can you point to the documentation on that? It sounds unlikely; TS files are supposed to be generated automatically from the source code.\n(And plural forms differ per language. They cannot be sourced practically from English)\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1089#issuecomment-5114817,5114817,
Diapolo,2012-04-13T13:59:39Z,"Look at the other plurals or numerusform tags in the en .ts file. I'm sure someone placed the translations for the existing numerusform tags in there.\n\nIt seems this can be done with Qt Linguist application (open the en .ts and search for %n second(s) ago in BitcoinGUI), as the existing translations where plural forms are used are displayed with a yellow question mark and the english translation",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1089#issuecomment-5115046,5115046,
Diapolo,2012-04-13T14:04:24Z,"It seems Qt Linguist is the tool of choice :) ... you can even say that a translation is finished, which marks the string with a green check + removes the type=""unfinished"" tag for finished translations (that's for english master file - translation here means you looked through, added plural forms and marked strings as finished), cool!\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1089#issuecomment-5115153,5115153,
