laanwj,2020-11-22 10:10:38,"In #20434 (specifically for pixie  and symbol check / security check) I've used `mypy` with `--disallow-untyped-calls `. I tried `--disallow-untyped-defs` and `--disallow-incomplete-defs` as well but that was some more work. probably better to leave it for a later PR.\n\nBetter not to overlap work here. I'd prefer if this didn't collide with changes in #20434 (or maybe base it on that).\n\n> C",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20451#issuecomment-731725003,731725003,
