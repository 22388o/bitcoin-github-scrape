I generally think it's better to pass data explicitly where it needs to go than to sneak it through side channels or recompute it unnecessarily, and I don't see that much cost in adding function arguments. But I also agree with others in \r\nhttps://botbot.me/freenode/bitcoin-core-dev/msg/86999458/ who pointed out that there is *some* cost to adding function arguments, and that it would be nicer if hashes could be obtained more efficiently from CBlocks or from another block class.\r\n\r\n@jtimon, from my recollection of what people were saying two weeks ago, if this change actually did connect blocks \"~1.05x faster,\" that would be enough to overcome objections. The thought was more that hashing a block is so much simpler than connecting a block, that you would not actually see any measurable increase in runtime performance from this change.",
