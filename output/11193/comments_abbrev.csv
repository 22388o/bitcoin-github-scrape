practicalswift,2017-08-30T07:54:22Z,"@jonasschnelli Yes, you're correct but the current `memset` method seems a bit overkill for the task at hand. Instead of prematurely setting 1025 bytes to zero my suggestion is to set only one byte to zero when needed :-)\n\nIn addition to being more efficient and less surprising, this has the added benefit of making some static analyzers happy - I've seen at least one static analyzer getting co",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11193#issuecomment-325912512,325912512,
