laanwj,2012-05-21T16:58:24Z,"Agree with moving HelpMessageBox to guiutil.h\n\nI'm not sure about the ""options"" naming though. We already have an options dialog. This will generate confusion.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1364#issuecomment-5827757,5827757,
Diapolo,2012-05-21T17:07:10Z,"I guess we should call the ""options"" in that case parameters as that describes, what they are.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1364#issuecomment-5828006,5828006,
laanwj,2012-05-21T17:11:35Z,Yes that's better\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1364#issuecomment-5828106,5828106,
Diapolo,2012-05-21T17:35:13Z,"Okay, updated to use the word ""parameters"" in this case.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1364#issuecomment-5828699,5828699,
laanwj,2012-05-21T17:44:53Z,"Uhm, you don't have to change it everywhere throughout the program. Just for the button... no need to make core changes for an UI improvement.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1364#issuecomment-5828932,5828932,
Diapolo,2012-05-21T17:59:01Z,"I believe it would be a bad idea to show ""options"" AND ""parameters"" for the same thing ... it IS a rename, but it makes sens. Just write ""Bitcoin paramaters"" on a label and when you click show you read ""options"" ... how missleading is this :)?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1364#issuecomment-5829268,5829268,
laanwj,2012-05-21T18:04:21Z,"Well maybe call it ""command-line options"" then. It already makes it distinct from the UI options.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1364#issuecomment-5829368,5829368,
Diapolo,2012-05-21T18:21:44Z,That's the best solution ... I need to revert some changes then ^^.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1364#issuecomment-5829789,5829789,
Diapolo,2012-05-21T20:46:22Z,"Updated and now just using ""command-line options"" in the label above the added button and instead ""options"" displayed in the header of the help message. No further changes were made.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1364#issuecomment-5833262,5833262,
Diapolo,2012-06-01T14:34:04Z,Rebased and ready to merge.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1364#issuecomment-6061766,6061766,
