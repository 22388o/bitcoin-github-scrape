jonasschnelli,2016-01-08T12:17:15Z,"Nice!\nutACK.\n\nBut this actually does not test the issue #7316, because the reported issue can only happen when you run bitcoin-qt with `-server=1`.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7320#issuecomment-169983434,169983434,

Indeed, this would catch #7316.\n\n> Are you still working on the BITCOIND=bitcoin-qt nightly rpc tests?\n\nIt's relatively far down on my priority list.

laanwj,2016-01-09T15:22:06Z,"Concept ACK, but setting a timeout of 1 and then waiting a second is too close. A slight mistiming (e.g. busy machine) would result in a race condition, what about waiting 2 seconds instead?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7320#discussion_r49264911,49264911,qa/rpc-tests/keypool.py
