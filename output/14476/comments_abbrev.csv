sipa,2018-10-17T07:49:59Z,I'm not convinced we need more pure utility functionality as RPCs. These things can be implemented as a library or whatever.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14476#issuecomment-430526327,430526327,

rodentrabies,2018-10-14T14:57:38Z,"Thanks for pointing that out. Some of the ways to resolve this:\n- function `Split` implemented in #13751 can be used in place of `boost::algorithm::split` introduced here as well, so it may be resolved by either amending to this commit, or to the one #13751, depending on what's first to get to `master`;\n- since this change is not that important for this PR, so I can just delete the last commit",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14476#discussion_r224995763,224995763,src/core_read.cpp
