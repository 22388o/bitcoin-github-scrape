luke-jr,2013-07-03T16:39:46Z,"If roundabout methods are good enough for getting the full data for a block (all the transactions), why not this too?\n\nAt the very least, it would seem to me to make better sense as an interface, to use getblockhash with negative indexes (eg, -1 = last block).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2812#issuecomment-20428527,20428527,
jgarzik,2013-07-03T16:41:50Z,"@luke-jr That is actually another todo item.  Getting an entire, raw block is difficult, potentially impossible without -txindex.  This is frustrating, because the data is certainly available to bitcoind.\n\nI've been planning a 'getrawblock <hash>' RPC pull request for this reason.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2812#issuecomment-20428647,20428647,
