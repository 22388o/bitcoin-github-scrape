jnewbery,2017-02-11T00:57:34Z,"@morcos has pointed out version 2 transactions were actually made standard in the CSV PR #7648 (not #7562 as I claimed above). That means that we were relaying version 2 transactions before CSV was activated. Oops.\n\nAnyway, the point still stands. BIP68 is now well and truly activated, so we don't need to test pre-activation standardness.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9739#issuecomment-279106454,279106454,

Oops.\n\nI think that is fine and that it was the intent-- so long as they were _valid_ CSV transactions, which they were, because the CSV rules were enforced against the mempool prior to activation.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9739#issuecomment-279512834,279512834,
jnewbery,2017-02-21T21:55:38Z,"ok, I've moved the standardness check to after BIP68 activation. I've also added a comment to say transaction version 2 is *always* standard for current bitcoin core versions to avoid any confusion for people reading the code. I've verified that the test still runs.\n\nOnce you're happy and have ACKed the changes, I'll squash for merging.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9739#issuecomment-281494238,281494238,

sdaftuar,2017-02-21T19:34:50Z,"I think we should move this to below the CSV activation.  Testing that relaying of nVersion=2 transactions post activation makes sense, whereas testing that it works pre-activation is strange -- it's okay in this case that we allow it (because on mainnet activation happened a long time ago), but that is not how the code used to behave prior to activation (because relaying those transactions prior ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9739#discussion_r102296873,102296873,qa/rpc-tests/bip68-sequence.py
