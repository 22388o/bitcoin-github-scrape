jonasschnelli,2015-11-09T07:58:50Z,Nice catch! I was also looking for the NULL pointer access... we need to be careful by always keeping in mind: `#ifdef ENABLE_WALLET != pwalletMain available`.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6970#issuecomment-154990796,154990796,

The code used to check for `ISMINE_*`, which can only be `ISMINE_NO` if there is no wallet, but that check was removed there.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6970#issuecomment-155031557,155031557,

jlopp,2015-11-09T23:20:42Z,"@laanwj Yes, I confirmed that my node no longer crashes after issuing the validateaddress command. As for the other errors I had posted in my comments, those were errors that the debugger was throwing immediately upon trying to run bitcoind, not upon calling validateaddress.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6970#issuecomment-155230592,155230592,
