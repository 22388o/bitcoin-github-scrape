Seems a bit silly to me to have two different prefix types sitting right next to each other, but if that's what we decide for some reason, then fine, but at least we'll have our justification and we won't have this debate aga",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7150#issuecomment-163019649,163019649,
MarcoFalke,2015-12-08T21:29:31Z,"> executive decision on what places in the code will use MB and what will use MiB\n\nAccording to #6981 we are using MB, kB etc. As 0.12 is not yet released everyone is welcome to change newly introduced MiB, kiB (like maxuploadtarget) to SI units.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7150#issuecomment-163023205,163023205,

laanwj,2015-12-10T11:30:25Z,"The preference is SI units everywhere, so MB, GB, kB which are powers of 1000. To deviate from that at least have a good reason (not ""I like powers of two better"").\n\nWhich power of 1000 should be used depends on the quantity in question. For reporting of memory sizes, I think usually kB is the best choice not MB, as to be able to see small changes. Disk sizes should be MB or GB.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7150#issuecomment-163584522,163584522,
morcos,2015-12-10T16:16:36Z,Then i suggest we use kB for both mempool and cache size in this line regardless of the fact that the cache size is powers of 2 other places..   we can fix that later if needed...   lets move towards consistency\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7150#issuecomment-163674502,163674502,
