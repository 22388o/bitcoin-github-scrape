Xekyo,2021-04-26 11:54:14,"I think this may be slightly more clear:\n```suggestion\n    /** Maximum number of unconfirmed ancestors aggregated across all UTXOs in an OutputGroup. */\n```",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21759#discussion_r620225230,620225230,src/wallet/coinselection.h

Xekyo,2021-04-26 12:06:18,"Since this is a patch to master, I think `use_bnb` still means ""only use BnB"". The try BnB first and then fall back to knapsack behavior gets introduced by #17331.\n```suggestion\n    /** Toggles use of the Branch and Bound coin selection algorithm instead of the knapsack solver. */\n```",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21759#discussion_r620232979,620232979,src/wallet/wallet.h
Xekyo,2021-04-26 12:17:51,"Mh, this one is a bit more subtle. How about:\n```suggestion\n    /** The feerate used to estimate an upper bound on what should be sufficient to spend the change output some time in the future. */",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21759#discussion_r620240972,620240972,src/wallet/wallet.h

Xekyo,2021-04-26 12:34:39,"""at a target value and feerate"" sounds a bit odd to me. Maybe:\n```suggestion\n    // Coin Selection attempts to select inputs from a pool of eligible UTXOs to fund the\n    // transaction at a target feerate. If an attempt fails, more attempts may be made\n    // using a more permissive CoinEligibilityFilter.\n```",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21759#discussion_r620253129,620253129,src/wallet/wallet.cpp
