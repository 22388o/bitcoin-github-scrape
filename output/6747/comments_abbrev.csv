TheBlueMatt,2015-10-02T09:33:24Z,"Long-term isnt the goal to just switch enforcement of most softforks to blockheight/timestamp and then use versionbits globally? (I believe most things were rolled out via a IsSuperMajority-like system, and then the code was just simplified later by replacing the checks with what-the-switchover-date-was checks).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6747#issuecomment-144974836,144974836,
