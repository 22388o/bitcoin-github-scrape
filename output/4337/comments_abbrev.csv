sipa,2014-06-13T20:04:30Z,"No objection to the patch as it makes the code more obviously correct, but DecodeBase58 never touches its vch reference in case it returns false, which for the DecodeBase58Check call in SetString means that vchTemp will always be empty in the case it fails. Or in other words, the (vchTemp.size() < nVersionBytes) check will always trigger if SetString's call to DecodeBase58Check fails.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4337#issuecomment-46054198,46054198,

jgarzik,2014-06-13T20:49:40Z,"Necessary?  No.  But IMO it makes things slightly more readable, while producing the same compiler-optimized end result as alternatives.  The compiler generates a temporary for the direct result of each function/method call, in any case.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4337#discussion_r13771035,13771035,src/base58.cpp

Of course the || evaluation order makes sure that this is correct, but I prefer logical conditions that don't depend on the order, and thus don't break when they are rearranged.\n(so TL;DR I'm ok with the way it is now)\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4337#discussion_r13779137,13779137,src/base58.cpp
