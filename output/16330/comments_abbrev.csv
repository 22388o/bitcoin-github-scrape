hebasto,2019-07-02 20:34:25,Is it ok if the `gpg` example output does not match the real one? I mean that `gpg` actually prints `expires: ` string.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16330#discussion_r299672757,299672757,contrib/verifybinaries/README.md
MarcoFalke,2019-07-02 20:41:24,"Alternatively you can change the text to something like:\n\n`gpg --fingerprint ""01EA 5486 DE18 A882 D4C2  6845 90C8 019E 36C2 E964""` should return a key and not an error.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16330#discussion_r299675269,299675269,contrib/verifybinaries/README.md

There's already too many things that need to be updated after an expiration date bump (and apparently we're **still** finding new things! good catch).",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16330#discussion_r299850052,299850052,contrib/verifybinaries/README.md

MarcoFalke,2019-07-03 11:55:35,"The only reason I added the gpg output here, is to have the fingerprint written down in our doc. The reason was not to have some gpg output here that is supposed to be constantly updated whenever a date or version changes.
