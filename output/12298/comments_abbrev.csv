promag,2018-02-05T20:41:17Z,Do you think starting the loop from a random index helps?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12298#issuecomment-363214607,363214607,
sipa,2018-02-05T20:50:22Z,@ryanofsky @promag I don't think there is any reason to aim for constant time here. Someone who can observe code branches taken can presumably already derive which coins are yours. Trying to avoid that is nearly impossible (and certainly not feasible without a complete redesign).,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12298#issuecomment-363216996,363216996,
