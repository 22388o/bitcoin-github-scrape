MarcoFalke,2018-07-18T23:11:44Z,Could you please also fix this in `contrib/README.md` and https://github.com/bitcoin-core/docs/blob/master/gitian-building.md#initial-gitian-setup,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13706#discussion_r203559422,203559422,doc/release-process.md
MitchellCash,2018-07-18T23:29:19Z,@MarcoFalke sure can,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13706#discussion_r203562442,203562442,doc/release-process.md
MitchellCash,2018-07-18T23:42:04Z,@MarcoFalke both now done,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13706#discussion_r203564662,203564662,doc/release-process.md
fanquake,2018-07-19T05:08:48Z,nit: Could pass `--ignore-case` to sort,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13706#discussion_r203602964,203602964,doc/release-process.md
MitchellCash,2018-07-19T06:06:33Z,"@fanquake right!\n\nInterestingly I was using the `sort` utility on Ubuntu 16.04 and it strangely ignores case by default, so I didn't spot this issue. However, I just tested this on my Mac using both `sort` and `gsort` and it definitely requires this flag.\n\nI have now updated the commit with the changes.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13706#discussion_r203610537,203610537,doc/release-process.md
laanwj,2018-07-20T13:35:28Z,"FWIW the script that I actually use is:\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n# Create authors list for changelog\n# Example: list_authors.sh v0.9.0rc2..0.9.0\nexport LC_ALL=C\ngit log --use-mailmap --format='%aN' ""$*"" | sort -uif | sed -e 's/^/- /'\n```\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13706#discussion_r204045801,204045801,doc/release-process.md
MitchellCash,2018-07-21T10:51:46Z,"Would you rather I turn this into a script, like you posted, within the ‘devtools’ directory? Being essentially a single line command I didn’t think it worth it, but happy to do so if there’s consensus.

fanquake,2018-07-23T07:26:31Z,"@mitchellcash I don't think that's required. You could just add `--use-mailmap` to your example, then this should be fine to merge.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13706#discussion_r204302722,204302722,doc/release-process.md
MitchellCash,2018-07-25T03:53:43Z,@fanquake because there is no shared `mailmap` file in the repo is that actually required?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13706#discussion_r204974463,204974463,doc/release-process.md
fanquake,2018-07-25T11:08:25Z,"@mitchellcash Fair enough, as this is only an example anyways, lets just leave it as is.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13706#discussion_r205068373,205068373,doc/release-process.md
