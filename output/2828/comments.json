    "body": "Two comments:\n- Shared locks are not recursive, so if any of these wallet callbacks causes a call to main, which causes a new callback, you have a deadlock. I don't believe such cases occur, but it's worth making a comment about it in the code.\n- There is still a potential deadlock when callbacks are combined with modifications to setpwalletRegistered. This is not a problem for now, as such modifications only happen at startup, but we need to think about this before fully-fledged multiwallet is added. In general, it will probably mean that RPC calls cannot gratuitously lock the wallet anymore - only those that need access to a wallet, and only the one the need. In particular, anything modifying the set of registered wallets will need a lock on setpwalletRegistered without locking any of the wallets in it.\n\nACK though.\n",

It chanages paths in makefile.linux-mingw or otherwise changes build scripts in a way that made them incompatible with the automated testing scripts (please tweak those patches in contrib/test-scripts)\n2. It adds/modifies tests which test network rules (thanks for doing that), which conflicts with a patch applied at test time\n3. It does not build on either Linux i386 or Win32 (via MinGW cross compile)\n4. The test suite fails on either Linux i386 or Win32\n5. The block test-cases failed (lookup the first bNN identifier which failed in https://github.com/TheBlueMatt/test-scripts/blob/master/FullBlockTestGenerator.java)\n\nIf you believe this to be in error, please ping BlueMatt on freenode or TheBlueMatt here.\n\nThis test script verifies pulls every time they are updated. It, however, dies sometimes and fails to test properly.  If you are waiting on a test, please check timestamps to verify that the test.log is moving at http://jenkins.bluematt.me/pull-tester/current/\nContact BlueMatt on freenode if something looks broken.\n",
