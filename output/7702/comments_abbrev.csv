MarcoFalke,2016-03-17T10:29:26Z,@jonasschnelli I fail to see why you added this noop. I guess you used it for debugging and it is save to remove.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7702#discussion_r56483419,56483419,qa/rpc-tests/mempool_limit.py
jonasschnelli,2016-03-17T12:14:53Z,Yes. I guess this can be removed. Should be locked by L39 anyways.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7702#discussion_r56494238,56494238,qa/rpc-tests/mempool_limit.py
MarcoFalke,2016-03-17T13:43:43Z,"`lockunspent(True)` will _un_lock, but signrawtransaction does not add any lock.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7702#discussion_r56504985,56504985,qa/rpc-tests/mempool_limit.py
