gmaxwell,2017-08-09T00:21:30Z,"Please avoid titling PR's with things like ""Fix memory leak"" for things where there isn't an actual leak in practice. (e.g. because it exits).  Changes like this are good but they mess up people trying to figure out if an issue they are encounter has been fixed (""I have a memory leak, oh they just fixed one. They's probably it.""), or when slowing things down when looking for other issues.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11007#issuecomment-321117470,321117470,
