    "body": "I'm very much in favor of encapsulating the actual logic for many RPC methods to where it belongs. However, that doesn't mean that the conversion to JSON should happen there.\n\nFor example, if CWallet and CWalletTx had a cleaner interface for requesting information, this could reduce duplication between RPC and GUI. However, that probably means something a thin layer in between of data structure to represent information extracted from and sent to the wallet. The GUI would inspect these structure and convert them to GUI elements, the RPC would inspent them and convert to JSON.\n",

My eventual goal for this is to make CWallet a fully-functional first-class object, hide CWalletDB entirely, and have the RPC methods talking strictly to the wallet object. In addition to the \"standard\" benefits of proper encapsulation, this will eventually allow the client to support, for example, multiple wallets.\n",
