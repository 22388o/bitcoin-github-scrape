    "body": "Ok @pstratem, removed fFromMe again. I don't have any opinion on whether it should be kept or removed. I just think it should be documented as in commit https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9351/commits/39c77b00e3d61dfea1f45be5d3b77e5adea7b91a if it is not removed.\r\n\r\nReasons I could imagine why someone might not want to remove it is that it provides a nice little clue about the origin of a transaction that could be useful for debugging, or to show as information in the UI. Also, removing the variable doesn't simplify the code very much. Another reason to keep it might be that having it could make it easier to remove the `fTimeReceivedIsTxTime` variable which I think is actually a stranger thing to serialize. It has similar meaning to `fFromMe`, but unlike fFromMe is not merged properly in `AddToWallet`.",
