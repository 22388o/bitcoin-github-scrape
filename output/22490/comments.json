    "body": "@mzumsande- did you consider the approach of adding `-connect=0` as a command line arg in the TestNode initializer ([aka around here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/da1c0c64fd094880712d1c4167ad9eb3bb6ffcc6/test/functional/test_framework/test_node.py#L97))?\r\n\r\nI'm thinking something like\r\n```\r\n        if not any(\"-connect\" in s for s in self.extra_args):\r\n            self.args.append(\"-connect=0\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen looking at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22098#issuecomment-889842332, I realized that test doesn't actually need rebase or an exception added, because passing in something like `self.start_node(0, [\"-connect=fakenodeaddr\"])` from the individual test appends the `-connect` arg as a command-line argument, which overrules what's been set in the .conf file. \r\n\r\nSo this means the tests setting `self.disable_autoconnect` would sometimes be unnecessary?\r\n\r\nI think my proposed alternative could simplify the test framework code (don't have to pass around the `disable_autoconnect` param), and reduce overhead when implementing an individual test (don't have to set an additional field, can just pass `-connect=whatever`). But I didn't fully hash this out, so I easily could be missing something. \r\n\r\nWhat do you think? ",

The DNS seeding can be enabled using `-dnsseed`, but if we pass `-connect=anything`, `ThreadOpenConnections` skips using addrman. darn.  \r\n\r\nso setting as a command line arg instead of in the conf file is still an option, but we'd need an additional field regardless. still could be nice to have more straightforward logs (instead of having two `-connect=x`, we'd just have one), but the benefit is definitely reduced compared to what I was thinking.",
