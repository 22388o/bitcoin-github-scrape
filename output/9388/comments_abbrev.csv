laanwj,2016-12-21T08:01:40Z,"> Fields with variable units are a real pain to parse from scripts.\n\nI know it's being done because of lack of a better interface to get various information in machine readable format, but arguably debug logs should not be considered an interface to other software, but are for troubleshooting by operators.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9388#issuecomment-268460164,268460164,
rebroad,2016-12-21T17:22:39Z,@gmaxwell I'd be surprised if anyone is parsing nRequestTime from the askfor lines of a debug.log,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9388#issuecomment-268581695,268581695,
gmaxwell,2016-12-23T18:22:35Z,"@rebroad I absolutely have.  Let me put it another way:  What possibly useful thing is anyone going to do with that data _except_ parse it out and chart it to observe the behavior?\n\nIf it's your belief that people are actually not using it, then it should be removed, not pretty printed to a variable unit that is a real pain to create summary information from.\n\nAny consistent unit is fine--",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9388#issuecomment-269027929,269027929,
rebroad,2016-12-25T05:53:02Z,"@gmaxwell If you've used it to parse from then that is reason enough to leave it in, IMHO. Although given that there will be some who want human readable data and some who want machine readable data, then perhaps a command line option is called for (like the -h option on the du, df, ls, etc. commands)",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9388#issuecomment-269111276,269111276,
laanwj,2016-12-26T09:30:34Z,No way we're going to introduce a command line option for an obscure bit of\nlogging information.\n\nWhat I would like is a more general framework for machine-readable\nstatistics logging (like statoshi) that will log more and more useful\ninformation for producing timing summaries etc using external scripts.\n\nInformation such as this could then either be human-formatted or removed in\nthe debug,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9388#issuecomment-269190625,269190625,
