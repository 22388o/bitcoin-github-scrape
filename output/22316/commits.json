Onion\n   services created automatically (as in section 2) always have only one port\n   open.\n+\n+- In some regions of the world the Tor network is monitored or blocked.\n+  If you are in an environment that does not permit direct Tor connections or the use\n+  of Tor bridges, then considering the trade-offs, it may not be safe to use Tor.\n+\n+- For maximum privacy, it is preferable to disable accepting incoming connections.\n+\n+- Users can download packages with [torsocks](https://gitlab.torproject.org/legacy/trac/-/wikis/doc/torsocks)\n+  for better security and privacy.\n+\n+- Trade-offs involved in using `onlynet=onion`:\n+\n+  The `onlynet=onion` configuration option can potentially ensure the node attempts to only\n+  connect over Tor. It is more private when you combine it with no reachable IPv4/IPv6 address,\n+  in particular if you want to broadcast transactions without them being correlatable with your IP.\n+\n+  **Sybil Attacks**\n+\n+  On the other hand, if you only make random Tor connections, you're much more vulnerable to Sybil attacks.\n+  As Tor addresses may be created at no cost, an attacker can potentially flood the network with many Tor\n+  nodes and receive all of the outbound Tor connections an `onlynet=onion` node makes.\n+\n+  This is significantly less a concern if you make `-addnode` connections to trusted peers\n+  (even if they're onion addresses). It's also alleviated with IPv4/IPv6 (especially when using the -asmap\n+  configuration option) due to the cost of obtaining IPs in many networks.\n+\n+  If all of your connections are controlled by a Sybil attacker, they can easily prevent you from seeing confirmed\n+  transactions and, with more difficulty, even trick your node into falsely reporting a transaction as confirmed\n+  on the blockchain with most cumulative \u201cchainwork\u201d.\n+\n+  **Network Partitioning**\n+\n+  If too many nodes use `onlynet=onion`, it could become difficult for onion nodes to communicate with clearnet nodes,\n+  preventing the Tor network from seeing recent transactions and blocks. It is essential that some nodes access both\n+  clearnet and Tor, or use [`onlynet=i2p`](i2p.md) with `onlynet=onion`.\n+\n+- Deleting _onion_v3_private_key_ too frequently is not a best practice and should be avoided."
