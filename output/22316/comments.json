Earlier PR had a bigger scope with title as \"Improve Tor docs\", was difficult to add every suggestion and made no sense in keeping basic doc improvements pending for months.\r\n3. Few reviewers had issues with the \"examples\" part and \"DNS requests\" thing in previous PR. Keeping things separate and specific to one type of changes in a PR should help.\r\n4. Lot of comments in previous PR. It's difficult for anyone trying to review and read all the conversation however I don't want the contribution by everyone in the previous PR to be wasted so proposing a better alternative with changes in separate PRs.",

Create a pull request with basic things that can be added, discuss with PR reviewers and help more users know about it in a better way.\r\n\r\nI think 2 works better.\r\n\r\nExample: Deleting `onion_private_key` is mentioned on multiple websites: Bitcoin Wiki, Bisq Wiki etc. Editing every wiki, commenting on each social media post, etc. will take lot of time and people will still believe what they read in docs and not me.\r\n\r\n> Should there be privacy recommendations in each doc, or rather in one place (doc/privacy.md?) that interrelates between the networks.\r\n\r\nI think i2p and Tor have few similarities and differences.
