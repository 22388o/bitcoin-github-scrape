During the mid-July stress tests I had several reports of people placing transactions in accordance with fees returned by the estimation algo and waiting much longer than the expected number of blocks.   This patch is not going to completely solve the problem that the current fee estimation logic can only provide a rough answer of what has happened historically, but its actually ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6618#issuecomment-140562367,140562367,

morcos,2015-09-21T17:41:46Z,"@dcousens This is the kind of data analysis I've looked at.  Here's some data showing fee estimates in early July when one of the spam attacks started.  The green line represents a much more recent history of transaction confirmation times (half-life of 36 blocks or so).  You can see from the green line that once the attack starts around block 364130, you pretty immediately need a significantly hi",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6618#issuecomment-142055323,142055323,

morcos,2015-09-22T13:26:50Z,"@dcousens Correct on the axes. It's not surprising that the estimate can be higher even in the ""steady state"".  It's answering a slightly different question.  It may be that at block 364050 about 86% of transactions of feerate around 14K are being confirmed within 2 blocks.  Passes the old test and not the new.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6618#issuecomment-142289242,142289242,
