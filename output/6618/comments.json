During the mid-July stress tests I had several reports of people placing transactions in accordance with fees returned by the estimation algo and waiting much longer than the expected number of blocks.   This patch is not going to completely solve the problem that the current fee estimation logic can only provide a rough answer of what has happened historically, but its actually a very simple change and is worth it for the improvement.  Better logic is waiting for a sorted mempool (and ideas about what to do with it).\n",

    "body": "@dcousens This is the kind of data analysis I've looked at.  Here's some data showing fee estimates in early July when one of the spam attacks started.  The green line represents a much more recent history of transaction confirmation times (half-life of 36 blocks or so).  You can see from the green line that once the attack starts around block 364130, you pretty immediately need a significantly higher fee to be confirmed within 5 blocks.  However the old fee estimates don't really start increasing for about 50 blocks.  The new fee estimates react much quicker.  This is because if, historically, close to 100% of your transactions were being confirmed within the target, even if the number all of a sudden becomes 0%, it can take some time for the moving history to drop below 85% over the time horizon we use.  Dropping below 95% happens much more quickly.  I experimented with using a shorter time horizon but there was a lot of noise in the data.  In the absence of this effect, I think its kind of an arbitrary choice as to what percentage of recent transactions should have been confirmed within the target number of blocks is the right answer to the fee estimate question.\n![fee estimation changes](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4360349/9999778/41351c24-6066-11e5-8f83-e02ec12618a3.jpg)\n",
