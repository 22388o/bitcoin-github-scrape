This can be used to cross-compile Bitcoin directly on Windows without the need for a separate Linux VM or Server.  The instructions included in this commit explain how to configure the environment and build Bitcoin Core using this new feature.",

This is also used to build the release binaries.\n \n-Building on Windows itself is possible (for example using msys / mingw-w64),\n-but no one documented the steps to do this. If you are doing this, please contribute them.\n+While there are potentially a number of ways to build on Windows (for example using msys / mingw-w64),\n+using the Windows Subsystem For Linux is the most straight forward.  If you are building with\n+an alternative method, please contribute the instructions here for others who are running versions\n+of Windows that are not compatible with the Windows Subsystem for Linux.\n+\n+Compiling with the Windows Subsystem For Linux\n+-------------------\n+\n+With Windows 10, Microsoft has released a new feature named the\n+[Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://msdn.microsoft.com/commandline/wsl/about).  This feature allows you to run a bash shell directly on Windows in an Ubuntu based\n+environment.  Within this environment you can cross compile for Windows without the need for a separate Linux VM or Server.\n+\n+This feature is not supported in versions of Windows prior to Windows 10 or on Windows Server SKUs.\n+\n+To get the bash shell, you must first activate the feature in Windows.\n+\n+1. Turn on Developer Mode\n+  * Open Settings -> Update and Security -> For developers\n+  * Select the Developer Mode radio button\n+  * Restart if necessary\n+2. Enable the Windows Subsystem for Linux feature\n+  * From Start, search for \"Turn Windows features on or off\" (type 'turn')\n+  * Select Windows Subsystem for Linux (beta)\n+  * Click OK\n+  * Restart if necessary\n+3. Complete Installation\n+  * Open a cmd prompt and type \"bash\"\n+  * Accept the license\n+  * Create a new UNIX user account (this is a separate account from your Windows account)\n+\n+After the bash shell is active, you can follow the instructions below for Windows 64-bit Cross-compilation.\n+When building dependencies within the 'depends' folder, you may encounter an error building\n+the protobuf dependency.  If this occurs, re-run the command with sudo.  This is likely\n+a bug with the Windows Subsystem for Linux feature and may be fixed with a future update.\n \n Cross-compilation\n -------------------\n@@ -41,4 +73,3 @@ To build executables for Windows 64-bit:\n     make\n \n For further documentation on the depends system see [README.md](../depends/README.md) in the depends directory.\n-"
