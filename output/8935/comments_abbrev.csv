achow101,2016-10-17T04:39:09Z,Have you actually been able to build it this way? I have not. I think part of it is because the WSL is based upon Ubuntu 16.04 which has a version of mingw that breaks the cross compilation.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8935#issuecomment-254111157,254111157,
laanwj,2016-10-17T11:29:19Z,"Concept ACK, though I too think this should wait on https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/projects/1 to be completed. I strongly recommend against using 16.04 for cross-building windows for now.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8935#issuecomment-254182214,254182214,

Michagogo,2016-10-17T22:32:12Z,"I don't know much about WSL - what about the option of simply building ""Linux"" binaries ""natively"" in WSL, and running Bitcoin Core itself within WSL?

It'd be cool if we could get to the point of running Gitian on Windows sans VM...\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8935#issuecomment-254354110,254354110,
achow101,2016-10-17T22:41:35Z,You should be able to run bitcoind from within the WSL. However it doesn't support GUIs yet so bitcoin-qt will not work.\n\nI just tried running a gitian build from the WSL but it did not work for me.
