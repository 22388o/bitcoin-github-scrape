ajtowns,2021-02-01 22:00:23,"Probably should be a separate PR, but might be worth thinking about moving the `New outbound peer connected: ... (block-relay-only)` messages to a debug category too, at least for the transient connections? (And perhaps add a new `Replacing old outbound block-relay-only connection peer=X with peer=Y` for the rare case when the new connection isn't transient because you drop one of your original bl",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21041#issuecomment-771188550,771188550,

laanwj,2021-02-01 10:06:10,"I am not sure it makes sense to make a new debug category for this.\n\nBut if you do, I would prefer something conceptual like ""BLOCKSTORE"", flat file is an implementation detail and fairly irrelevant to users.\n\nAlso don't forget updating the table in `logging.cpp` so that it can actually be enabled :slightly_smiling_face: ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21041#discussion_r567699835,567699835,src/logging.h
