dcousens,2016-01-21T23:14:26Z,"@sipa does it?\n@morcos what is the motivation for this PR?  Is it a bug fix?  A performance improvement?\nIf the intentions are clear,  it may be able to make it for `0.13`.\n\nWe're only feature frozen right?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7056#issuecomment-173746004,173746004,
