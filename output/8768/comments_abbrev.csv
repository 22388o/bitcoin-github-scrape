laanwj,2016-09-20T15:35:25Z,I wonder why we don't have a constant DEFAULT_DISABLEWALLET like for the other args.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8768#discussion_r79640985,79640985,src/wallet/wallet.cpp
MarcoFalke,2016-09-20T15:39:40Z,Maybe some constants are too obvious to have a default value. In the future this might change for `-disablewallet` and we should introduce the default value.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8768#discussion_r79642071,79642071,src/wallet/wallet.cpp
laanwj,2016-09-21T08:55:23Z,But for consistency it'd make sense to have one. When changing the default it's easy enough to forget one of the GetArgs().\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8768#discussion_r79787584,79787584,src/wallet/wallet.cpp
