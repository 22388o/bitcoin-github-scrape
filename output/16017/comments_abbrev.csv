kristapsk,2019-05-13 15:03:25,"There are third party tutorials in the wild that mentions these settings, also it breaks things for already configured setups.

kristapsk,2019-05-13 15:15:46,"Ahh, didn't notice there was already deprecation warning. But it only goes to debug.log of `bitcoind`, which most of the users may not look at unless there are problems. They should at least be added to `bitcoin-cli` first too IMO.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16017#issuecomment-491865392,491865392,

gmaxwell,2019-05-13 19:21:39,"It is, but many people set the options 5+ years ago.  There has been no /active/ notification to those users.
