jnewbery,2020-06-10 15:34:58,"Concept NACK. This just seems to be moving code around for no good reason. base58 is very much linked to legacy P2PKH and P2SH addresses, so it makes sense that the code for those things should live in the same module (see segwit_address.py where the bech32 and segwit v0 address code are in the same module). The only thing that imports base58 for any other reason are the `bytes_to_wif()` and `gene",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19230#issuecomment-642088824,642088824,
