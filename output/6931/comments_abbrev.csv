gavinandresen,2015-11-03T17:11:37Z,"Concept ACK, but the logic seems more complicated than necessary.  Couldn't you just remove the BIP30 checking code entirely now that BIP34 has activated?  Why do the work in the old chain, when we know the old chain doesn't violate the rules (and have headers-first to prevent somebody from feeding us a low-work bogus chain)?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6931#issuecomment-153420913,153420913,

morcos,2015-11-03T17:42:19Z,@instagibbs I'm working on putting together some benchmarks.  There are a set of pulls that I've been working on to speed up ConnectBlock and CreateNewBlock.  I'll post an issue identifying them all and with some benchmarks.  But roughly speaking we're talking about these times on average over some recent data for CreateNewBlock (with 1GB dbcache and 1M sigcachesize)\n\n| Code version | time in ms,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6931#issuecomment-153429337,153429337,
