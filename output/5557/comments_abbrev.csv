zander,2015-01-03T10:59:49Z,"with ""backport"" I guess you mean cherry-pick. Maybe you want to look up the proper git way of doing it which is to commit on the oldest branch (0.10 in this case) and merge that into master on a regular basis.\nIf you ever want to do signing and/or cryptographic repository checks for tampering you can't use cherry-picks.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5557#issuecomment-68591037,68591037,
