rebroad,2012-05-17T22:05:43Z,"@jgarzik I would argue that had this mapping been named mapWaitingFor (as per #1341), this bug would have been less likely to have occurred, since upon renaming it becomes more intuitively obvious that it's in the wrong place in the code.\n\nI do think quite strongly that #1341 should be re-opened for some discusssion. If POLA isn't a good reason for a variable name change, then what is?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1347#issuecomment-5775415,5775415,

sipa,2012-05-20T19:55:50Z,"Not tested, but @rebroad's reasoning sounds correct to me. mapAlreadyAskedFor contains getdata requests that have not been answered yet. If AlreadyHave() returns true for an inv, there is no reason to keep waiting for it.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1347#issuecomment-5811712,5811712,
