    "body": "This is an alternative to #21603. That PR's motivation also applies to this PR:\r\n\r\n> A disk fill attack is an attack where an untrusted party (such as a peer) is able to cheaply make your node log to disk excessively. The excessive logging may fill your disk and thus make your node crash either cleanly (best case: if disk fill rate is relatively slow) or uncleanly (worst case: if disk fill rate is relatively fast).\r\n\r\nAn advantage I see with this approach is that it addresses the [concern](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21603#issuecomment-813901411) with log messages being dropped. With this approach, log messages are never dropped; they just don't go back an infinite amount of time :).\r\n\r\nAnother advantage that could prove very useful is that debug log categories can be enabled for an indefinite amount of time (#21603 sensibly does not limit debug logging). It's quite possible that a bug occurs rarely and at an unpredictable time. By the time the bug occurs, it's too late to enable the relevant debug log category. Also, it might be nice to not have to worry so much about adding more logging in general (without even having to condition it on a category). There may be useful stuff to log that we don't currently, because of this disk space concern.\r\n\r\nSome background information: Currently, `debug.log` grows unbounded until `bitcoind` restarts. During startup, if `debug.log` is greater than 11 MB, it's truncated to 10 MB (keeping only the most recent log messages). This PR will make this unnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe rotated log files are kept in a separate directory, to avoid cluttering up the data directory (see discussion below). This directory has the fixed name `debug-rotated` and is located in the same directory as the debug log file. That is, if you move the debug log file to a different location (using `-debuglogfile=path`), then `debug-rotated` also moves to the same directory as the debug log file. (This way they will be on the same file system, allowing renames.)\r\n\r\nAn easy way to manually test this without having to add artificial logging is to enable log rotation by adding these lines to `bitcoin.conf` (or specify on the command line):\r\n```\r\ndebuglogrotatekeep=10\r\ndebugloglimit=1\r\n```\r\nThen start `bitcoind -debug` (enable all debug categories), and observe the `debug.log` file and the rotated files:\r\n```\r\n$ cd .bitcoin\r\n$ ls -l debug.log\r\n-rw------- 1 larry larry     87513 Jun 27 09:11 debug.log\r\n$ ls -l debug-rotated\r\n-rw------- 1 larry larry   1000076 Jun 27 09:03 2021-06-27T15:03:56Z\r\n-rw------- 1 larry larry   1000190 Jun 27 09:05 2021-06-27T15:05:28Z\r\n-rw------- 1 larry larry   1000002 Jun 27 09:07 2021-06-27T15:07:09Z\r\n-rw------- 1 larry larry   1000042 Jun 27 09:07 2021-06-27T15:07:56Z\r\n-rw------- 1 larry larry   1000045 Jun 27 09:10 2021-06-27T15:10:55Z\r\n```\r\nThere's no harm in manually removing these rotated log files, even if `bitcoind` is running. So you could set up some kind of external agent that compresses the rotated files, or ships them off somewhere else, or whatever. (To prevent `bitcoind` from ever deleting rotated log files, set `debuglogrotatekeep=9999999` or something like that.)\r\n\r\nPlease comment or review: @jnewbery @practicalswift @dergoegge ",

    "body": "> Continuously dropping logs seems like an aggressive change to me because why drop the logs when there is no attack? I haven't had problems with logfile sizes in normal node operation. (maybe thats just me)\r\n\r\nI come from a storage system background, and dropping the oldest logs was standard practice. (This is why there's a `logrotate` facility on Unix and similar systems.) A general principle is that any demon process that can run for an arbitrary amount of time should not use resources in proportion to how long it's been running. Yes, resource usage can increase quickly early, and after reaching \"steady-state\" can go up and down over time. But the system shouldn't, for example, gradually use more memory or gradually require more CPU (requiring a restart to fix). The current logging design violates this principle as regards disk usage. So even without an active attack, we should be pruning the log file.\r\n\r\n> I think that the current behavior is actually quite useful because in case of an issue (e.g.: a crash) we have the entire log of the nodes lifespan.\r\n\r\nThat's true, but for reasons I already stated, that's not practical. The most useful information is likely to be in the most recent logs. The user can always increase the amount of logging (in effect, to infinity if needed). Or disable this feature (work as today). Consider another option the user has: Run some kind of small agent (even just a small shell script) that watches for new rotated debug log files, and copies them off to some other place with tons of storage. Or compresses them. Or filters out interesting stuff from them and deletes them.\r\n\r\n> This also seems to opens a similar attack vector as the global rate limiting did, an attacker (that knows of two bugs one of which is a disk filling bug) can execute an attack and then use the disk filling bug to rotate the logs out that had info about the attack.\r\n\r\nWell, this is unlikely-squared. This isn't something I'm worried about, but maybe I'm wrong.\r\n\r\nThanks for your comments!",

So I force-pushed a small change so that by default, there is no functional change (preserve existing behavior). If you want to enable log rotation, add lines like these to your `bitcoin.conf` file:\r\n```\r\ndebuglogrotatekeep=10\r\ndebugloglimit=1\r\n```\r\n(This will retain 10 rotated files, each around 1 MB.) Starting with `-debug` will generate a lot more logging.\r\n\r\nI think this version is much safer; if log rotation proves to be popular, we can consider making it default behavior later.",

    "body": "Strong Concept ACK\r\n\r\nI think one of the main reasons why restricting unlimited growth of the log file was never seen as particularly problematic in Bitcoin Core is the fact that running bitcoind with default parameters (that is, w/o pruning) already consumes (potentially) infinite disk space over time. Having a growth rate of > 1 GB per week of the block chain on mainnet, one would hardly be worried about the additional space consumption of relatively small log messages.\r\n\r\nThat said, I still fully agree that we should support log-rotating for the following reasons:\r\n* log file growth is less deterministic than block chain growth; there _could_ be a scenario that we are not aware of yet that leads to massive log ouputs, that an attacker could exploit\r\n* running pruned nodes will be more and more common in the future, and for those it makes even more sense to also limit the log-file size (I could imagine that users with very limited disk-space, running with `-prune=550` ran already into problems due to unexpected unlimited log file growth)\r\n* fulfilling the principle you mentioned: \r\n> [...] any demon process that can run for an arbitrary amount of time should not use resources in proportion to how long it's been running.\r\n\r\nI also think it's better to keep the default behaviour by now as it is. Maybe it's worth it mentioning in the docs that using this new feature is recommended for pruned node users?\r\n\r\nFeel free to tag me if this PR is out of draft, will be happy to review.",

    "body": "Thanks, @fanquake and @laanwj! Very good points.\r\n\r\n> ... separation of the GUI ...\r\n\r\nYou've given me an idea, tell me what you think of this (also @jnewbery and @theStack) as an alternative to this PR:\r\n\r\nI just did a proof-of-concept experiment on Linux (I don't know if this would work on Windows):\r\n```\r\n$ mknod /tmp/bitcoind-log p # p means named pipe, super-user (root) permissions are not needed\r\n$ cat /tmp/bitcoind-log     # this will just wait\r\n```\r\n_In another window_\r\n```\r\n$ bitcoind -shrinkdebugfile=0 -debuglogfile=/tmp/bitcoind-log\r\n```\r\nYou'll see the `debug.log` messages emanating from the `cat` command. Named pipes are cool. (When the writer, i.e. `bitcoind`, exits, `cat` gets an end-of-file and cleanly exits too.)\r\n\r\nProposal: What do you think about adding a Python script to `contrib` that's just a wrapper around `bitcoind` -- it would create the named pipe, start `bitcoind` (with passed-in arguments plus the `-shrinkdebugfile=0 -debuglogfile=/tmp/bitcoind-log` arguments), and then reads from the named pipe and writes to `debug.log`. It would be an alternate, entirely optional way to run the client.\r\n\r\nThis would reproduce the current functionality (except for shrinking `debug.log` at startup, but it could do that too).\r\n\r\nBut this python script could be enhanced to do log rotation -- and in the future, maybe other stuff like compression, filtering, sending some kind of alert or notification if certain log messages appear, who knows -- all without any changes to `bitcoind`.",

But if they forget (definitely need release notes on this), I _think_ it will be okay, because either this PR's log rotation will always happen (since it waits only until `debug.log` reaches 1 MB by default), or the `logrotate(8)` will happen (if the file size threshold is less than 1 MB). It would be confusing if both were happening! Maybe more thought is needed here.\r\n\r\nAn alternative might be to just remove this behavior (`SIGHUP` causing `debug.log` to be reopened), but then `logrotate(8)` will no longer work, and there may be existing users that are all set up to use `logrotate(8)`.",

    "body": "Thanks, @narula, that's still a good question. The idea of those defaults is that between 10 MB and 11 MB of log messages would be retained (just after a log rotation, 10 MB because there'd be 10 rotated files at 1 MB each plus an empty `debug.log`; just before log rotation, 10 MB for the same reason plus a 1 MB `debug.log`. This matches the current disk usage if `bitcoind` is restarted often (if not, then the `debug.log` size can increase without limit).\r\n\r\nIf the defaults were `DEFAULT_DEBUGLOGMB=10` and `DEFAULT_LOGROTATEKEEP=1` then the logging storage would vary from 10 MB (just after rotation) to 20 MB (just before rotation).\r\n\r\nOne could argue that the defaults could be quite a bit larger because the current default (10 MB minimum) was chosen when disks were smaller than they are typically today. But there could be that _one_ user whose disk is almost full, and upgrading to a release with this PR would soon run their disk out to space if the defaults were larger. (You might say that a node's disk space requirement  grows indefinitely anyway as more blocks are added to the blockchain, but that's not necessarily so because nodes can be configured with block pruning enabled.)",

The `-debuglogrotatekeep=n` configuration\n+  option specifies the number of rotated debug log files that are retained\n+  (default 0, log rotation disabled).

If you enable\n+  log file rotation and specify an\n+  alternate debug log file name using `-debuglogfile=path`, the last\n+  component of the path must be `debug.log`. (#22350)",

    "body": "Thanks so much for your comments; these are very useful.\r\n\r\n> ... rotation should work regardless of the filename ...\r\n\r\nI like your idea. After giving this more thought, perhaps the best approach is to let `-debuglogfile=path` to work as usual, but create a directory with a fixed name like `rotated-logs` (or `rotated-debug-logs`) and put all the _rotated_ log files within that directory. (The active debug log file, `debug.log` or as specified by `-debuglogfile`, would be as it is today, no change.) Because the rotated log files are in a directory with a specific purpose, they can have simple names like `2021-06-27T15:10:55Z.log`. They wouldn't have to be named according to the `-debuglogfile` argument.\r\n\r\nThis would have an added benefit: As I've been running this code to test it, my data directory now looks \"messy\" or polluted, with all these rotated log files that usually aren't very important -- why should they be so visible and prominent?\r\n```\r\n$ ls ~/.bitcoin\r\nbanlist.dat   debug-2021-06-27T21:19:42Z.log  fee_estimates.dat  signet\r\nbanlist.json  debug-2021-07-09T00:38:43Z.log  indexes            testnet3\r\nbitcoin.conf  debug-2021-07-14T16:32:30Z.log  mempool.dat        wallets\r\nbitcoind.pid  debug-2021-07-17T14:01:27Z.log  peers.dat          wallets-empty\r\nblocks        debug-2021-08-10T20:03:04Z.log  regtest\r\nchainstate    debug.log                       settings.json\r\n$\r\n```\r\n(And I've got only 5 rotated log files; there could be many more.) A small disadvantage is that it would be slightly more difficult to concatenate (or grep) all of the log files in time-order:\r\n```\r\n$ cat rotated-logs/* debug.log\r\n```\r\n(instead of just `cat debug*.log`) but that's not bad.\r\n\r\nSo unless there are objections, I'll make this change within the next few days.",

Beginning with this\n+  release, you can enable log file rotation. When the `debug.log` file\n+  reaches 1 MB, it's renamed to a name that includes the current date and\n+  time, such as `debug-2021-06-27T21:19:42Z.log` and `debug.log` is\n+  recreated as an empty file. Running `cat` or `grep` with an argument\n+  `debug*.log` accesses all debug log files, including the current one\n+  (`debug.log`) in time-order. The `-debuglogrotatekeep=n` configuration\n+  option specifies the number of rotated debug log files that are retained\n+  (default 0, log rotation disabled). The `-debugloglimit=n`\n+  configuration option specifies how large the `debug.log` file must\n+  become (in MB) before it is rotated (default is 10). If you enable\n+  log file rotation and specify an\n+  alternate debug log file name using `-debuglogfile=path`, the last\n+  component of the path must be `debug.log`. (#22350)",

    "body": "@josibake \r\n> i do think its important to throw an error when -daemon is used ...\r\n\r\nI looked into this more, and it's not trivial to fix. The problem is that bitcoind has already \"daemonized\" itself by the time it gets around to initializing the logging, which is later than when it tries to open the data directory. This problem happens without the current PR:\r\n```\r\n$ src/bitcoind -daemon -debuglogfile=some/non-existent/path\r\nBitcoin Core starting\r\n$ \r\n```\r\nand there's no indication that anything went wrong (the exit status is even 0, success). So I think this can be fixed in a separate PR.",
