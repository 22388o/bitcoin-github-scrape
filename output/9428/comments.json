    "body": "@rebroad Instead of opening two pull requests, that are alternatives to each other, could you instead open a single pull request, that contains your preferred changes, and mention the alternative change in the body of the PR. \r\n\r\nI could understand opening two separate pull requests if the two change-sets were extensive. ie both with many lines of vastly different code. However this is a similar one line change vs a two line change, so you could outline both approaches in a single PR.\r\n\r\nThere's also the problem of discussion around a similar issue becoming fragmented and/or lossed when it's spread across multiple pull requests discussing the same issue.\r\n\r\nApart from the above, we're also flooded with pull-requests at the moment, so while code changes/improvements are always welcome, opening multiple pull requests at a time over the same issues is unnecessarily adding to the backlog.\r\n\r\nI'm closing this, could you please add your changes/discussion from this PR into #9427. Thanks.",
