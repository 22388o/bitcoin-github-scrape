Additionally the implementation of `IsMine`\n+in Descriptor Wallets is far simpler than for Legacy Wallets.

Descriptor Wallets store\n+scriptPubKey information using descriptors. This is in contrast to the Legacy Wallet\n+structure where keys are used to generate scriptPubKeys and addresses. Because of this\n+shift to being script based instead of key based, many of the confusing things that legacy\n+wallets are not possible with Descriptor Wallets. Descriptor Wallets determine use a definition\n+of \"mine\" for scripts which is simpler and more intuitive than that used by Legacy Wallets.\n+Descriptor Wallets also uses different semantics for watch-only things and imports.\n+\n+As Descriptor Wallets are a new type of wallet, their introduction does not effect existing wallets.\n+Users who already have a Bitcoin Core wallet can continue to use it as they did before without\n+any change in behavior. Newly created Legacy Wallets (which is the default type of wallet) will\n+behave as they did in previous versions of Bitcoin Core.\n+\n+For users who decide to use Descriptor Wallets, the differences between them and Legacy Wallets\n+is largely limited to non user facing things. For most users, Descriptor Wallets will behave\n+similarly to Legacy Wallets except in import/export use cases and watchonly wallets.\n+\n+#### Creating Descriptor Wallets\n+\n+Descriptor Wallets are not created by default. They must be explicitly created using the\n+`createwallet` RPC or via the GUI. A `descriptors` option has been added to `createwallet`.\n+Setting `descriptors` to `true` will create a Descriptor Wallet instead of a Legacy Wallet.\n+\n+In the GUI, a checkbox has been added to the Create Wallet Dialog do indicate that a\n+Descriptor Wallet should be created.\n+\n+Without those options being set, a Legacy Wallet will be created instead. Additionaly the\n+Default Wallet created upon first startup of Bitcoin Core will be a Legacy Wallet.\n+\n+#### `IsMine` Semantics\n+\n+`IsMine` refers to the function used to determine whether a script belongs to the wallet.\n+This is then used to determine whether an output belongs to the wallet. Legacy Wallets\n+have a confusing definition of `IsMine` due to using keys. Keys can be involved in a variety\n+of different scripts and many of those scripts are considered part of the wallet. This results\n+in scripts being part of the wallet that the user is not necessarily aware of.\n+\n+With Descriptor Wallets, descriptors explicitly specify the set of scripts that are owned by\n+the wallet. Since descriptors are deterministic and easily enumerable, users will know exactly\n+what scripts the wallet will consider to belong to it. Additionally the implementation of `IsMine`\n+in Descriptor Wallets is far simpler than for Legacy Wallets. Notably, in Legacy Wallets, `IsMine`\n+allowed for users to take on type of address (e.g. P2PKH), mutate it into another address type\n+(e.g. P2WPKH), and the wallet would still detect outputs sending to the new address type\n+even without that address being requested from the wallet. Descriptor Wallets does not\n+allow for this and will only watch for the addresses that were explicitly requested from the wallet.\n+\n+These changes to `IsMine` will make it easier to reason about what scripts the wallet will\n+actually be watching for in outputs. However for the vast majority of users, this change is\n+largely transparent and will not have noticeable effect.\n+\n+#### Imports and Exports\n+\n+Descriptor Wallets handles imports differently from Legacy Wallets. In Legacy Wallets, imports\n+are treated separately from the keys generated by the wallet. This separation is part of the\n+watchonly behavior for Legacy Wallets and is also confusing, especially in combination with\n+the `IsMine` behavior. With Descriptor Wallets, only complete descriptors can be imported. These\n+descriptors are then just added to the wallet as if it were a descriptor generated by the wallet\n+itself. To avoid issues with existing import and export RPCs, these have been disabled. To import\n+into a Descriptor Wallet, a new `importdescriptors` RPC has been added that uses a syntax similar\n+to that of `importmulti`.\n+\n+Because Descriptor Wallets are storing different records and data from Legacy Wallets, existing\n+export RPCs are disabled for Descriptor Wallets. New export RPCs for Descriptor Wallets have\n+not yet been added.\n+\n+The following RPCs have been disabled for Descriptor Wallets:\n+\n+* importprivkey\n+* importpubkey\n+* importaddress\n+* importwallet\n+* dumpprivkey\n+* dumpwallet\n+* importmulti\n+* addmultisigaddress\n+* sethdseed\n+\n+#### Watchonly Wallets\n+\n+In Legacy Wallets, a wallet could contain both private keys and scripts that were being watched.\n+Those watched scripts would not contribute to your normal balance. In order to see the watchonly\n+balance and to use watchonly things in transactions, an `include_watchonly` option as added\n+to many RPCs that would allow users to do that. However this is confusing and easy to mess up.\n+\n+Descriptor Wallets move to a split watchonly model. Instead an entire wallet is considered to be\n+watchonly depending on whether it was created with private keys disabled. This eliminates the need\n+to distinguish between things that are watchonly and things that are not within a wallet itself.\n+\n+This change does have a caveat. If a Descriptor Wallet with private keys *enabled* and has\n+both single key (e.g. wpkh(...)) and multiple key descriptors (e.g. multi(...) with only one private",

Since descriptors are deterministic and easily enumerable, users will know exactly\n+what scripts the wallet will consider to belong to it. Additionally the implementation of `IsMine`\n+in Descriptor Wallets is far simpler than for Legacy Wallets. Notably, in Legacy Wallets, `IsMine`\n+allowed for users to take on type of address (e.g. P2PKH), mutate it into another address type\n+(e.g. P2WPKH), and the wallet would still detect outputs sending to the new address type\n+even without that address being requested from the wallet. Descriptor Wallets does not\n+allow for this and will only watch for the addresses that were explicitly requested from the wallet.\n+\n+These changes to `IsMine` will make it easier to reason about what scripts the wallet will\n+actually be watching for in outputs. However for the vast majority of users, this change is\n+largely transparent and will not have noticeable effect.\n+\n+#### Imports and Exports\n+\n+Descriptor Wallets handles imports differently from Legacy Wallets. In Legacy Wallets, imports\n+are treated separately from the keys generated by the wallet. This separation is part of the\n+watchonly behavior for Legacy Wallets and is also confusing, especially in combination with\n+the `IsMine` behavior. With Descriptor Wallets, only complete descriptors can be imported. These\n+descriptors are then just added to the wallet as if it were a descriptor generated by the wallet\n+itself. To avoid issues with existing import and export RPCs, these have been disabled. To import\n+into a Descriptor Wallet, a new `importdescriptors` RPC has been added that uses a syntax similar\n+to that of `importmulti`.\n+\n+Because Descriptor Wallets are storing different records and data from Legacy Wallets, existing\n+export RPCs are disabled for Descriptor Wallets. New export RPCs for Descriptor Wallets have\n+not yet been added.\n+\n+The following RPCs have been disabled for Descriptor Wallets:\n+\n+* importprivkey\n+* importpubkey\n+* importaddress\n+* importwallet\n+* dumpprivkey\n+* dumpwallet\n+* importmulti\n+* addmultisigaddress\n+* sethdseed\n+\n+#### Watchonly Wallets\n+\n+In Legacy Wallets, a wallet could contain both private keys and scripts that were being watched.\n+Those watched scripts would not contribute to your normal balance. In order to see the watchonly\n+balance and to use watchonly things in transactions, an `include_watchonly` option as added\n+to many RPCs that would allow users to do that. However this is confusing and easy to mess up.\n+\n+Descriptor Wallets move to a split watchonly model. Instead an entire wallet is considered to be\n+watchonly depending on whether it was created with private keys disabled. This eliminates the need\n+to distinguish between things that are watchonly and things that are not within a wallet itself.\n+\n+This change does have a caveat. If a Descriptor Wallet with private keys *enabled* and has\n+both single key (e.g. wpkh(...)) and multiple key descriptors (e.g. multi(...) with only one private",

Descriptor Wallets store\n+scriptPubKey information using descriptors. This is in contrast to the Legacy Wallet\n+structure where keys are used to generate scriptPubKeys and addresses.

A `descriptors` option has been added to `createwallet`.\n+Setting `descriptors` to `true` will create a Descriptor Wallet instead of a Legacy Wallet.\n+\n+In the GUI, a checkbox has been added to the Create Wallet Dialog do indicate that a\n+Descriptor Wallet should be created.\n+\n+Without those options being set, a Legacy Wallet will be created instead.

Legacy Wallets\n+have a confusing definition of `IsMine` due to using keys. Keys can be involved in a variety\n+of different scripts and many of those scripts are considered part of the wallet. This results\n+in scripts being part of the wallet that the user is not necessarily aware of.\n+\n+With Descriptor Wallets, descriptors explicitly specify the set of scripts that are owned by\n+the wallet. Since descriptors are deterministic and easily enumerable, users will know exactly\n+what scripts the wallet will consider to belong to it. Additionally the implementation of `IsMine`\n+in Descriptor Wallets is far simpler than for Legacy Wallets. Notably, in Legacy Wallets, `IsMine`\n+allowed for users to take one type of address (e.g. P2PKH), mutate it into another address type\n+(e.g. P2WPKH), and the wallet would still detect outputs sending to the new address type\n+even without that address being requested from the wallet. Descriptor Wallets does not\n+allow for this and will only watch for the addresses that were explicitly requested from the wallet.\n+\n+These changes to `IsMine` will make it easier to reason about what scripts the wallet will\n+actually be watching for in outputs. However for the vast majority of users, this change is\n+largely transparent and will not have noticeable effect.\n+\n+#### Imports and Exports\n+\n+Descriptor Wallets handles imports differently from Legacy Wallets. In Legacy Wallets, imports\n+are treated separately from the keys generated by the wallet. This separation is part of the\n+watchonly behavior for Legacy Wallets and is also confusing, especially in combination with\n+the `IsMine` behavior. With Descriptor Wallets, only complete descriptors can be imported. These\n+descriptors are then just added to the wallet as if it were a descriptor generated by the wallet\n+itself. To avoid issues with existing import and export RPCs, these have been disabled. To import\n+into a Descriptor Wallet, a new `importdescriptors` RPC has been added that uses a syntax similar\n+to that of `importmulti`.\n+\n+Because Descriptor Wallets are storing different records and data from Legacy Wallets, existing\n+export RPCs are disabled for Descriptor Wallets.

Descriptor Wallets store\n+scriptPubKey information using descriptors. This is in contrast to the Legacy Wallet\n+structure where keys are used to generate scriptPubKeys and addresses. Because of this\n+shift to being script based instead of key based, many of the confusing things that Legacy\n+Wallets do are not possible with Descriptor Wallets. Descriptor Wallets use a definition\n+of \"mine\" for scripts which is simpler and more intuitive than that used by Legacy Wallets.\n+Descriptor Wallets also uses different semantics for watch-only things and imports.\n+\n+As Descriptor Wallets are a new type of wallet, their introduction does not affect existing wallets.\n+Users who already have a Bitcoin Core wallet can continue to use it as they did before without\n+any change in behavior. Newly created Legacy Wallets (which is the default type of wallet) will\n+behave as they did in previous versions of Bitcoin Core.\n+\n+For users who decide to use Descriptor Wallets, the differences between them and Legacy Wallets\n+is largely limited to non user facing things. For most users, Descriptor Wallets will behave\n+similarly to Legacy Wallets except in import/export use cases and watchonly wallets.\n+\n+#### Creating Descriptor Wallets\n+\n+Descriptor Wallets are not created by default. They must be explicitly created using the\n+`createwallet` RPC or via the GUI. A `descriptors` option has been added to `createwallet`.\n+Setting `descriptors` to `true` will create a Descriptor Wallet instead of a Legacy Wallet.\n+\n+In the GUI, a checkbox has been added to the Create Wallet Dialog do indicate that a\n+Descriptor Wallet should be created.\n+\n+Without those options being set, a Legacy Wallet will be created instead.

Legacy Wallets\n+have a confusing definition of `IsMine` due to using keys. Keys can be involved in a variety\n+of different scripts and many of those scripts are considered part of the wallet. This results\n+in scripts being part of the wallet that the user is not necessarily aware of.\n+\n+With Descriptor Wallets, descriptors explicitly specify the set of scripts that are owned by\n+the wallet. Since descriptors are deterministic and easily enumerable, users will know exactly\n+what scripts the wallet will consider to belong to it. Additionally the implementation of `IsMine`\n+in Descriptor Wallets is far simpler than for Legacy Wallets. Notably, in Legacy Wallets, `IsMine`\n+allowed for users to take one type of address (e.g. P2PKH), mutate it into another address type\n+(e.g. P2WPKH), and the wallet would still detect outputs sending to the new address type\n+even without that address being requested from the wallet. Descriptor Wallets does not\n+allow for this and will only watch for the addresses that were explicitly requested from the wallet.\n+\n+These changes to `IsMine` will make it easier to reason about what scripts the wallet will\n+actually be watching for in outputs. However for the vast majority of users, this change is\n+largely transparent and will not have noticeable effect.\n+\n+#### Imports and Exports\n+\n+Descriptor Wallets handles imports differently from Legacy Wallets.

Descriptor Wallets store\n+scriptPubKey information using descriptors. This is in contrast to the Legacy Wallet\n+structure where keys are used to generate scriptPubKeys and addresses. Because of this\n+shift to being script based instead of key based, many of the confusing things that Legacy\n+Wallets do are not possible with Descriptor Wallets. Descriptor Wallets use a definition\n+of \"mine\" for scripts which is simpler and more intuitive than that used by Legacy Wallets.\n+Descriptor Wallets also uses different semantics for watch-only things and imports.\n+\n+As Descriptor Wallets are a new type of wallet, their introduction does not affect existing wallets.\n+Users who already have a Bitcoin Core wallet can continue to use it as they did before without\n+any change in behavior. Newly created Legacy Wallets (which is the default type of wallet) will\n+behave as they did in previous versions of Bitcoin Core.\n+\n+For users who decide to use Descriptor Wallets, the differences between them and Legacy Wallets\n+is largely limited to non user facing things. For most users, Descriptor Wallets will behave\n+similarly to Legacy Wallets except in import/export use cases and watchonly wallets.\n+\n+#### Creating Descriptor Wallets\n+\n+Descriptor Wallets are not created by default. They must be explicitly created using the\n+`createwallet` RPC or via the GUI. A `descriptors` option has been added to `createwallet`.\n+Setting `descriptors` to `true` will create a Descriptor Wallet instead of a Legacy Wallet.\n+\n+In the GUI, a checkbox has been added to the Create Wallet Dialog do indicate that a\n+Descriptor Wallet should be created.\n+\n+Without those options being set, a Legacy Wallet will be created instead. Additionally the\n+Default Wallet created upon first startup of Bitcoin Core will be a Legacy Wallet.\n+\n+#### `IsMine` Semantics\n+\n+`IsMine` refers to the function used to determine whether a script belongs to the wallet.\n+This is then used to determine whether an output belongs to the wallet. Legacy Wallets\n+have a confusing definition of `IsMine` due to using keys. Keys can be involved in a variety\n+of different scripts and many of those scripts are considered part of the wallet. This results\n+in scripts being part of the wallet that the user is not necessarily aware of.\n+\n+With Descriptor Wallets, descriptors explicitly specify the set of scripts that are owned by\n+the wallet. Since descriptors are deterministic and easily enumerable, users will know exactly\n+what scripts the wallet will consider to belong to it. Additionally the implementation of `IsMine`\n+in Descriptor Wallets is far simpler than for Legacy Wallets. Notably, in Legacy Wallets, `IsMine`\n+allowed for users to take one type of address (e.g. P2PKH), mutate it into another address type\n+(e.g. P2WPKH), and the wallet would still detect outputs sending to the new address type\n+even without that address being requested from the wallet. Descriptor Wallets does not\n+allow for this and will only watch for the addresses that were explicitly requested from the wallet.\n+\n+These changes to `IsMine` will make it easier to reason about what scripts the wallet will\n+actually be watching for in outputs. However for the vast majority of users, this change is\n+largely transparent and will not have noticeable effect.\n+\n+#### Imports and Exports\n+\n+Descriptor Wallets handles imports differently from Legacy Wallets. In Legacy Wallets, imports\n+are treated separately from the keys generated by the wallet. This separation is part of the\n+watchonly behavior for Legacy Wallets and is also confusing, especially in combination with\n+the `IsMine` behavior. With Descriptor Wallets, only complete descriptors can be imported. These\n+descriptors are then just added to the wallet as if it were a descriptor generated by the wallet\n+itself.

Additionally the implementation of `IsMine`\n+in Descriptor Wallets is far simpler than for Legacy Wallets.
