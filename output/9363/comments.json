    "body": "@gmaxwell I think you misunderstand the purpose of this PR, but I realised I have not really explained it.\r\n\r\nThe current functionality is that getblocktxns requests are ignored for old blocks (old defined by superceeded by 10 or more blocks) UNLESS they are blocks on an alt chain, in which case the request is accepted as long as their height on the alt chain is within 10 of the height on the active chain.\r\n\r\nDepending on when the alt chain forked, the block heights could have become out of sync with the active chain and not be representative of \"10 blocks ago\" based on the height check. i.e. on the alt chain, they could be blocks 20 blocks ago from that alt chain's tip, or if the difficulty really went down on the alt chain, they could be blocks from thousands of blocks ago (assuming the block time warp attack vulnerability still exists). Anyway, I realise the time warp attack would be incredibly expensive, and therefore unlikely to happen, but still, the code doesn't need to be vulnerable to this, IMHO. (And yes, I know that if a time warp occurred there would be \"bigger\" things to worry about than fingerprinting).\r\n\r\nThis change therefore changes the check to go back only the equivalent of 10 blocks in terms of work, after-all it is the work which decides which is the winning fork (as of version 0.3.3 anyway), not the height. The deciding factor for the re-org should surely be used here, not an irrelevant factor (i.e. the height).",

The way to make it exactly 10 would be to perhaps use -->pprev->pprev->pprev etc to get back to the block 10 ago (of course checking that nHeight is at least 11 also, or maybe the smallest height  that compact blocks became active), but I decided against this approach as the code was more complex for little extra gain.",
