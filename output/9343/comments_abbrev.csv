morcos,2016-12-14T12:59:44Z,"No.  That will still work the same.  In that case you wouldn't have had any change anyway.\n\nIn any case, it won't result in you sending more/different coins than you otherwise would have, it just might result in you not receiving back a very small (at the dust limit) coin, which I think is a positive change.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9343#issuecomment-267027677,267027677,
