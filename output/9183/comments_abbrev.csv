morcos,2016-11-28T19:17:21Z,"cautious ACK \n\nThis looks good to me, I code reviewed, and did some light testing.  I was a bit hesitant about moving NotifyHeaderTip before the rest of the header processing, but that seems to be mostly async behavior.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9183#issuecomment-263365930,263365930,

theuni,2016-11-23T23:02:40Z,Seems if one fails we don't actually know which? Or is there some async event?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9183#discussion_r89412897,89412897,src/main.cpp
theuni,2016-11-23T23:07:29Z,"I think this is probably fine now, but reusing state and assuming that it's only interesting if AcceptBlockHeader fails seems like it's asking for future bugs.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9183#discussion_r89413304,89413304,src/main.cpp
TheBlueMatt,2016-11-23T23:46:42Z,"Thats true, though I dont think any code actually needs to know which currently? If its needed at some point its easy to add an async event and/or additional return value.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9183#discussion_r89416678,89416678,src/main.cpp
TheBlueMatt,2016-11-23T23:48:47Z,Hmm...I'm sure this isnt the only place we do this. Would definitely need an audit to figure out all the places this is true if we ever want to change state meaning.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9183#discussion_r89416851,89416851,src/main.cpp

TheBlueMatt,2016-12-01T20:35:22Z,"the {} creates the vector that ProcessNewBlockHeaders takes, instead of a single header as AcceptBlockHeader does (note that it makes a copy of the header, but nbd, I think).",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9183#discussion_r90531839,90531839,src/main.cpp
