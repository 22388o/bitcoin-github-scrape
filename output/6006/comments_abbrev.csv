jonasschnelli,2015-04-12T13:02:04Z,PS:\nbitcoin-cli is untouched for now. As discussed on IRC it could be possible to have something like `bitcoin-cli -w getnewaddress` (-w stands for --wallet which would send the commands to `/wallet`). Unclear for now is how it would handle json type conversion (minor issue IMO).\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6006#issuecomment-92056634,92056634,
jgarzik,2015-04-12T15:09:09Z,"I thought about this long ago.\n\nJSON-RPC is really built around a single endpoint through which all information is exchanged.  It's essentially a messaging tunnel. This PR changes that model, without apparent need.\n\nIt did not seem to make sense to add another level like this, when you can easily just add new methods.  Convention ""mining.$name"" or ""wallet.$name"" can easily suffice, and registe",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6006#issuecomment-92077798,92077798,
jonasschnelli,2015-04-12T15:40:20Z,"Recently there was a discussion on IRC about this topic (gmaxwell, sipa, wumpus)  http://bitcoinstats.com/irc/bitcoin-dev/logs/2015/04/10#l1428649319\nIt came out that a new url endpoint makes most sense.\n\nThe signaling in this PR hooks in after the JSON Parsing and before the JSONReply. It basically allows bypassing of the raw RPC function and will reuse the whole HTTP/RPC/JSON stack.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6006#issuecomment-92082219,92082219,
laanwj,2015-04-15T08:55:09Z,"@jgarzik Right, that's also direction I assumed we'd go in for namespacing, but @gmaxwell was arguing against that approach on IRC recently and preferred multiple endpoints.\n\nAn argument for multiple endpoints is that it makes it easier to transition to separate processes, as client software would support different URIs already.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6006#issuecomment-93269347,93269347,

jonasschnelli,2015-04-16T08:28:19Z,Slightly updated:\n- reduced to only one signal (ExtCmdExecute)\n- removed signaling while creating help message (not required when having a different entry point uri)\n- additional uri schemas can be added over a static function instead over signaling (while RPC server is not running to avoid locking)\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6006#issuecomment-93677092,93677092,

jonasschnelli,2015-04-24T12:06:50Z,"I agree with @sipa. My goal with this PR was to not touch the current wallet implementation. Therefor i only allowed/added the signaling in non root URI spaces, in hope to get more reviews because its behavior is more save and understandable.\n\nIf – and i tried and will try again – the current wallet will become a module, we should completely modularize the JSON RPC request/response handling.\nBu",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6006#issuecomment-95911801,95911801,
