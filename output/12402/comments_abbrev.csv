achow101,2018-02-25T04:58:48Z,It looks like ccache's bundled zlib is failing to build with mingw which is causing #12515. This was also reported in IRC as causing an issue with a new gitian setup.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12402#issuecomment-368283560,368283560,

droark,2018-03-03T00:40:40Z,Any chance this can get ported over to the 0.16 branch? I'm trying to do Gitian builds right now. Maybe it's a coincidence but Sourceforge chokes whenever Gitian attempts to download expat.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12402#issuecomment-370098383,370098383,
