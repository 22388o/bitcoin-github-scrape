Is it part of a larger set of changes that I can look at or part of a larger design that you can describe somewhere?\n\nThe map doesn't seem to make sense for unloading because wallet interfaces are created on the fly and you can't identify them by pointer.

It would seem more appropriate to use `list<<pair<>>` instead of `map<>` if there are no lookups comparing map keys. But it is hard to evaluate this when there is no description of the overall design motivating this change and no justification for why a splash screen wallet data structure should exist at all.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13070#issuecomment-384444620,384444620,
