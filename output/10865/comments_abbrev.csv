bytting,2017-07-20T20:53:57Z,"I think I got the squashing right, thanks for the assistance :smiley:\n\nAs far as I can see, SOCKET is defined as an unsigned int on both platforms, so passing it by value seems reasonable.\n\nIt seems to me that both SetSocketNoDelay, InterrupibleRecv and IsSelectableSocket could benefit from const arguments as well.\n\nPS. I just realized I updated the patch with more code after approval.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10865#issuecomment-316826827,316826827,
bytting,2017-07-22T07:18:32Z,"@theuni \nI made an update to this patch. It should now move CloseSocket out of SetSocketNonBlocking and pass sockets as const reference to some utility functions.\n\nPlease comment if you have any issues with this.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10865#issuecomment-317162784,317162784,
