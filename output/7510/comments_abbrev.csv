laanwj,2016-02-11T07:40:15Z,"We've discussed this on IRC.\n\nI'm not a big fan of adding yet another options source. The GUI already has command line, bitcoin.conf and QSettings - in that order of precedence. This has caused many complications and bugs in the past, especially during initialization, only now it seems to have cooled down a bit so I'm not really happy to stir the ants' nest again (we don't have a test suite for ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7510#issuecomment-182750382,182750382,
luke-jr,2016-02-11T08:01:33Z,"This doesn't change initialisation at all, it uses the same code as bitcoin.conf for that. For now, everything currently in QSettings remains in QSettings (although upgrading them wouldn't be very difficult or risky, it's not really an immediate goal).\n\nQSettings is not really a good solution since bitcoind won't use it (I can't think of any use case where you'd want these kind of settings diffe",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7510#issuecomment-182756445,182756445,
laanwj,2016-02-11T08:29:01Z,"> QSettings is not really a good solution since bitcoind won't use it\n\nThat's certainly a valid argument for using our own system instead of QSettings for core settings.\n\nIf you add a test suite that tests interaction between various parameter sources, as well as backwards compatibility, I'd feel better about this. I just don't want to introduce a new source of stress.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7510#issuecomment-182761330,182761330,
