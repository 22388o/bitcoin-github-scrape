jnewbery,2018-12-13T19:18:50Z,Can you add a comment to `add_nodes()` explaining why it should only be called once.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14951#issuecomment-447087493,447087493,
MarcoFalke,2018-12-13T20:10:12Z,Is there a reason other than it being the design we want it to? I added a comment to mention that it should be called once after the parameters for all nodes have been set up.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14951#issuecomment-447104226,447104226,
jnewbery,2018-12-13T21:14:15Z,"> Is there a reason other than it being the design we want it to?\n\nThat's really it. Some of the test framework infrastructure relies on the `num_nodes` not changing. We *could* change that, but I think declaring the number of nodes at the start of the test is a good thing to do anyway.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14951#issuecomment-447122829,447122829,
stevenroose,2018-12-14T10:25:16Z,"> I added a comment to mention that it should be called once after the parameters for all nodes have been set up.\n\nThat's what a method `setup_nodes` would be expected to do, IMO :)\n\nFair enough. So the correct was is to call `add_nodes` once and build a list of the binaries, chain names, etc beforehand?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14951#issuecomment-447282484,447282484,
jnewbery,2018-12-14T15:41:19Z,"> So the correct was is to call add_nodes once and build a list of the binaries, chain names, etc beforehand?\n\nYes. If necessary, the node's arguments and config file can be updated later with `TestNode.args` and `append_config()`.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14951#issuecomment-447362594,447362594,
