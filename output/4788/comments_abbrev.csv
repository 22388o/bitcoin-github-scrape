jtimon,2014-08-29T21:15:38Z,"By the way, it would be interesting for the pull tester or travis to also build this mode, maybe the one without gui too. Also, are there many users that disable the wallet but don't disable the gui? maybe --disable-wallet should imply --without-gui ?\nI can imagine more users disabling the gui but not the wallet though.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4788#issuecomment-53930800,53930800,

theuni,2014-08-29T21:35:30Z,"@jtimon There is a travis build that disables the wallet to try to catch problems like this, though it disables the gui as well (its purpose is to test the minimum config). I'm not sure if there is enough reason to justify adding a row to the matrix for this corner case?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4788#issuecomment-53932619,53932619,

No one will use disable-wallet mode, which is intended to be the future of Bitcoin Core, if it offers no basic GUI.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4788#issuecomment-53946623,53946623,
