theuni,2015-02-02T14:49:24Z,"@jgarzik: I think that's actually a point worth addressing in the workflow. Ideally all changes would be explained, but often they depend on the original PR. For the next merge, I'll look into grabbing the PR description, since it won't necessarily be coming from the bitcoin repo.\n\n@laanwj Thanks for the thorough review.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5731#issuecomment-72468940,72468940,
jgarzik,2015-02-02T14:53:36Z,"@theuni As @gmaxwell and I have pointed out in the past, what matters is what _goes into the git repo_ and appears in the git history.\n\nForcing people to perform research just to figure the ""why"" of a commit is a sign of a broken commit description (and broken process).\n\nThe trivial tree should not be dropping crucial information.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5731#issuecomment-72469620,72469620,
