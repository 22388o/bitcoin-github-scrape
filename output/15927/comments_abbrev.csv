jnewbery,2019-04-30 20:40:10,@MarcoFalke - is there a good reason? Is it just so these options get picked up before the conf file is read?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15927#issuecomment-488106904,488106904,

jonatack,2019-05-06 10:53:28,"Hi John, I tried to test this (recompiled, ran various functional tests, added changes to make them fail), and was unable to find a change in logging.

MarcoFalke,2019-05-06 13:22:42,@jonatack Good catch. I suggest to extend some `assert_debug_log` with a string that also matches the thread name. Maybe in script checking or net?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15927#issuecomment-489618315,489618315,
