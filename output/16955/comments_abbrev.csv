emilengler,2019-09-24 19:48:20,"See line 95 in `qt/walletcontroller.cpp`\nThere it checks if the wallet is empty even though it isn't null (I think).",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16955#discussion_r327801771,327801771,src/qt/walletcontroller.cpp
icota,2019-09-25 08:18:44,@promag In case you call `loadwallet` very early in `bitcoin-qt` init. @fanquake has written a python script in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/16937 that triggers it consistently.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16955#discussion_r327988881,327988881,src/qt/walletcontroller.cpp

promag,2019-09-25 12:19:45,"Sorry, forgot to update this, see #16963.\n\nNote that conceptually you are being notified about a new wallet, it should exist! Also this change hides a more severe problem which is explained in my PR.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16955#discussion_r328088147,328088147,src/qt/walletcontroller.cpp
