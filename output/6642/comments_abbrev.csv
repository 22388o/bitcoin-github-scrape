gmaxwell,2015-09-07T01:45:08Z,"Our time system has a resolution of one second and huge inherent systemic errors vs UTC (e.g. we do not handle leap seconds). In blocks, latencies in the mining process usually make their times tens of seconds off (and misconfigurations make them minutes off).\n\nThe network also has infinite gain, e.g. there is no inherent bias to drive it back in sync with UTC except for corner case limitations ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6642#issuecomment-138153826,138153826,
gmaxwell,2015-09-07T02:08:40Z,I did a cursory check for step 6 side effects having any effect before the end and did not find any. Before accepting that change a more careful examination should be done in review.   I think deferring binding until later in setup is likely reasonable regardless of the timing handling.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6642#issuecomment-138157752,138157752,
MarcoFalke,2015-09-07T08:10:52Z,"Indeed, e12d0ad is relevant only in less than 0.5%, correcting the insignificant one second offset on my machine.\n\nTo check if 0ac42c4 works, you could pick a server with a public IP address which some other nodes actively try to connect to. Then just restart the server (or even do something costly like reindex). In the meantime you can see the other nodes `PushVersion()` to your server.

laanwj,2015-10-06T08:13:49Z,"As it is not clear to me what practical issue this solves - the time sync logic is a bit dodgy in the first place, and as @gmaxwell already says absolute precision is not important for our use caes - I'm not willing to take the risk of breaking the initialization sequence, sorry.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6642#issuecomment-145777898,145777898,
