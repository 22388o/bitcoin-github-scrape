    "body": "Our time system has a resolution of one second and huge inherent systemic errors vs UTC (e.g. we do not handle leap seconds). In blocks, latencies in the mining process usually make their times tens of seconds off (and misconfigurations make them minutes off).\n\nThe network also has infinite gain, e.g. there is no inherent bias to drive it back in sync with UTC except for corner case limitations in the correction procedure.\n\nFortunately, we do not use the time in any ways in which precision is important. (which is also fortunate because making it precise and consistent without centralization is an unsolved problem!)\n\nGiven that, I am not sure that an offset of even as much as 20000 microseconds is at all interesting.\n\nAre you aware of a case where this matters?\n",

    "body": "Indeed, e12d0ad is relevant only in less than 0.5%, correcting the insignificant one second offset on my machine.\n\nTo check if 0ac42c4 works, you could pick a server with a public IP address which some other nodes actively try to connect to. Then just restart the server (or even do something costly like reindex). In the meantime you can see the other nodes `PushVersion()` to your server. So `nTimeOffset =` whatever it took you to reindex, etc.\n",
