  "body": "Add experimental syscall sandboxing using seccomp-bpf (Linux secure computing mode).\r\n\r\nEnable filtering of system calls using seccomp-bpf: allow only explicitly allowlisted (expected) syscalls to be called. \r\n\r\nThe syscall sandboxing implemented in this PR is an experimental feature currently available only under Linux x86-64.\r\n\r\nTo enable the experimental syscall sandbox the `-sandbox=<mode>` option must be passed to `bitcoind`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  -sandbox=<mode>\r\n       Use the experimental syscall sandbox in the specified mode\r\n       (-sandbox=log-and-abort or -sandbox=abort). Allow only expected\r\n       syscalls to be used by bitcoind. Note that this is an\r\n       experimental new feature that may cause bitcoind to exit or crash\r\n       unexpectedly: use with caution. In the \"log-and-abort\" mode the\r\n       invocation of an unexpected syscall results in a debug handler\r\n       being invoked which will log the incident and terminate the\r\n       program (without executing the unexpected syscall). In the\r\n       \"abort\" mode the invocation of an unexpected syscall results in\r\n       the entire process being killed immediately by the kernel without\r\n       executing the unexpected syscall.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe allowed syscalls are defined on a per thread basis.\r\n\r\nI've used this feature since summer 2020 and I find it to be a helpful testing/debugging addition which makes it much easier to reason about the actual capabilities required of each type of thread in Bitcoin Core.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nQuick start guide:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ./configure\r\n$ src/bitcoind -regtest -debug=util -sandbox=log-and-abort\r\n\u2026\r\n2021-06-09T12:34:56Z Experimental syscall sandbox enabled (-sandbox=log-and-abort): bitcoind will terminate if an unexpected (not allowlisted) syscall is invoked.\r\n\u2026\r\n2021-06-09T12:34:56Z Syscall filter installed for thread \"addcon\"\r\n2021-06-09T12:34:56Z Syscall filter installed for thread \"dnsseed\"\r\n2021-06-09T12:34:56Z Syscall filter installed for thread \"net\"\r\n2021-06-09T12:34:56Z Syscall filter installed for thread \"msghand\"\r\n2021-06-09T12:34:56Z Syscall filter installed for thread \"opencon\"\r\n2021-06-09T12:34:56Z Syscall filter installed for thread \"init\"\r\n\u2026\r\n# A simulated execve call to show the sandbox in action:\r\n2021-06-09T12:34:56Z ERROR: The syscall \"execve\" (syscall number 59) is not allowed by the syscall sandbox in thread \"msghand\".

Should it attempt any other system calls, the kernel will terminate the process with SIGKILL or SIGSYS. In this sense, it does not virtualize the system's resources but isolates the process from them entirely.\r\n>\r\n> [\u2026]\r\n> \r\n> seccomp-bpf is an extension to seccomp that allows filtering of system calls using a configurable policy implemented using Berkeley Packet Filter rules. It is used by OpenSSH and vsftpd as well as the Google Chrome/Chromium web browsers on Chrome OS and Linux. (In this regard seccomp-bpf achieves similar functionality, but with more flexibility and higher performance, to the older systrace\u2014which seems to be no longer supported for Linux.)",
