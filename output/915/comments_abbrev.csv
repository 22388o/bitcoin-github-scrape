gavinandresen,2012-03-03T16:57:30Z,Should you make it fTestNet ||   ... so it is running on testnet for a while before the switch on main net?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/915#discussion_r514816,514816,src/main.cpp
sipa,2012-03-03T16:59:54Z,"That's possible, but enabling it for every block on testnet, will cause the current testnet chain to become invalid. I prefer switching testnet somewhere in the past, but after roconnor's tests.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/915#discussion_r514819,514819,src/main.cpp
