jonasschnelli,2016-06-03T18:00:07Z,"""not set"" stands for ""not setting"" a specific feerate. IMO it's better if we say the default value is the estimated feerate.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8144#issuecomment-223649381,223649381,
jonasschnelli,2016-06-03T18:01:16Z,Or also include something about `txconfirmtarget` (which fundrawtransaction uses for fee estimation).\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8144#issuecomment-223649688,223649688,
MarcoFalke,2016-06-03T18:15:52Z,"With ""default not set"" I mean that the option is disabled/not considered/ignored. Better suggestions welcome.\n\nCurrently it says that the default will be the estimated fee rate, which is wrong. Also it may change in the future so you can't ""hardcode"" it.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8144#issuecomment-223653304,223653304,
sipa,2016-06-03T18:18:01Z,"Even better would be to add another option to fundrawtransaction to set the\nconfirmation target for estimation. Then you can say that if feerate is not\nset, the set target is used for estimating it. If that target is not set,\nthe default is used.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8144#issuecomment-223653898,223653898,
MarcoFalke,2016-06-03T18:27:32Z,"As I understand this, you'd be breaking compatibility (basically a weak version of  #7633, so at least mention in the release notes would be required).

jonasschnelli,2016-06-06T18:07:50Z,I kinda agree with @laanwj. The feeRate option has not been deployed. We could still change it to BTC/kb to be consistent with the rest of the API.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8144#discussion_r65938889,65938889,src/wallet/rpcwallet.cpp
