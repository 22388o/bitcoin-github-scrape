droark,2016-12-09T03:43:58Z,"Note that, while the code is written to support the entire linearization process, the primary purpose is to help support other libraries. For example, python-bitcoinlib's *getblock* call requires a little endian hash; the library converts the endianness internally before making the actual RPC call. Being able to write a hash list with linearize-hashes.py that's compatible with such libraries is, I",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9304#issuecomment-265926244,265926244,

petertodd,2016-12-15T10:53:17Z,"@droark Wait, why do you think python-bitcoinlib needs little-endian? There's both x() and lx() to convert a hex-encoded has to the binary representation in big and little-endian form.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9304#issuecomment-267298903,267298903,

If I take the linearization-hashes output as-is, convert it into bytes, and try to feed it into a getblock() call, python-bitcoinlib chokes. If I reverse the bytes, as seen in this PR, python-bitcoinlib is happy. Even if this is a bug ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9304#issuecomment-267433807,267433807,
