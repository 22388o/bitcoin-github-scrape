theuni,2015-01-20T01:05:20Z,"@jonasschnelli Please review/pull in the top 3 commits here: https://github.com/theuni/bitcoin/commits/osx-background-image . They'll fix OSX builds from Linux/Gitian after these changes.\n\nThese sync up the way that we deal with the background images.

jonasschnelli,2015-01-20T08:26:45Z,"@theuni \nPerfect. I reviewed the three commits (82f9b72, e9383dc, 439b352). Looks good to me. ACK with the nit/question of the output size factor.\n\nAlso updated the image once again to center the text. I was getting inspired by the firefox background image (there the ""Firefox"" text is also left aligned). But centered looks good IMO.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5683#issuecomment-70619638,70619638,
