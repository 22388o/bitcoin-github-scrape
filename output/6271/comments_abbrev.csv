jonasschnelli,2015-06-12T20:17:36Z,Tested ACK.\nWould be cool if you could pull in this RPC test (two commits):\nhttps://github.com/jonasschnelli/bitcoin/commit/ef4647a8ae2973cd02662752add7e7ba2e926de2 and https://github.com/jonasschnelli/bitcoin/commit/d20a3896460370f0f2564cd4db8d2ee16834a836\nfrom https://github.com/jonasschnelli/bitcoin/tree/DisconnectNode\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6271#issuecomment-111603267,111603267,
Alex-van-der-Peet,2015-06-13T02:04:15Z,"@jonasschelli Just to avoid git confusion, you're asking me to add a source in git for your branch, merge the changes into mine and push it back? That's ok, I won't see my dev machine untli Monday though.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6271#issuecomment-111654960,111654960,
laanwj,2015-06-13T05:01:02Z,"@Alex-van-der-Peet yes, except you should use `git cherry-pick` instead of merging; git merges and github pulls interact very badly. If it's too much trouble we can add the tests in another pull.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6271#issuecomment-111670305,111670305,
jonasschnelli,2015-06-13T07:47:38Z,"@Alex-van-der-Peet: right. You need to add my remote `git remote add jonasschnelli https://github.com/jonasschnelli/bitcoin`, then you can fetch via `git fetch jonasschnelli`, then you can cherry pick the two commits: `git cherry-pick ef4647a8ae2973cd02662752add7e7ba2e926de2` and `git cherry-pick d20a3896460370f0f2564cd4db8d2ee16834a836`\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6271#issuecomment-111685320,111685320,
laanwj,2015-06-16T12:17:34Z,"@jonasschnelli To make it easier for our new contributor I'm going to go ahead and merge this without the tests, we can add those in a separate pull (or as part of #6158, even better)\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6271#issuecomment-112404168,112404168,

jonasschnelli,2015-06-16T14:58:38Z,@laanwj: Good idea. Will try to include the tests in #6158.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6271#issuecomment-112461729,112461729,
laanwj,2015-06-12T07:35:09Z,"I think it should raise an error when the node is not found. e.g.\n\n``` c++\nif (pNode == NULL)\n    throw JSONRPCError(RPC_NOT_FOUND, ""Node not found in connected nodes"");\n```\n\nThis makes it possible to see if an operation actually happened.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6271#discussion_r32295391,32295391,src/rpcnet.cpp
jonasschnelli,2015-06-12T07:45:17Z,+1 @laanwj \nI would also remove the 'strNode' round trip and directly add params[0].get_str() within FindNode()\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6271#discussion_r32295915,32295915,src/rpcnet.cpp
laanwj,2015-06-15T07:37:04Z,@jonasschnelli\nI don't see the connection to add these tests in `httpbasics.py` (even renaming it). Let's add a seperate test script for (upcoming) RPC node disconnect/ban/etc handling?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6271#discussion_r32396969,32396969,qa/rpc-tests/netbasics.py
jonasschnelli,2015-06-15T07:53:31Z,I was trying to save some precious test time because another test will at least add another chain init and maybe mining of 100blocks on the top.\nBut right. A separate test could make sense if we look what else could get in there. Will do so.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6271#discussion_r32397769,32397769,qa/rpc-tests/netbasics.py
laanwj,2015-06-15T08:25:49Z,"Saving time is not worth it at the expense of sanity :)\nMaybe the chain init can be avoided for tests like this that don't need a chain?\n\nIn any case - httpbasics will become more extensive when we switch HTTP servers, so keeping the just-HTTP tests in a script of their own makes sense.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6271#discussion_r32399551,32399551,qa/rpc-tests/netbasics.py
