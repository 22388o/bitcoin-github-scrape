I don't think it needs a complicated fix.  Just change GetPriority to calculate the priority of each of the inputs.  For unconfirmed inputs, they count as 0.  It's a more expensive calculation than the current method, but with my PR the calculation call will only need to be done once each time the active chain changes, and then the result is cached in CTxMemPoolEntry.\n\nI'm happy to include a fix in my PR if people agree.\n",

I wouldn't mind implementing it or suggesting it for you to implement, but the big IF here is whether all this complication is necessary.  Even if this priority calculation were cheap, is looping the entire mempool on every block to update priorities something we actually want to do?  \n\nI'd be more in favor of ditching the priority sorting and free transaction inclusion policy altogether.
