laanwj,2018-05-09T08:15:39Z,Would be better in `src/fs.h`?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13195#discussion_r186964585,186964585,src/util.h
laanwj,2018-05-09T08:16:46Z,string encoding should probably be in `utilstrencodings.[ch]`,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13195#discussion_r186964901,186964901,src/util.cpp
