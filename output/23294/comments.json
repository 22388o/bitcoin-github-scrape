    "body": "@stratospher \r\n\r\nThe \"include-what-you-use\" policy is used in Bitcoin Core. See the \"Source code organization\" section in the [developer notes](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/developer-notes.md):\r\n\r\n- Every `.cpp` and `.h` file should `#include` every header file it directly uses classes, functions or other\r\n  definitions from, even if those headers are already included indirectly through other headers.\r\n\r\n  - *Rationale*: Excluding headers because they are already indirectly included results in compilation\r\n    failures when those indirect dependencies change. Furthermore, it obscures what the real code\r\n    dependencies are.\r\n",
