Users\n+---------------------------------\n+\n+This .service file assumes bitcoind user and group exist in the system, so packager\n+should make sure they are created on installation. \n+\n+2. Files\n+---------------------------------\n+\n+The .service file assumes several paths that might need to be adjusted according\n+to packager's needs.\n+\n+Daemon's config file is assumed to be located at /etc/bitcoind.conf (you can\n+use contrib/debian/examples/bitcoin.conf as an example). Once installed, users\n+must edit the file in order to update at least these two \n+values: rpcuser and rpcpassword . Failing to do so will make the daemon fail \n+to boot. However, the message written to /var/lib/bitcoind/debug.log file is\n+very helpful and no default values should be set:\n+\n+    YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:DD Error: To use the \"-server\" option, you must set a rpcpassword in the configuration file:\n+    /etc/bitcoind.conf\n+    It is recommended you use the following random password:\n+    rpcuser=bitcoinrpc\n+    rpcpassword=HdYZ5HGtAF7mx8aTw6uCATtD2maMAK4E12Ysp4YNZQcX\n+    (you do not need to remember this password)\n+    The username and password MUST NOT be the same.\n+    If the file does not exist, create it with owner-readable-only file permissions.\n+    It is also recommended to set alertnotify so you are notified of problems;\n+    for example: alertnotify=echo %s | mail -s \"Bitcoin Alert\" admin@foo.com\n+\n+Daemon's data and pid files will be stored in /var/lib/bitcoind directory, so it\n+should be created on installation and make bitcoind user/group it's owner.\n+\n+3. Installing .service file\n+---------------------------------\n+\n+Installing this .service file consists on just copying it to /usr/lib/systemd/system\n+directory, followed by the command \"systemctl daemon-reload\" in order to update\n+running systemd configuration."
