Empact,2018-07-17T18:01:52Z,I'm unsure on 1d45dcd and dc0996f because they serve to help document the code.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13691#issuecomment-405672785,405672785,

practicalswift,2018-07-17T18:08:55Z,"@Empact Thanks for the quick review!\n\nI've now excluded dc0996f15ab99c8307bf63efd339cad20ddcb562 from this PR â€“ I see your point.\n\nRegarding 1d45dcd67dbb7319e9acd6dd36ce7106727cb18a, what does that add from a documentation viewpoint? `struct` has public access to its base classes by default. Perhaps I'm missing something :-)",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13691#issuecomment-405674918,405674918,
Empact,2018-07-17T18:23:53Z,"@practicalswift the value is modest, but the declaration makes the default explicit, removing an otherwise-required unit of knowledge for the reader. Avoids the risk of an inappropriate expectation or assumption, particularly relevant since `struct` and `class` differ in their defaults.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13691#issuecomment-405680537,405680537,
