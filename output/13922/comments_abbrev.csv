ajtowns,2018-08-09T06:20:30Z,"This was more complicated than I expected, so careful review would probably be a good idea. Possible things worth focusing on:\n\n * Maybe the default block min fee should be left as is, so miners have deliberately/voluntarily lower minimum fees?\n * I've not looked much at the estimation code, any maybe I'm misunderstanding how it works. And my code could have bugs.\n * There's no tests for u",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13922#issuecomment-411649683,411649683,

ajtowns,2018-10-10T01:38:59Z,"Repeating some in-person comments:\n\n * reducing the min incremental relay fee allows for cheap spamming, might be better to change the code so that the min incremental relay fee can be higher than the min relay fee, and leaving it higher (perhaps 200s/kB for relay, but 1000s/kB or 500s/kB for incremental relay/fee-bumping). Note that wallet defaults already have a higher incremental fee, so th",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13922#issuecomment-428408756,428408756,
