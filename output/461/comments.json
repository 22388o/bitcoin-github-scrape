Or to the default behaviour of qmake and make?\n\nI think that as long as for instance a simple \"make -f makefile.unix\" after a clean git checkout does not build cleanly on all major Linux distros due to version conflicts between bitcoin and libminiupnp, libminiupnp should better not be selected by default. If autotools can figure out whether using libminiupnp is possible later, great. But until then, I'd vote for upnp off by default in both bitcoin-qt and bitcoind.\n",

    "body": "@T_X in gavin's comment, build rule would refer to the default when calling make/qmake+make and the distributed binaries.\n\nPersonally, I don't care what the default is, the tri-state option was added because no one would agree on what the default for UPnP should be and thus it wasn't getting merged, so tri-state was added to move the process forward.  If you want to change it, go ahead, but even two different arguments would be clearer than tri-state (--have-upnp and --upnp-by-default or something).\n\nDistributing libminiupnpc? No way, we already distribute our own outdated, modified copy of json_spirit which we should never be doing.  We don't need to be distributing other outdated copies of software in our src.  Also, libminiupnpc is now in debian and gaining packages in other distros, so I'm not too concerned.  Also, users who know enough to be compiling bitcoin from source probably aren't using UPnP on their router anyway, so most people who this effects are just going to disable UPnP anyway.\n\nIn any case, if someone wants to put in the effort and actually make an update to the way UPnP is defined, go right ahead...this pull request is outdated and only halfway done.  It would be better to discuss updates specific to implementation instead of wandering around all day asking what we should do.\n",
