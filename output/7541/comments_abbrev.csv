dcousens,2016-02-16T22:21:58Z,tiny nit: `position` seems slightly non-conventional?\n\n> The **index** of the transaction in the block that includes it.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7541#discussion_r53089427,53089427,src/wallet/rpcwallet.cpp

laanwj,2016-02-17T09:01:01Z,"I'd prefer to stick with index too. It has a well-defined meaning, while position is too general (it could be a byte offset, or a set of 3D coordinates within the unit block...).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7541#discussion_r53135937,53135937,src/wallet/rpcwallet.cpp
