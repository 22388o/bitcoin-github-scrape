laanwj,2019-10-17 08:19:54,"Concept ACK.\n\nAs for implementation, I'm not sure about having `In` and `Out` as permissions.\n\nThis doesn't allow having different flags for a IP for incoming and outgoing. Not sure that's ever necessary, but this seems a bit muddled to me. Might also consider e.g. `whiteconnect` (for outgoing connections) could have a completely different flag list structure from the normal `whitelist` (f",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17167#issuecomment-543062796,543062796,
luke-jr,2019-10-17 12:50:00,"As you noticed, the implementation already doesn't treat in/out as permissions.\n\nUsing `-whitelist` for both allows for easily specifying the same flags for both in,out.

MarcoFalke,2020-09-05 10:58:17,"Previously whitelisting outgoing connections wasn't possible, so no guards have been added to protect those from disconnection. Would be good to revisit those places and evaluate if guards are needed.\n\nFor example commit c60fd71a65e841efe187992f46c583a704cc37f5 by @sdaftuar checks for `pfrom->fWhitelisted`, but the commit immediately after it (5a6d00c6defc587e22c93e63029fdd538ce8858d) removes ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17167#issuecomment-687590686,687590686,
