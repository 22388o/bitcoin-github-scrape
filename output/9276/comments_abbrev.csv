laanwj,2016-12-05T10:01:50Z,Another minor idea would be to remove explicit `-server` from the `bitcoind` command lines. That will catch a problem with the option (e.g. as in #9010) next time.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9276#issuecomment-264812877,264812877,

MarcoFalke,2016-12-06T11:13:01Z,"> third commit removes the obsolete file run-bitcoind-for-test.sh, but someone should check if I did this correctly, since now that I've removed it from .gitignore, everyones repos will complain that they have an extra file sitting around. i wasn't sure how to clean that up?\n\nEveryone who cares about a ""clean"" work dir can delete the file by themself.

At least it will make it obvious that there's a redundant file around and that they can delete it. Unlike when you keep it in gitignore.\n\nutACK 30b620c",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9276#issuecomment-265666239,265666239,
