maaku,2015-12-21T09:46:02Z,"Perhaps my question wasn't clear -- why limit the number of transactions at all? We should probably do overflow checks (which would mean a real limit of 4 billion transactions), but I'm not sure why this would ever be a purposefully, further constrained parameter.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7238#issuecomment-166252900,166252900,
jtimon,2015-12-21T10:10:55Z,"I guess another option would be to just replace `MAX_BLOCK_SIZE / 60` with a static constant in merkleblock.cpp.\nWhat you are saying is that changing that constant to a huge value wouldn't be a hardfork and it's therefore easier to just decouple merkleblock.cpp from MAX_BLOCK_SIZE, correct? \n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7238#issuecomment-166259311,166259311,
maaku,2015-12-22T07:07:30Z,"That check is really just a sanity check, and IMHO shouldn't be there as Merkle trees are used for other purposes. There is no reason to explicitly limit the number of transactions, and a generic merkle tree validator shouldn't have such a limitation built into it.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7238#issuecomment-166535862,166535862,
jtimon,2015-12-23T10:07:53Z,"Ok, so you suggest to just remove the check then?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7238#issuecomment-166853421,166853421,
