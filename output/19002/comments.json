    "body": "I misunderstood your previous comment, I thought you were suggesting that it should include the fee if we know the enough about the inputs to determine it. I now understand that you meant the exact opposite :)\r\n\r\nJust to clarify: this PR is about \"send\" transactions with inputs that are external to the wallet (i.e. coinjoined), not about supporting non-\"send\" transactions.\r\n\r\nI do agree with your point, looking at just the direct fee on its own without taking the feerate of unconfirmed parents and descendants into account isn't very useful. I found myself in the position of needing to report the fee for compatibility with an existing protocol, but now I'm re-considering if that's the right thing to do - perhaps its better to show no fee than a misleading one.\r\n\r\n(This could even potentially be abused by making a transaction paying just the relay fee, then a descendant transaction with a high feerate paying to a victim to make him mistakenly believe that its likely to get confirmed soon. But thankfully no one is accepting unconfirmed payments, right? :stuck_out_tongue:)",
