laanwj,2021-10-14 15:56:47,@katesalazar The policy is that we backport bugfixes to previous releases. The referenced issue seems a small cosmetic change that doesn't affect use of the software. So I'd say it's unnecessary. On the other hand it's also low-risk so if other people think it's nice to have I'm also not strongly against it.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23276#issuecomment-943492956,943492956,
