Only you care about whether it's not using more storage than necessary.\n\nI prefer the block-acceptance tests to remain implementation-independent, so it can remain as generic as possible, and be used to find bugs that could lead to non-convergence - not only for bitcoind/bitcoin-qt. If another implementation chooses not to implement pruning, that's their choice. Sure, it would change the economics of the system as a whole, but it's not a network rule violation to do so.\n\nOf course, if a some form of committed-UTXO-set-in-coinbase is ever added, the actual UTXO set becomes observable to the network rules, and this changes of course.\n\nWe need unit tests for verifying that provably-unspendable outputs do not end up in the UTXO set though.\n",

Maybe add a UTXO version number, and just increment it every time we change something? IMO it's fine to have a meta version -1 that gets set if you run some dev code that puts the UTXO database in a bad state or have a flag called \"utxo-consistent\" that is unset in that case.\n",
