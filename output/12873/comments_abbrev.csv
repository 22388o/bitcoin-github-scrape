jamesob,2018-04-04T17:45:15Z,Closing and re-opening in an attempt to get Travis to kick off a build - I was flagged (and then unflagged) as abusing Travis.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12873#issuecomment-378686062,378686062,
practicalswift,2018-04-09T14:20:42Z,@jamesob Try force pushing a change instead (say after changing the commit message) - that should trigger a Travis rebuild. Closing and re-opening an issue will create a notification to followers to I think force pushing is a better way to wake up Travis :-),https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12873#issuecomment-379768933,379768933,
jamesob,2018-04-09T15:19:26Z,"@practicalswift I'm really sorry about the spam, but force pushing isn't kicking off a Travis build for this PR (for reasons unknown to me). You can see above that @MarcoFalke had to do the same thing. I'll try opening a new PR next time I'd otherwise have to resort to an open/close.

practicalswift,2018-04-09T15:41:04Z,@jamesob You may want to contact Travis CI support and make sure you're account has not been flagged on their side. That happens and they're usually fixing that quickly after receiving a ticket about it.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12873#issuecomment-379796816,379796816,

I've been doing same and while I'm unable to reproduce on my 16.04 host, I've been able to reproduce reliably on a 14.04 VM.\n\nI think running the functional suite using the qt binary has uncovered a latent deadlock, perhaps due to 14.04's older default version of OpenSSL (1.0.1f) based on a tip from @TheBlueMatt. \n\nHere's some relevant log ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12873#issuecomment-384272761,384272761,
