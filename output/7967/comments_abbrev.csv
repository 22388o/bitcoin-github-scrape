jonasschnelli,2016-05-06T09:11:51Z,Added a commit that add an explicit boolean for overriding the estimated fee rate (`overrideFeeRate`). This would allow to use 0 as fee rate (zero fee transaction) but would require 0 as minRelayTxFee.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7967#issuecomment-217393145,217393145,

laanwj,2016-05-05T10:56:19Z,Concept ACK.\nThough should we be using '0' as a special marker value? What if you want to override it to 0? I think I'd prefer an explicit boolean 'overrideFeeRate'.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7967#discussion_r62173221,62173221,src/wallet/wallet.cpp
jonasschnelli,2016-05-05T11:09:07Z,"Yes. We could use an extra boolean (like `overrideFeeRate`). My thoughts where that a `CFeeRate(0)` is not practical but I agree, it would technically be possible to use a zero feerate. I'll add the bool.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7967#discussion_r62174288,62174288,src/wallet/wallet.cpp
MarcoFalke,2016-06-03T16:02:52Z,Nit: empty arg.\nNit: Missing comment mentioning that `min_relay_tx_fee=1000` is used.\n\n(Comments help to identify the issue when something breaks)\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7967#discussion_r65732540,65732540,qa/rpc-tests/fundrawtransaction.py
MarcoFalke,2016-06-03T16:02:55Z,"the default is not ""estimate"" but whatever happens to be set by the user on startup or after startup.\n\nEither make it `default 0` or `default not set`.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7967#discussion_r65732549,65732549,src/wallet/rpcwallet.cpp
