ryanofsky,2019-03-11T20:40:52Z,"In commit ""wallet: Add WalletLocation utility class"" (b35a71827bddf534816f1c5fda83c8e33a18eb63)\n\nThis does not appear to have been cherry-picked from 01a4c095c87500650663341533f000c6b613e9da correctly. The original commit is not adding any `ListWalletDir` function, so it is unclear where this is coming from. Also the function is being added without being called in this or later commits.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15575#discussion_r264420190,264420190,src/wallet/walletutil.cpp
