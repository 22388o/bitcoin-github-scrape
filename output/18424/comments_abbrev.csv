hebasto,2020-03-25 21:34:48,"@Empact \n> Perhaps also `BitcoinApplication#window`?\n\nUnfortunately, this is impossible due to [`QMainWindow`](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qmainwindow.html#QMainWindow) expects a parent of the `QWidget` type. And the `BitcoinApplication` class is not derived from the `QWidget`.\n\nI'd suggest to remove the `window` from the members of `BitcoinApplication` class.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18424#issuecomment-604100021,604100021,
