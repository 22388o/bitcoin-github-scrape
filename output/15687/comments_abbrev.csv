jonatack,2019-07-08T10:10:33Z,Thanks for the review @laanwj and @MarcoFalke. I've pushed rebased commits that address your feedback. Are you able to rereview/retest?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15687#issuecomment-509165722,509165722,

MarcoFalke,2019-03-28T20:52:32Z,"nit: instead of logging the timestamps and whether they changed, you might use `assert_equal` (or explicitly comment it out, if it currently fails)",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15687#discussion_r270194549,270194549,test/functional/tool_wallet.py

jonatack,2019-04-02T14:59:30Z,"Thanks for reviewing! I added both logs and assertions with the logs serving as a sanity check for the assertions.

laanwj,2019-06-17T13:44:37Z,"I understand surrounding the `info` methods, but what is the logic here? creating a wallet that already exists should leave it untouched?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15687#discussion_r294304432,294304432,test/functional/tool_wallet.py
MarcoFalke,2019-06-24T17:55:21Z,"style-nit: Could be a ""const"" member, set in the first line of `run_test`?\n\n```py\nself.wallet_path = os.path.join(...",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15687#discussion_r296843161,296843161,test/functional/tool_wallet.py
MarcoFalke,2019-06-24T18:02:16Z,style-nit: Is it required to log the timestamp in a simple getter method? I'd prefer if it was logged by the caller or just asserted (Looks like you already do both of that),https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15687#discussion_r296846078,296846078,test/functional/tool_wallet.py

MarcoFalke,2019-06-24T18:05:18Z,This looks like a test-dev debug statement. Maybe use `self.log.debug`?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15687#discussion_r296847292,296847292,test/functional/tool_wallet.py
MarcoFalke,2019-06-24T18:08:41Z,"Looks like you are overwriting a previous symbol with the same name. I think it is clearer to split the tests into smaller ones, so that overwriting does not happen.
