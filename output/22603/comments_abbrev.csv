flack,2021-08-02 14:51:51,"yes, but by the time they notice, a new json might already have been created with some new entries, and then you'd have to merge it somehow (or lose the new entries). Not a huge deal I guess, but it couldn't hurt to spell out that scenario in the release notes. At least then you'll have something to point to if someone opens a bug report about how their banlist is gone :-). ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22603#issuecomment-891090639,891090639,
