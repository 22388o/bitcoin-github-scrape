jonatack,2019-08-15 23:49:04,Simplified the PR. Two of the Travis builds timed out; the others are green and this commit doesn't change anything that would fail.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16622#issuecomment-521835808,521835808,

fanquake,2019-08-16 01:21:52,"I don't think we need the extra comment here. That string is in the arg description, and none of the other `AC_ARG_WITH` instances have comments.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16622#discussion_r314555164,314555164,configure.ac
jonatack,2019-08-16 09:48:39,"Thanks for reviewing. I saw that L247 (AC_ARG_WITH for sanitizers) has a comment as well as some of the AC_ARG_ENABLES. That said, ARG_WITH would normally be about building with a package, not enabling features, so L247 may not be a good example to follow. I'll remove and force push.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16622#discussion_r314654269,314654269,configure.ac
