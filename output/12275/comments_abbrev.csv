ryanofsky,2018-01-26T15:15:21Z,"I was originally going to follow up on this change by making RescanFromTime rescan any missed blocks if a scan stopped early because of a reorg (8add443be1c4b82f75d0eca4763fc928b8dbcf08), but I don't think this should be needed because notifications from the reorg should scan all the relevant blocks.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12275#issuecomment-360811532,360811532,
