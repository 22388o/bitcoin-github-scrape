And there is still value in compiling with Wshadow periodically (with a carefully chosen compiler) and seeing if it finds any bug.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10136#issuecomment-290967680,290967680,
paveljanik,2017-04-02T06:32:10Z,"Postmerge ACK. The real problem is that people use ancient compilers and I have not tested them all (only few selected by some distros as their default compilers).\n\nFWIW: I'll compile all my builds with `-Wshadow` to catch all new occurrences. And of course, thanks for patience :-)",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10136#issuecomment-290967839,290967839,
