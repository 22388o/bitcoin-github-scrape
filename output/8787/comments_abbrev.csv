luke-jr,2016-09-22T03:23:13Z,configure comes with the source code packages. You should not be using git unless you are a developer.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8787#issuecomment-248801096,248801096,
laanwj,2016-09-22T03:25:28Z,But in practice most people following this guide seem to be cloning from git. No one uses the source tarball. It's mostly developers that follow this guide in the first place. Also IIRC we mention `autogen.sh` in all other places (such as build-unix.md).\n\nIt could ofc. be added that it is optional.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8787#issuecomment-248801367,248801367,
AmirAbrams,2016-09-22T03:42:12Z,"@luke-jr I always build from git but I am a developer and thought the document was intended for developers.  If not, then please close my PR but like @laanwj points out, build-osx.md and build-unix.md reference the autogen.sh step.  Maybe I can add an `if/fi` that checks for the configure file or explain the example is for source code packages?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8787#issuecomment-248803372,248803372,
laanwj,2016-09-22T03:46:16Z,"> Maybe I can add an if/fi that checks for the configure file or explain the example is for source code packages?\n\nMaybe just add a comment after it `# not required when building from tarball`. Adding a fi/if construction sounds like overkill, and anyhow this is based on information only the user can know.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8787#issuecomment-248803805,248803805,
