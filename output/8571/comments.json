Perhaps this discussion is premature - I do foresee a future where we might want to make better use of pruned nodes though. Can I go ahead and develop a pull request that allows pruned nodes to be entered into the address database but marks them as pruned?\n",

Firstly, it displays the version message prior to any disconnection logic. Secondly, it disconnects when an outgoing connection discovers irrelevant (rather than unexpected) services, as I believe was the intention, using the nRelevantServices variable as this is designed for. It also logs when a node provides unexpected services, but as long as those unexpected services are still relevant, it does not disconnect - as I can't imagine we would want this - for example, just because you get a cherry on top of your cake doesn't mean you will want to throw away the cake.\r\n\r\nI hope the logic behind this is clear, but if not, please ask/comment/etc.\r\n",

    "body": "NACK. This will prevent segwit nodes from ever connecting to non-segwit nodes, making a petitioning more likely.\n\nnRelevantServices is called that way because they're relevant. It is not called nRequiredServices.\n\nThe reasoning is as follows: when selecting a peer to connect to, we pick based on their assumed services. Then we set the CNode::nServicesExpected based on that knowledge intersected with nRelevantServices. When the node later does not turn out to have all the flags in nServicesExpected, we disconnect, because apparently we did not connect to the node with the properties they claimed to have. This lets us move the decision criteria to the selection loop, rather than decide ad-hoc after connecting.\n",
