gmaxwell,2012-09-19T05:06:50Z,"NAK. This potentially breaks the bitcoin distributed algorithm.\n\n(Ignore checkpoints for a moment.)  I mine a long fork with 300,000 diff1 blocks. I feed it to you.  You'll now never fetch the much longer real chain from honest nodes.   Same problem exists later in the chain too, it's just not trivial to pull off as an attack in that case. May also have some weird effects with forks around the r",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1834#issuecomment-8679441,8679441,
jgarzik,2012-09-19T05:29:07Z,"That case is nigh impossible given checkpoints.  You ask to ignore this, to present a theoretical case that does not therefore apply to real world client releases.\n\nOne case _obviously_ can lead to stuck downloads today.  The client sends getblocks to a remote peer that we know in advance does not have the data we need.  nAskedForBlocks is incremented, preventing further queries, directly and im",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1834#issuecomment-8679752,8679752,
laanwj,2012-09-19T05:43:11Z,"It does seem a bit dangerous to rely on pfrom->nStartingHeight so completely. It's very hard to see what effect this will have in edge cases.\n\nCouldn't we address the ""stuck downloads"" problem in another place, ie by detecting stuck downloads actively and requesting from different nodes. After all, even if a node claims to have more blocks, it can still be stuck.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1834#issuecomment-8679910,8679910,
gmaxwell,2012-09-19T05:50:12Z,"@jgarzik the download happily continues when we get another block from the network in an average of 10 minutes.\n\nI presented the toy example ignoring checkpoints because its easier to understand.  The same exposure exists at retargets where a forks can be created that differ in difficulty by a factor of two, or if a non-majority but high hashpower (e.g. asics before they are widely adopted) atta",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1834#issuecomment-8679990,8679990,
