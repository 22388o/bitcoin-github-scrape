    "body": "NAK. This potentially breaks the bitcoin distributed algorithm.\n\n(Ignore checkpoints for a moment.)  I mine a long fork with 300,000 diff1 blocks. I feed it to you.  You'll now never fetch the much longer real chain from honest nodes.   Same problem exists later in the chain too, it's just not trivial to pull off as an attack in that case. May also have some weird effects with forks around the retarget (you can have short competing forks with different difficulties, and because the maximum retarget change is >=2x a lower diff chain could have more blocks, even for a fork only a few blocks long)\n",

The same exposure exists at retargets where a forks can be created that differ in difficulty by a factor of two, or if a non-majority but high hashpower (e.g. asics before they are widely adopted) attacker used timewarp to mine a fork down to low difficulty starting anywhere after the highest checkpoint.\n\nI don't think the exposure, even if it is fringe and unexciting is worth avoiding waiting for a block in the rare case that you get a peer which is stuck and behind the chain.\n",
