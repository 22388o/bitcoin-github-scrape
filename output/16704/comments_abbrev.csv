MarcoFalke,2019-08-23 20:52:18,"Why would you want to historically check for versionbits warnings, when we assume that signatures in the chain are valid?\n\n```suggestion\n               ((ComputeBlockVersion(pindex->pprev, params) >> bit) & 1) == 0 &&\n               !IsInAssumedValidChain(pindex, params);\n```",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16704#discussion_r317297853,317297853,src/validation.cpp
achow101,2019-08-24 05:06:02,"That feels less robust to me. assumevalid is something that users can change, so if a user were to change assumevalid to something else (e.g. so they could fully validate signatures too), then the warning would appear for them. Also, I don't think that would work on regtest, but I suppose it's really only a problem there if you are trying to test warnings.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16704#discussion_r317345207,317345207,src/validation.cpp
