gmaxwell,2012-08-22T14:20:07Z,Should we do something useful with mlock failure? At least log something?\n\nI wonder how much of a lost cause this isâ€” as the encryption key gets handled by json or the GUI...\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1699#issuecomment-7935633,7935633,
laanwj,2012-08-22T14:28:02Z,"Re: mlock failure, maybe log a warning once, to prevent logspam. \n\nI don't agree this is a lost cause. Even though it's not water tight yet in the case of wallet encryption, it is a move in the right direction. \n\nIt does protect the wallet private keys in the case someone has the wallet on an encrypted volume or an USB stick, but hasn't encrypted swap... \n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1699#issuecomment-7935888,7935888,
gmaxwell,2012-08-22T15:03:35Z,Log once is better than not at all. Logspam would be bad too.  Perhaps just log stats on shutdown? \n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1699#issuecomment-7937139,7937139,
