I don't care want goes there, but I propose using the result of estimatefee(4) with a significantly longer time decay over the last few months.  I'll post the result of that once calculated.\n\nThis is meant for 0.12 backport\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7296#issuecomment-169088519,169088519,
morcos,2016-01-05T21:10:53Z,"@MarcoFalke ugh.. thanks.  more than just that one fail.  These are probably things that should be fixed b/c the travis tests that fail are implicitly depending on estimatefee returning minrelaytxfee, which isn't a good assumption.  I'm working on it\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7296#issuecomment-169134974,169134974,

laanwj,2016-01-07T08:04:46Z,"Concept ACK.\n\nOne nit: this adds yet another `-XXXfee` parameter.\nAlthough it makes sense, for the wallet we already have `-mintxfee`, `-paytxfee`, `-maxtxfee` this wild growth of options does get a bit confusing for users, I think.\nBut I don't know a better solution either.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7296#issuecomment-169590729,169590729,
