fanquake,2015-06-11T04:53:51Z,"Concept ACK. Definite improvement over the someone pastes a URL in IRC and everyone fetches it method. \n\nNow that you've removed Gavin from the doc, does that mean that the key is held by multiple people? Do we assume the signer is whoever commits the sig to the repo?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6269#issuecomment-110998417,110998417,

Still need to figure a way to do threshold signing, or multisig. so there is no central point of failure there.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6269#issuecomment-111397384,111397384,
luke-jr,2015-06-15T00:14:46Z,How does this interact with other signers? Will a central key be available for use to sign releases outside bitcoin/bitcoin?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6269#issuecomment-111891069,111891069,
laanwj,2015-06-15T07:42:46Z,@luke-jr This just changes how the signatures are distributed (and integrated)\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6269#issuecomment-111968834,111968834,
theuni,2015-06-15T17:50:09Z,"Yes, this was just a change in how the signatures are fetched to make things easier for gitian builders. Now there's no need to look around on irc/mail for a link to a sig, the descriptor knows where to look and can use it as soon as it's been committed.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6269#issuecomment-112151885,112151885,
