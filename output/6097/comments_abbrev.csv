jonasschnelli,2015-05-08T08:25:18Z,The benefits of this pull is not just another type of structure instead it's a clean distinction between test classes/files and utility classes/files.\nAt the moment you can't distinguish between a runnable test and a utility class within the folder `./qa/rpc-tests`. Since #5981 it's even more mixed up. It's hard to get a overview of all possible test we have (thats why i extended `rpc-test.sh`).\,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6097#issuecomment-100150928,100150928,
sdaftuar,2015-05-14T18:41:51Z,"Concept ACK.  I agree that the rpc-tests directory is a bit messy, and I have found it difficult in the past to just find all the tests that I can run.  Making `rpc-tests.sh` be a canonical place to put new scripts so others know to run them seems like a helpful thing which I plan to use.\n\nI don't have much opinion about how to best organize python code, but what you have done with the test_fram",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6097#issuecomment-102131937,102131937,

laanwj,2015-05-21T09:08:43Z,"It seems you forgot to update `rpcbind_test.py` for the new `python-bitcoinrpc` path.\n\nSpeaking of which - let's move the `bitcoinrpc` directory directly into `rpc-tests` so that the `Add python-bitcoinrpc to module search path` hackery (in four places!) is no longer needed and we can just do:\n\n```\nfrom bitcoinrpc.authproxy import AuthServiceProxy, JSONRPCException\n```\n\n... directly\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6097#issuecomment-104188555,104188555,
jonasschnelli,2015-05-21T19:26:11Z,Totally agreed.\nI just remove the `python-bitcoinrpc` completely and placed the `authproxy.py` file directly into the new `test-framework` folder (it's not a submodule so it can be treated as normal utility class).\nAlso fixed the `rpcbind_test.py` as mentioned by @laanwj\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6097#issuecomment-104394693,104394693,
