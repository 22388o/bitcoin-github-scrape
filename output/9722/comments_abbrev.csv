CryptAxe,2017-02-09T18:01:25Z,"Making another update, but in the meantime, I changed the warning message because if there is confusion even here then it needs to be more clear.  I also updated the message box code so that it isn't using an obsolete constructor and removed the extra escape.\n\nThis warning will only be displayed for addresses which are used after the software has been updated.

jonasschnelli,2017-02-10T08:32:37Z,"Code looks good to me. I dislike the `""1""`, but I guess this is just how we have to do it with the flexible per wtx map.\n\nThough I'm unsure about the update path of this feature. If we only mark new destinations, this may result in a false awareness of address reuse because some addresses you may reuse (the old ones before the upgrade) won't show the warning and users may think it's okay to re",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9722#issuecomment-278886481,278886481,
