jnewbery,2018-09-25T15:33:35Z,Could probably do with a comment here to explain why you're doing this (removing `<test_name>.py` and `<test_name>.py --arg` from the test list),https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14316#discussion_r220243578,220243578,test/functional/test_runner.py
MarcoFalke,2018-09-25T17:28:02Z,"nit: could remove the use of the `re` module, since it is no longer required? `""foo.py"".split('.py')[0] == ""foo"".split('.py')[0]`",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14316#discussion_r220283849,220283849,test/functional/test_runner.py
jimmysong,2018-09-27T00:03:23Z,nit: I prefer `test.strip('.py')` just in case there's a very unlikely '.py' in the middle of a file name.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14316#discussion_r220759531,220759531,test/functional/test_runner.py
jimmysong,2018-09-27T00:04:18Z,nit: same as above. `test.strip('.py')` is preferable over `test.split('.py')[0]` and reads a little better.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14316#discussion_r220759654,220759654,test/functional/test_runner.py
