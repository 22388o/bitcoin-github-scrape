laanwj,2015-04-08T06:26:31Z,@jgarzik Thanks for testing\n\n@TheBlueMatt can you take a look? It looks like we'll have to change some assumptions in the comparson tool.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5966#issuecomment-90818904,90818904,
jtimon,2015-04-20T13:49:11Z,Here's a version rebased on top of #5968 and adding so more consensus params to avoid that ContextualCheckBlockHeader has to have a new couple of lines every time that a softfork gets old enough to enforce it by height rather than voting:\n\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/compare/master...jtimon:bip34_switchover?expand=1\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5966#issuecomment-94455952,94455952,
luke-jr,2015-06-02T02:23:07Z,"Minor bug*: If the blockchain were reorganised off the switchover block, we would be breaking consensus here. I wonder if it might be good to abstract #5927 so its logic is reusable for things like this. That is, instead of ""when do we enforce BIP34?"", we ask ""what blocks are permitted to skip BIP34 validation?""\n\n\* This is only a bug when checkpoints are disabled or #5927 is merged.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5966#issuecomment-107774473,107774473,
