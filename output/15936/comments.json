    "body": "Thanks for the testing! In summary, I think all behavior described is expected (and improves on current behavior, even if could be improved more later).\r\n\r\n> 1. `bitcoin-qt` had prune option unchecked in GUI. Relaunched `bitcoin-qt` with a data directory that has pruned node. Everything works fine and it automatically checked the prune option. Although GB mentioned in GUI was incorrect. I had saved prune=1024 in `bitcoin.conf` and GUI had 2 GB.\r\n\r\nThe GUI prune setting is a whole number of GB so it's easier to change and understand than if it were MiB, and to avoid mistakes editing large numbers. 1024MiB is rounded up to 2GB in the display, even though 1024MiB should still be the effective pruning size until the user changes it again. The idea behind rounding up is that it would be bad if node used more disk space than the displayed amount, but ok if it's using less space than the displayed amount.\r\n\r\n> 2. `bitcoin-qt` had prune option checked in GUI from 1. Used data directory that has all blocks saved on disk. Everything works fine and it automatically unchecked the prune option in GUI.\r\n\r\nNice test. It's good to have confirmation that `bitcoin.conf` still takes precedence over `QSettings` so upgrading does not cause changed settings to be used. (Implementation note: the precedence for settings sources is `settings.json` > `bitcoin.conf` > `QSettings`)\r\n\r\n> 3. I wanted to check what happens if qt and bitcoin.conf are different. Restarted `bitcoin-qt` with data directory used in 1. Unchecked the prune option manually in GUI. This saved `\"prune\": 0` in `settings.json`. While `bitcoin.conf` for 1 still has `prune=1024`, started bitcoin-qt and I see this error: [Do you want to rebuild the block database now?]\r\n\r\nIdeally this would be shown as a question not an error, but the benefit of this PR is that when you uncheck the pruning option it now actually disables pruning. Disabling pruning does require reindexing, which is why it asks to reindex.\r\n\r\nSpeaking more generally, the idea behind settings precedence is that `settings.json` is intended to hold live, dynamic settings chosen by the user, and `bitcoin.conf` is supposed to hold static settings chosen by the packager or installer (who can disable live settings with `nosettings=1`). The cases where different settings sources provide different values are intended to be well defined, but also rare. There should be few use cases that require controlling the same setting from different places. In the most common cases, GUI users should not need any `bitcoin.conf` file at all. GUI users should have better options than creating a text file, learning a configuration syntax, and restarting their node to apply settings. Also, ideally more settings will be able to be applied live without restarts, and there will be a `config` RPC method to get and set arbitrary `settings.json` settings.\r\n\r\n> 4. Saved below things in `settings.json` for non-pruned node:\r\n>    ```\r\n>    {\r\n>        \"prune\": 1024,\r\n>        \"wallet\": [\r\n>        ]\r\n>       }\r\n>    ```\r\n>\r\n>    `bitcoin.conf` had `txindex=1`\r\n> \r\n> and this is the error I get: [Prune mode is incompatible with -txindex]\r\n\r\nThis is another good test, and I think it is straightforward that if you enable pruning and enable txindex you will see this error. Ideally this could show options for disabling pruning or disabling txindex, though.\r\n\r\n> 5. There is one more case which I wanted to reproduce but couldn't and also don't want to risk deleting my blocks for non-pruned node which is explained in [Pruning should be based on bitcoin.conf\u00a0bitcoin-core/gui#245](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/issues/245)\r\n\r\nI don't think there should be any direct interaction between this PR and what's described in [#245](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/issues/245). With this PR the node will still prune if you enable pruning in the GUI, and still not prune if you disable pruning in the GUI. The other issue [#245](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/issues/245) seems like it is requesting that the node avoids pruning even if pruning was requested, which does not make sense to me even though I agree we should have safeguards to prevent pruning from happening unintentionally. If you can describe in more detail how [#245](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/issues/245) happened (how pruning got enabled in the GUI), maybe we could add some safeguard to prevent this.",
