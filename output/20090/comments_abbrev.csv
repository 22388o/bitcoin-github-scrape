amitiuttarwar,2020-10-09 23:13:34,"hmm, good point! \n\nhistory: Marco suggested extracting in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19725#discussion_r470944955. I thought a benefit was to keep `CONNECTION_TYPE_DOC` next to `ConnectionType` definition for future updates, but now we don't have that regardless. I've moved into `src/rpc/net.cpp` and added a comment on the `ConnectionType` enum for future code changes. ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20090#discussion_r502708194,502708194,src/net.h
