        "patch": "@@ -0,0 +1,102 @@\n+Bitcoin Core version 0.14.2 is now available from:\n+\n+  <https://bitcoin.org/bin/bitcoin-core-0.14.2/>\n+\n+This is a new minor version release, including various bugfixes and\n+performance improvements, as well as updated translations.\n+\n+Please report bugs using the issue tracker at github:\n+\n+  <https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues>\n+\n+To receive security and update notifications, please subscribe to:\n+\n+  <https://bitcoincore.org/en/list/announcements/join/>\n+\n+Compatibility\n+==============\n+\n+Bitcoin Core is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using\n+the Linux kernel, macOS 10.8+, and Windows Vista and later.\n+\n+Microsoft ended support for Windows XP on [April 8th, 2014](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/end-of-xp-support),\n+No attempt is made to prevent installing or running the software on Windows XP, you\n+can still do so at your own risk but be aware that there are known instabilities and issues.\n+Please do not report issues about Windows XP to the issue tracker.\n+\n+Bitcoin Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not\n+frequently tested on them.\n+\n+Notable changes\n+===============\n+\n+miniupnp CVE-2017-8798\n+----------------------------\n+\n+Bundled miniupnpc was updated to 2.0.20170509. This fixes an integer signedness error\n+(present in MiniUPnPc v1.4.20101221 through v2.0) that allows remote attackers\n+(within the LAN) to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified\n+other impact.\n+\n+This only affects users that have explicitly enabled UPnP through the GUI\n+setting or through the `-upnp` option, as since the last UPnP vulnerability\n+(in Bitcoin Core 0.10.3) it has been disabled by default.\n+\n+If you use this option, it is recommended to upgrade to this version as soon as\n+possible.\n+\n+Known Bugs\n+==========\n+\n+Since 0.14.0 the approximate transaction fee shown in Bitcoin-Qt when using coin\n+control and smart fee estimation does not reflect any change in target from the\n+smart fee slider. It will only present an approximate fee calculated using the\n+default target. The fee calculated using the correct target is still applied to\n+the transaction and shown in the final send confirmation dialog.\n+\n+0.14.2 Change log\n+=================\n+\n+Detailed release notes follow. This overview includes changes that affect\n+behavior, not code moves, refactors and string updates. For convenience in locating\n+the code changes and accompanying discussion, both the pull request and\n+git merge commit are mentioned.\n+\n+### RPC and other APIs\n+- #10410 `321419b` Fix importwallet edge case rescan bug (ryanofsky)\n+\n+### P2P protocol and network code\n+- #10424 `37a8fc5` Populate services in GetLocalAddress (morcos)\n+- #10441 `9e3ad50` Only enforce expected services for half of outgoing connections (theuni)\n+\n+### Build system\n+- #10414 `ffb0c4b` miniupnpc 2.0.20170509 (fanquake)\n+- #10228 `ae479bc` Regenerate bitcoin-config.h as necessary (theuni)\n+\n+### Miscellaneous\n+- #10245 `44a17f2` Minor fix in build documentation for FreeBSD 11 (shigeya)\n+- #10215 `0aee4a1` Check interruptNet during dnsseed lookups (TheBlueMatt)\n+\n+### GUI\n+- #10231 `1e936d7` Reduce a significant cs_main lock freeze (jonasschnelli)\n+\n+### Wallet\n+- #10294 `1847642` Unset change position when there is no change (instagibbs)\n+\n+Credits\n+=======\n+\n+Thanks to everyone who directly contributed to this release:\n+\n+- Alex Morcos\n+- Cory Fields\n+- fanquake\n+- Gregory Sanders\n+- Jonas Schnelli\n+- Matt Corallo\n+- Russell Yanofsky\n+- Shigeya Suzuki\n+- Wladimir J. van der Laan\n+\n+As well as everyone that helped translating on [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/bitcoin/).\n+"
