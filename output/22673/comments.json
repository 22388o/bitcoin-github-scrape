Instead, you could add it to `WalletClient` (have `WalletClient` also parse the `-fallbackfee` option) and retrieve it from there via `NodeContext`. When wallets are disabled, `NodeContext.wallet_client` will just be nullptr, and in that situation, `-fallbackfee` couldn't have been set and so doesn't matter for the fee estimation.",

For example, it was discussed in November 2020 to soft-replace the settxfee and estimatesmartfee calls with sat/vB equivalents named setfeerate (#20391) and estimatefeerate; the BTC/kvB ones would become hidden RPCs to not break user space.\r\n\r\nSo, if we do add another fee rate RPC, consider making it denominated in sat/vB units and referring to \"fee rates\", rather than \"fees\".\r\n",
