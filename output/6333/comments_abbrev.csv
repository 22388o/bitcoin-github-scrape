This isn't surprising as last update was more than a year ago.\n\nNote that only nodes on port 8333 are included in the built-in seeds. This is part of the regexp in `makeseeds.py`.

We went from a separate table for IPv4 and IPv6+onion to a unified one, let's not split it up again (for - at most - 10% saving).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6333#issuecomment-115284498,115284498,

PRabahy,2015-06-25T22:03:33Z,I think I figured out what is going on with my nodes. I have both IP4 and IP6 setup on my machine and I have a publicly accessible IP6 address. When bitcoin starts up it appears to only autodetect IP6 addresses. The problem with this is that I never setup IP6 port forwarding on my router (IP4 is forwarded properly). I'm going to open the IP6 port and see if that changes the statistics at all.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6333#issuecomment-115413905,115413905,
