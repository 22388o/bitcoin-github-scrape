I have verified that this node is open and accessible using https://getaddr.bitnodes.io/.\n\nAlso, my node at 68.34.102.231:8333 only shows 34% uptime for 30 days and I believe that I have had closer to ~60-70% uptime. Overall I don't believe that this hurts the overall intent of this PR, but something just seems a bit off.\n\nEdit: Node in second paragraph was supposed to say port 8333\n",
