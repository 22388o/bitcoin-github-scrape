laanwj,2015-03-26T07:04:03Z,"> (int)std::max(ui->sliderSmartFee->minimum(), std::min(ui->sliderSmartFee->maximum(), ui->sliderSmartFee->value()\n\nDoes the slider guarantee this value range for its value, making this redundant?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5932#discussion_r27191925,27191925,src/qt/sendcoinsdialog.cpp
Diapolo,2015-04-08T12:36:56Z,"<pre>\nWhen setting this property, the minimum is adjusted if necessary to ensure that the range remains valid. Also the slider's current value is adjusted to be within the new range.\n</pre>\n\n\nSeems like this IS the case...\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5932#discussion_r27964976,27964976,src/qt/sendcoinsdialog.cpp
Diapolo,2015-04-08T13:08:49Z,"@laanwj So this would become `int nBlocksToConfirm = defaultConfirmTarget - ui->sliderSmartFee->value();`, right?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5932#discussion_r27967388,27967388,src/qt/sendcoinsdialog.cpp
