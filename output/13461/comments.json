In general, account balance calculation is not considered reliable and has resulted in confusing outcomes, so it is recommended to avoid passing this argument.'\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the API to allow `getbalance include_watchonly=true`, which will now also call `GetLegacyAddress()`. I'm not sure if that's desirable. At the very least, the help text should make it clear that the balance may not be as expected.\r\n\r\ncc @ryanofsky , who wrote that help text.",

It should just be matter of forwarding the arguments down to `CWalletTx::GetAvailableCredit` and adding a few lines of filtering code there. This would probably be less confusing that calculating the balance in a different way when filters are present (and having to explain this in documentation and maybe break compatibility in the future).",
