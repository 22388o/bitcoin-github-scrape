jnewbery,2017-09-19T18:05:10Z,concept ACK. I think this is especially helpful for new contributors to the project.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11369#issuecomment-330622962,330622962,
theuni,2017-09-19T19:45:32Z,"mmm, I like the idea, but I don't agree with annotating each lock with a comment. They will eventually go stale and be misleading or completely wrong.\n\nInstead, I'd rather annotate everything with GUARDED_BY (ala #11226), so that it's easy to see what things a mutex protects, as well as having it enforceable via static analysis.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11369#issuecomment-330652456,330652456,
practicalswift,2017-09-19T21:24:06Z,"@theuni You have a point regarding the risk for staleness unless we are careful to keep them up-to-date. If there is any interest I can commit to keeping these comments up-to-date - including removing no longer needed locks (due to refactoring, etc.).\n\nFWIW, I have written a script that generates these comments automatically by using the `GUARDED_BY` annotations added in #11226.

jonasschnelli,2017-09-22T05:36:43Z,Seems NACKish to me. Will quickly run out of date and – if you ask me – you should follow/read the code to understand the lock rather then trusting a comment.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11369#issuecomment-331354688,331354688,
MarcoFalke,2017-09-22T09:15:09Z,"Agree with Cory. We might not need those annotations after #11226 is merged, as that pull already serves as documentation.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11369#issuecomment-331395534,331395534,
fanquake,2017-09-25T01:41:25Z,"Needs a rebase, but going to close this in favour of #11226. Seems like this sort of change could end up with a similar situation to what happened after enabling -Wshadow. Also seems like the EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED and GUARDED_BY will work better as documentation themselves. @laanwj Any thoughts?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11369#issuecomment-331756739,331756739,
laanwj,2017-09-28T08:22:50Z,"@fanquake I agree, annotations that can be checked/enforced by the compiler\nare preferable.
