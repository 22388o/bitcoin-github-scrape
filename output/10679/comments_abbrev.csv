gmaxwell,2017-06-30T19:02:46Z,I think I would just call it negative.  It's perfectly valid to encode negative numbers in DER but they don't make sense in signatures-- so for some inexplicable reason OpenSSL just ignored the sign.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10679#issuecomment-312348788,312348788,
schildbach,2017-06-30T19:31:58Z,"Thanks, I changed the wording and added a reference to BIP66. What I don't understand is why this test is in tx_valid.json and not in tx_invalid.json. BIP66 declares such sigs as invalid. Or do the tests run pre-BIP66?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10679#issuecomment-312354746,312354746,
sipa,2017-06-30T19:50:06Z,"Each test specifies its own flags. If nothing is specified, the flags are 0, I believe. So no BIP66 rules in this test.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10679#issuecomment-312358358,312358358,
