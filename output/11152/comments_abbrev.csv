The mempool being full and/or spammed is not nearly as problematic thanks to a lot of improvements, and not to mention significantly more expensive to do so.

sdaftuar,2017-08-26T02:24:53Z,"@RHavar  I think the main lens through which I look at this is whether this is better for miners or not.  The downside to increasing the limits is a slowdown in mempool operations and, specifically, CreateNewBlock.  Quantifying that slowdown should be part of any argument in favor of raising it, along with motivation for miner income going up to compensate for that.\n\nEven putting aside argumen",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11152#issuecomment-325074903,325074903,
