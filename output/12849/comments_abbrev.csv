MarcoFalke,2018-04-03T17:01:45Z,utACK 8dd547d82b70678c19bee110950d962d4e62ed5a. Seems like a tiny improvement over what it was before.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12849#issuecomment-378322804,378322804,
MarcoFalke,2018-03-31T14:37:15Z,I'd slightly prefer if the comments in the loops down there were transformed into debug statements. (Where we check for `i == ...` and `j == ...`),https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12849#discussion_r178433299,178433299,test/functional/p2p_sendheaders.py
MarcoFalke,2018-03-31T16:11:55Z,What I meant was to transfer those comments from `# ...` to `self.log.debug(...`,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12849#discussion_r178435553,178435553,test/functional/p2p_sendheaders.py
