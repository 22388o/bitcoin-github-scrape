vasild,2021-10-06 16:08:28,Took the doc suggestions. Left the comment in `net.cpp`. This should really be `static` function in `net.cpp` (in which case the comment belongs to `net.cpp`). The only reason it is not is that we need to make it a friend of `CService` (in `netaddress.h`). It is not a public/exported function for everybody to use and as such does not have a declaration in `net.h`.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23077#discussion_r723441491,723441491,src/net.cpp
