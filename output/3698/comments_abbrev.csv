Diapolo,2014-02-19T14:11:33Z,@laanwj I had this in my local branch but not pushed :). I also ensured that ordering matches tab ordering (so the diff is mostly a move in optionsmodel.cpp).\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3698#issuecomment-35502045,35502045,
laanwj,2014-03-27T10:19:28Z,Needs rebase after #3619 due to reordering of command line help\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3698#issuecomment-38786699,38786699,

laanwj,2014-02-19T11:40:55Z,"I prefer not defining this and just using boost::thread::hardware_concurrency() where appropriate. No magic number is hardcoded here, we're just replacing the boost name with a name our own. Also this is not a constant, and not a maximum (you can use more threads than this, it likely won't help you much, but you can).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3698#discussion_r9862011,9862011,src/main.h
Diapolo,2014-02-19T13:42:26Z,"I changed it back, also the number of HW threads is just used to limit the negative number you can input to ""leave cores free"".\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3698#discussion_r9864652,9864652,src/main.h
laanwj,2014-02-19T13:48:09Z,"~~I don't think having 0 as maximum is useful :) Probably best to set no maximum, if we want to manually control the number of verification threads, there is no upper limit.~~\nnever mind, misread\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3698#discussion_r9864810,9864810,src/qt/optionsdialog.cpp
