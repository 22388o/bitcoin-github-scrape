laanwj,2019-09-10 12:02:42,"As the method is defined there, shouldn't this documentation be in the `.h` file? (same for `CChainState::ActivateBestChain` below)",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16757#discussion_r322702003,322702003,src/validation.cpp
MarcoFalke,2019-09-10 12:38:43,`ActivateBestChainStep` is marked `private` and was never meant to be exposed in the header. I think it makes sense to keep the documentation close to the function implementation,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16757#discussion_r322717307,322717307,src/validation.cpp
MarcoFalke,2019-09-10 12:50:38,"Good point for the `public` method, though. So I fixed this for ABC only",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16757#discussion_r322723093,322723093,src/validation.cpp
