hebasto,2021-04-15 16:17:55,"> The pro file is a bit outdated.

jarolrod,2021-04-15 16:23:25,"@hebasto yeah you can open up UI files individually. This pro file opens up all of them for you as well as the resources folder. I think it's more convenient to have all of them open. I don't have a strong opinion on this\n\nIt could be that no one uses it (i dont) and it could be wasting time to maintain this.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21695#issuecomment-820560606,820560606,
