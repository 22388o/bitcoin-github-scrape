Diapolo,2013-08-22T05:57:46Z,"That slot is connected in `WalletView::setWalletModel()`, which covers the walletModel check and `WalletView::setClientModel()` covers the clientModel check.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2872#discussion_r5917072,5917072,src/qt/walletview.cpp
laanwj,2013-08-22T13:50:40Z,"You're correct. Although I don't think the slot gets disconnected when a NULL model would be set later on, so it's not completely impossible to reach here with model being NULL.\n\nIf there's anything I've learned in years of writing C++ code it's that there is no such thing as too many NULL pointer checks. Better to be safe than sorry, please just keep it :)\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2872#discussion_r5924180,5924180,src/qt/walletview.cpp
