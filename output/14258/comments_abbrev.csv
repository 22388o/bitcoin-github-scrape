promag,2018-09-19T17:51:57Z,IMO leaving unused code that can lead to bugs is worst than code churn. This can be reverted along with proper review/testing once and if necessary.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14258#issuecomment-422897810,422897810,

decorumvelox,2018-09-20T02:46:18Z,utACK 0172ba4a6800ac934f8b4712c27b5ccd66deb658. It is safer to remove this unused code now. Any future optimizations should be written in a different way that is more clear and not easily misunderstood as benign.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14258#issuecomment-423022140,423022140,
