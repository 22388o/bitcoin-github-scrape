gmaxwell,2017-05-07T01:05:31Z,"Why trash privacy, create additional CPU attack vectors, dos attack vectors for the client, etc. to save at most 26kbit/sec?  It doesn't seem like a useful tradeoff.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10350#issuecomment-299675475,299675475,
CodeShark,2017-05-07T01:08:18Z,Bandwidth isn't the main concern. Code complexity is. It's only intended to be a very short-term solution until we can introduce clientside block filtering.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10350#issuecomment-299675556,299675556,
CodeShark,2017-05-07T01:10:51Z,I should add that using BIP37 with untrusted nodes is already quite insecure.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10350#issuecomment-299675619,299675619,

TheBlueMatt,2017-05-07T01:48:08Z,"@CodeShark testnet is for testing Bitcoin, I dont generally consider it a target for features? As you point out this is a rather simple patch, if some alts have a need for it, they can easily take and maintain this patch.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10350#issuecomment-299676778,299676778,
CodeShark,2017-05-08T03:25:12Z,"My entire stack currently relies on BIP37 for synching with a node, including a number of testing tools I use. The alternatives of either maintaining a custom server (one more thick dependency) or using RPC (excruciatingly and impractically slow and inefficient) aren't really options for me at this point. So until we do something like clientside block filtering I'm left with either using this patc",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10350#issuecomment-299764221,299764221,
