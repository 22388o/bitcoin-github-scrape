theuni,2017-07-31T15:43:30Z,"Yea, I like this!\n\nMy only concern is that the annotations are infectious, so this may cause us to have to add them while doing large refactors where one annotation already exists.

practicalswift,2017-08-01T15:07:42Z,@TheBlueMatt Yes it appears to fail before hitting expected annotation-missing failure. I'm not sure about the root cause here. Can we as a first step re-trigger the Travis CI build?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10923#issuecomment-319399221,319399221,
