theuni,2016-06-08T14:20:24Z,@laanwj Thanks for grabbing this so quickly! A generic utility function is the way to go for sure.\n\nutACK e012f3cea0ca4096dd4dd59a356a973c43651912\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8168#issuecomment-224604182,224604182,

laanwj,2016-06-08T12:30:36Z,"Yes, that solution would be somewhat more elegant. Indeed, `ParsePrechecks` checks some number-parsing preconditions such as that one.\n\nI'm thinking about (at some point) implementing these functions from scratch instead of calling out to the C API. It wouldn't even be much longer, as there are just too many exceptions. This still doesn't exclude strto*l accepting locale-specific separators, for",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8168#discussion_r66245583,66245583,src/utilstrencodings.cpp

It works and seems sufficiently tested.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8168#discussion_r66246009,66246009,src/utilstrencodings.cpp
