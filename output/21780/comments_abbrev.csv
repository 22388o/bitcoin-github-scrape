jnewbery,2021-04-26 11:51:18,"> Not entirely sure how useful this is ...\n\nIt doesn't seem very useful to me. It's already possible to set the max mempool size using a command line arg/config option. Being able to set the value dynamically doesn't seem to add any benefit.\n\nWhat problem is this solving for you?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21780#issuecomment-826773139,826773139,
rebroad,2021-04-26 16:44:14,"@jnewbery at the moment, it's helping me test additional features I'm adding, but the other benefit is that I can have bitcoin-qt running low memory at some times, and at higher memory at others, without needing to restart the process. This is useful when using it on a machine that sometimes needs to be used for other things, and at other times can be dedicated to bitcoin.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21780#issuecomment-826988598,826988598,
