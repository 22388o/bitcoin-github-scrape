    "body": "They zeromq and libevent errors could be related to the vcpkg dependencies. I had to reinstall my vcpkg packages after updating Visual Studio. The error I got was ~~libraries being built with an older version of the runtime even though the latest version is still the same at `v.1.4.2`~~ `the object or library file was created with an older compiler than other objects; rebuild old objects and libraries`.\r\n\r\nReinstalling the vcpkg dependencies fixes zeromq and libevent but now the Qt5 binaries are also out of date. Sigh. That'll take a bit of time to adjust.",
