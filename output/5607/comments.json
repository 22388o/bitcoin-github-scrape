    "body": "- Okay\n- Okay\n- I'd presumed you'd wanted the lib perturbed as absolutely little as possible for confidence reasons; additionally, changing the _start() to take an argument rather than using a mutator or visible global would require either a varargs or an incompatible interface change. So.. I'll presume you're okay with an interface change after all. Originally I'd modified all library calls to pass the tablesize through function arguments but the mod was very extensive and invasive.\n- Okay\n",
