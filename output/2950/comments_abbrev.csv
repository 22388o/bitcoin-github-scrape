gavinandresen,2013-10-04T05:49:40Z,"Please add a comment to the ""key"" / ""wkey"" case statement that explains the old/new data schema. Maybe:\n\n```\n// Old wallets store keys as ""key""[pubkey] => [privkey]\n// ... which was slow for wallets with lots of keys, because the public key is re-derived from the private key\n// using EC operations as a checksum.\n// Newer wallets store keys as ""key""[pubkey] => [privkey][hash(pubkey,privkey)],",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2950#issuecomment-25677739,25677739,
