Tested the DMG https://bitcointools.jonasschnelli.ch/gitian/build/10.\n\nThe only difference I observed is, that the new image is not compressed:\n\nMaster is around 12 MB (bitcoin-0.19.99-osx-unsigned-2.dmg) where this PR is around 27 (uncompressed).\n```\n-rw-r--r--@ 1 jonasschnelli  staff  12494037 15 Feb 21:38 bitcoin-0.19.99-osx-unsigned-2.dmg\n-rw-r--r",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18151#issuecomment-586639489,586639489,

jonasschnelli,2020-02-26 18:41:02,"I'm unsure if xorriso supports HFS+ compression.\nThe libdmg-hfsplus code for compression looks quite extensive https://github.com/planetbeing/libdmg-hfsplus/commit/fc8a21682111a89d1700c4597780d15cae8ddb47 \nand I haven't seen a similar implementation in xorrisofs code.\n\nIf it doesn't support HFS+ compression, we might want to discuss if a uncompressed disk image is acceptable (27MB instead ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18151#issuecomment-591578451,591578451,

MarcoFalke,2020-03-12 12:51:09,"Even with pruning enabled, the savings of 15 MB are negligible when compared to the minimum disk usage Bitcoin Core requires.

fanquake,2020-05-25 12:58:59,"Rather than doing this, I think switching to a `.zip` is the [better solution](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/18128#issuecomment-633559692), and will result in even less macOS specific code/dependencies for the project to maintain going forward.
