MarcoFalke,2017-11-15T21:28:05Z,"Tend to NACK. Once they failed, they should never fail in the future, since it will only look at the `TRAVIS_COMMIT_RANGE`. So fixing it here won't really help you.\n\nI'd rather disable the whitspace check for non-pull_request completely.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11697#issuecomment-344734109,344734109,
jnewbery,2017-11-15T22:28:23Z,"Thanks @MarcoFalke - you're right. A better fix is to just disable linters for non-PR travis builds. Once a lint warning is in master it's really too late and we should just move on with our lives :)\n\nI've opened #11699 for that change.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11697#issuecomment-344750261,344750261,
