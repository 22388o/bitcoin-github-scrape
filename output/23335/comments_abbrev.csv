joankaradimov,2021-10-21 23:37:12,"> Looks like this only affects windows because it's in the #ifndef WIN32 #else case.\n\nYes, exactly. My guess is that `<string>` includes `<limits>` on Unix/gcc and `<codecvt>` includes `<limits>` on Windows/MSVC. But `<codecvt>` does not include `<limits>` on Windows/gcc. I haven't checked that, though.\n\n> it makes sense to move this to only include this with the other windows defines\n\",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23335#issuecomment-949079438,949079438,
