    "body": "Ok, I see why I couldn't reproduce this. Fwiw, the change looks fine.\n\n@gavinandresen I'm not sure why there's a need for step 3. With the previous 0.9.x behavior, the bundle was not created in the proper format, so a newer version of macdeployqtplus needed to be used in order to rebuild it. So it made sense then.\n\nNow that the bundle is being created correctly in the first place (I hope!), all that should be needed is a \"codesign ...\" on the bundle. Is there a reason I'm missing for re-running macdeployqtplus?\n\nShouldn't matter either way though, one we integrate the signing into gitian.\n",
