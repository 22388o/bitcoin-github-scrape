For most users the easiest way, in mu opinion, would be to use Debug window in Bitcoin-Qt. Or is it better to create some script (in e.g. Python) which does all necessary calls via network (purely automatically or may be interactively)?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2104#issuecomment-12665699,12665699,

Install THIS executable, then run it like THIS, then  open the Debug window and execute the following RPC commands: ....\n\nIf you write a Python script to try to test this, a bug in THAT code might hide a bug in your code.
