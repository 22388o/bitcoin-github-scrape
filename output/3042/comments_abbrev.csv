wtogami,2013-09-30T09:35:37Z,"I bumped the .zip revision because the payload actually was different.\n\nGood catch, I forgot to s/1.8/1.6/ with this PR that doesn't actually upgrade miniupnpc yet.  Should we do the same thing as the previous PR, one commit for the wine removal, and another to upgrade to 1.8?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3042#issuecomment-25347861,25347861,

theuni,2013-09-30T16:08:25Z,"Since there are a few of us working on build/gitian related changes, I'd recommend not merging these right away, just let them stack up. Maybe give them some kind of tag on github.\n\nIt'll only serve to confuse to bump the version numbers a half-dozen times before settling down.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3042#issuecomment-25376841,25376841,
wtogami,2013-10-01T08:24:19Z,VERSION file now supplies the string to the patch file.  This is now ready for commit.

theuni,2013-09-30T16:15:11Z,The need for manual intervention here could be avoided by using `cat VERSION`.\n\nThat's what the linux build does (see updateminiupnpcstrings.sh). Then there would be no accidents when bumping.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3042#discussion_r6662280,6662280,contrib/gitian-descriptors/deps-win32.yml
