Bushstar,2019-05-08 08:47:36,@practicalswift I agree. There are also cases that apply without LogPrint when error() is returned with a log message. I'll work through the ones you listed above and any additional ones related to error and create a new pull request including the change here. I expect changing all these entries will generate a few pull request conflicts.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15979#issuecomment-490403855,490403855,
