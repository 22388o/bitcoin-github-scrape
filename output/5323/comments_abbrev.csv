laanwj,2014-11-24T13:21:41Z,The order in which the setXXXmodel get called ideally shouldn't matter.\nWhy do we use the client model here?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5323#discussion_r20788709,20788709,src/qt/sendcoinsdialog.cpp
Diapolo,2014-11-25T15:54:13Z,"It was added by @cozz and is used in this line:\n`connect(clientModel, SIGNAL(numBlocksChanged(int)), this, SLOT(updateSmartFeeLabel()));`\n\nThat comment can perhaps just be removed... I just found it good to know that in that setModel() call we can be sure that setClientModel() was called (in current code).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5323#discussion_r20871599,20871599,src/qt/sendcoinsdialog.cpp
Diapolo,2014-11-25T15:55:50Z,Well perhaps that signal should be connected in setClientModel ;)... makes more sense and removes the comment ^^.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5323#discussion_r20871724,20871724,src/qt/sendcoinsdialog.cpp
