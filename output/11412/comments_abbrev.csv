laanwj,2017-09-28T06:38:45Z,"I don't see any updates to `safemode.cpp` here at all so I think you lost it in the simplification: `GetWarnings` contains hidden logic as to what warnings should trigger safe mode and which should not. Warnings only returned with `statusbar` and `gui` but should not trigger safe mode (such as the pre-version warning) should not be returned with `rpc`.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11412#issuecomment-332742018,332742018,

laanwj,2017-09-28T14:58:06Z,Yes I think it makes sense to do this as a post-safemode-removal optimization. We should make sure to deprecate it in the 0.16 release notes.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11412#issuecomment-332863688,332863688,
