    "body": "I think there is a good argument to be had that the PPA should be supported - better integration with native libraries is one of them. Some others were brought up in #17912. There may also be reasons not to.\r\n\r\nHowever, it takes a pretty crazy stretch of imagination to claim they're still supported right now, when https://launchpad.net/~bitcoin/+archive/ubuntu/bitcoin literally says \"NOT MAINTAINED (for new versions of Ubuntu), PLEASE USE THE SNAP INSTEAD\". There is a difference between someone maintaining a PPA personally, and the project deciding to support one.\r\n\r\n#18125 I believe correctly updated the documentation to match reality. If we want to change that reality we should discuss it, but simply changing the URL isn't the way to do that.",
