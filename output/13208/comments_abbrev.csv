sipa,2018-05-11T18:59:12Z,I think these sort of additions belong more in `fundrawtransaction` than `sendtoaddress` and `sendmany`.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13208#issuecomment-388455801,388455801,
kallewoof,2018-05-12T03:13:05Z,Why would I have to manually create a transaction just because I wanted to fine tune the UTXO:s used? (Adding to fundrawtx sounds like a good idea though!),https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13208#issuecomment-388525927,388525927,
promag,2018-05-12T08:19:33Z,"Agree with @sipa, which inputs and other constraints definitely belong to the `*rawtransaction` calls. Is there a reason to not use those?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13208#issuecomment-388539240,388539240,
kallewoof,2018-05-12T09:24:55Z,I guess it makes more sense to keep it in `fundrawtransaction`. I'll be back. Probably.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13208#issuecomment-388542576,388542576,
