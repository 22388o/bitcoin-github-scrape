gmaxwell,2019-03-23T23:37:03Z,"This sounds okay to me but it will remain trivial to link HS nodes with their non-HS addresses, we should document that clearly.   (for example, hand a node a orphan txn on one identity then observe that it won't getdata the same txid on another)",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15651#issuecomment-475914086,475914086,

MarcoFalke,2019-03-25T19:42:19Z,Would there be any reason to make it user-configurable? Could the port collide with something else? Does this need release notes?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15651#issuecomment-476348544,476348544,
luke-jr,2019-04-04T10:19:43Z,"@MarcoFalke This is only for the dedicated hidden service we create, so no, nothing else can use it.\n\nThe only reason for release notes would be if the privacy leak is serious enough to warrant an advisory; but IIRC this is only one of multiple ways to tie a Tor node to a clearnet node, so probably not.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15651#issuecomment-479839509,479839509,
laanwj,2019-06-18T15:28:14Z,"I think this is fine.\n\nThere will be a slight service interruption due to this due to the new address needing to be propagated, but always using the ""standard"" virtual port by default makes perfect sense, there's no resource contention in Tor and need to deviate from that. \n\nI don't think release notes are necessary.\n\nThe user can already configure it by setting up their own Tor hidden",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15651#issuecomment-503187263,503187263,
