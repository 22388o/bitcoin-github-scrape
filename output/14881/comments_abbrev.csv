mmachicao,2018-12-06T20:28:34Z,"Hi Empact.\n\nThank you for the feedback, but I prefer to keep modifications to a minimum. Apart from this, I am a newbie with this code and not really proficient with C/C++, which is actually why I am focusing on unit testing in the first place. Functions added are either read only or do not modify the runtime data. That is why I did this in the first place. \n\nFirst priority here is to dig ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14881#discussion_r239602774,239602774,src/timedata.h
