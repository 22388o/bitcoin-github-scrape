I didn't try adding swap to prevent these crashes; I'm not sure how to manage that properly, i.e. in a way that too much swap usage doesn't end up cancelling the benefits of these caches.\r\n\r\nI'll leave them running for a bit. So far it seems clear that merging either of these PR's would be quite helpful on low-end machines, but which one is less clear. It probably depends on the choices for `dbcache` and `prune` and my guess is that machines with more RAM would benefit from pruning as aggressively as possible to minimize the number of cache flushes (but beyond ~8 GB of RAM it wouldn't matter, because it would never flush).\r\n\r\nI just started three `t2.medium` instances with 2 vCPU, using `dbcache=3000`.

    "body": "To clarify, is `IsInitialBlockDownload()` something that only happens once in the life time of a node, or is this also `true` if it needs to do a large catch up? If the latter, there is a case to be made for conservative pruning (or putting aggressive pruning behind a config flag).\r\n\r\nWhen you run something like c-lightning against a pruned bitcoind node, it's constantly processing blocks as they come in. A large prune event could mess with this process if for some reason the other application isn't completely caught up. This is less of a problem for the initial sync if that other application doesn't care about pre-history. E.g. c-lightning doesn't need history before its wallet creation block, so the trick there is to wait with launching it until `bitcoind` finishes IBD, and then keep them both running.\r\n\r\nBut there may be other applications that need to track some sort of index all the way through IBD where it's important they don't lose sync.",

I'll keep an eye on it. Maybe it has something to do with the large `dbcache`? Because of the more frequent prune events the `dbcache` doesn't grow as much on master and the 10% prune branch.

    "body": "@n1bor for [my own project on AWS](https://medium.com/provoost-on-crypto/bitcoin-core-lightning-rails-on-aws-ad3bd45b11e0), I also use the strategy of doing IBD on a fast machine (`i3.2xlarge`). Anything with > 10 GB RAM to prevent the cache from flushing and a disk big enough to avoid pruning (doesn't have to be SSD). The bigger disk is ephemeral and goes away after you downgrade to a regular instance type, so I do a manual prune at the end and copy the data to the persistent disk.\r\n\r\nI'll look into [Cold HDD (sc1) Volumes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSVolumeTypes.html#EBSVolumeTypes_sc1) for that project, because it `c-lightning` doesn't fully love pruned nodes yet, but that's off topic...\r\n\r\nBut you don't have that luxury on a physical machine like the various [Rasberry / Orange / Nano] Pi's out there. So it's quite useful if IBD performed better on a constrained machines. Also, even that price point pruning still saves $5 a month in storage at the current chain size.",

That would explain why higher frequency pruning, which generally keeps cache below 300 MB in that period doesn't slow down. While at the same time it would explain why 10 GB of cache, where all entries are `FRESH`, doesn't slow down either. Does that seem even plausible?\r\n\r\nI could test this by deliberately interrupting IBD on master on a non pruned node at roughly the same blocks where this branch flushed the cache: 244000, 298000, 332000, 355000, 373000, 388000, 401000, 414000, 424000, 436000, 446000, 455000 (the latter two being the range where master starts slowing down).",
