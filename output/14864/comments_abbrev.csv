practicalswift,2018-12-04T10:50:23Z,"Would it make sense to use `(set -e; eval ""$SCRIPT"") || RET=1 && echo ""scripted-diff execution failed.""`?\n\nThat would allow us to catch execution failures within the scripted-diff run. Currently such execution failure are silent (as long as the diff produces the expected result).\n\nIt probably shouldn't be done as part of this PR as that would change behaviour.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14864#discussion_r238612666,238612666,test/lint/commit-script-check.sh
dongcarl,2018-12-04T16:08:43Z,"Not sure about `set -e`, as I've found that people are not used to its behaviour and there are legitimate uses of not failing immediately upon the failure of one command. I think that as long as the diff produces the expected result, we should be good.\n\nWhat I _would_ like to have is `set -x`, which doesn't change behaviour but allows us to see line by line execution fully expanded (in case it",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14864#discussion_r238728259,238728259,test/lint/commit-script-check.sh
