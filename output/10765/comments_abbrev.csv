ReneNyffenegger,2017-07-13T11:47:32Z,I really have no idea what's going on with this pull request. I've added the brackets for the if statement - now this pull request says that I want to merge 62 commits ... This is if course not true.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10765#issuecomment-315054907,315054907,
ReneNyffenegger,2017-07-13T11:57:52Z,"@jonasschnelli I've done the `git reset --hard...`, `git cherry-pick...`, `git push --force`, as proposed. I have to admit I have no idea what exactly that did to either my forked repo and/or the github bitcoin/bitcoin repository.\nThe changes seem right, though.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10765#issuecomment-315057091,315057091,
