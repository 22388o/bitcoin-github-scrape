I like your approach, but I'm wondering if this will still be accurate about `create_self_transfer`:\n`""""""Create and return a tx with the specified fee_rate. Fee may be exact or at most one satoshi higher than needed.""""""`\nBecause right now, using a fee rate of `Decimal(""0.003"")` the P2PK tx will have a fee of `Decimal('0.0005025')`, but the exact fee rates ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22089#issuecomment-850079016,850079016,
