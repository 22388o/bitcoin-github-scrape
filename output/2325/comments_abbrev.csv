laanwj,2013-02-20T17:22:38Z,"@diapolo Sorry, it's probably because we're mostly used to responding to comments we _don't_ agree with\n\nI agree that this will have to be retranslated (though with 0.8 final being out of the door there's a lot of time for that).\n\nAnd for wallet/block database, yeah, I'd say leave out ""database"" for the wallet and make the message ""Verifying wallet"".\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2325#issuecomment-13844342,13844342,
