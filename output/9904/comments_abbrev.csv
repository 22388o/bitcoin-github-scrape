MarcoFalke,2017-03-02T21:59:23Z,smaller diff and we don't want to imply assertions with side effects are our default coding style :P,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9904#discussion_r104040591,104040591,src/test/test_bitcoin.cpp
benma,2017-03-02T23:00:01Z,Then you should also do the same with the above BOOST_REQUIRE :),https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9904#discussion_r104052265,104052265,src/test/test_bitcoin.cpp

laanwj,2017-03-03T06:14:45Z,"Meh, in the tests it's pretty normal to check something with side effects. This is only an ""assertion"" in the abstract sense, not the C/C++ sense that it will potentially be disabled (new: tests in release mode, with disabled tests!).\n\nAnyhow let's not nitpick this two-line test change to death.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9904#discussion_r104094590,104094590,src/test/test_bitcoin.cpp
