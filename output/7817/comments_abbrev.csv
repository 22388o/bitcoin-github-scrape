petertodd,2016-05-20T08:18:51Z,"@paveljanik So the status quo, is that all incoming unconfirmed txs look the same; I'm concerned that showing some types of unconfirmed incoming txs differently than others in UI's intended for general users gives the false impression that Bitcoin Core can reliably tell you about the risk of any particular unconfirmed incoming txs; expert-level UI's like the RPC interface are much less of a concer",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7817#issuecomment-220544312,220544312,
