You can therefore, have at most 117 inbound connections.\n+\n+The default settings can result in relatively significant traffic consumption.\n+\n+Ways to reduce traffic:\n+\n+1. Use `-maxuploadtarget=<MiB per day>`\n+\n+A major component of the traffic is caused by serving historic blocks to other nodes\n+during the initial blocks download phase (syncing up a new node).\n+This option can be specified in MiB per day and is turned off by default.\n+This is *not* a hard limit; only a threshold to minimize the outbound\n+traffic. When the limit is about to be reached, the uploaded data is cut by no\n+longer serving historic blocks (blocks older than one week).\n+Keep in mind that new nodes require other nodes that are willing to serve\n+historic blocks. **The recommended minimum is 144 blocks per day (max. 144MB\n+per day)**\n+\n+2.
