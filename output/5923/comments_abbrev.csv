gmaxwell,2015-03-18T18:37:27Z,"I have no objection here, fewer magic numbers is good, but the behavior of the system may be completely ill-defined for arbitrary parameters. (Just a kind of silly example, a target spacing of 0 would otherwise work in the codebase AFAIK but here would result in everything turning to NaNs.)\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5923#issuecomment-83114740,83114740,

morcos,2015-03-18T18:58:31Z,"I don't think it makes sense to change this.  The command line argument that's passed is bytes per minute, and we're multiplying it by 10 a couple of lines below.  You can't change the decay exponent here without fixing the comparison as well or changing the command line argument to be interpreted as  ""bytes per 1/10th of a target spacing"".  \n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5923#issuecomment-83122169,83122169,
kroese,2015-03-18T20:05:59Z,"@morcos Maybe you're right, but don't you agree it's strange to use a 10 minute window for this when the block duration could be much shorter (or longer)? \n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5923#issuecomment-83148872,83148872,
