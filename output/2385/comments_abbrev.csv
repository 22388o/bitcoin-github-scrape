petertodd,2013-03-19T19:04:58Z,"We really need a -setalertkey option to use a non-standard alert key for testing, along with tools to create alert messages. Make CAlert::CheckSignature() use a single pszAlertKey and then set that key appropriately at startup, as well as have a contrib/alerts directory with some simple Python scripts to create alerts. It'd let the unit tests include actual alerts with a known testing key too.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2385#issuecomment-15136181,15136181,

mikehearn,2013-03-21T12:51:56Z,You should mention it in the warning that's printed if you don't have a bitcoin.conf (with a username/password).
