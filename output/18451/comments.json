Every API change is going to cause pain for users, encouraging them to not upgrade to the latest version and thus causing harm to everyone involved.\r\n\r\nI think they can be removed when 0.19.0 is EOL or at least no longer actively maintained, since at that point we assume that no one is depending on the deprecated API.\r\n\r\nI understand an argument for aggressive deprecation and removal when there is a massive maintenance burden (such as wallet accounts) or danger in using the deprecated API, but I don't see any of this apply here.",
