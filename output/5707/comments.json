    "body": "I expected this to result in the same binary, but it doesn't. What appears to happen is that in 40e96a3 it puts the character in a local buffer on the stack, whereas in 14d023f it uses the address of the constant. This makes sense as it passes a reference (pointer).\n\nIn any case, I did a verification in which I replaced the constants with #defines, and that one matched.\n\nI also did rudimentary testing to make sure this doesn't result in a different on-disk format. So ACK.\n",
