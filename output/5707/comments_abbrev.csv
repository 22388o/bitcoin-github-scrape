Ideally you'd mark the enum as char, but that's not valid C++98 (and we can't use C++11 due to compatibility reasons yet), so for now you'll have to stick with a list of constants rather than making it an enum.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5707#issuecomment-71377626,71377626,

What appears to happen is that in 40e96a3 it puts the character in a local buffer on the stack, whereas in 14d023f it uses the address of the constant. This makes sense as it passes a reference (pointer).\n\nIn any case, I did a verification in which I replaced the constants with #defines, and that one matched.\n\nI also did rudimentary",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5707#issuecomment-71439004,71439004,
