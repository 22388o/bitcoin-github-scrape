Looks like a definite improvement to me, and low-risk due to (mostly) move only.\n\nIt becomes kind of apparent from this how much is exported in main.h that \n- a) initialization/shutdown purposes (InitBlockIndex/LoadBlockIndex/UnloadBlockIndex/ThreadScriptCheck at least). \n- b) only used lnternally (WriteBlockToDisk, ProcessMessages, GetMinRelayFee at least), but see c - possibly this means they need tests\n- c) exported only for testing and could be static/internal otherwise (CScriptCheck)\n- d) pure utility (AreInputsStandard, GetLegacySigOpCount, IsStandardTx, GetP2SHSigOpCount)\n\n(a) could be reduced by factoring the initialization and shutdown sequences from init.cpp and moving them with what is initiialized\n(b) could be removed from the header, or tests added\n(c) is always thorny, you need to expose them but only to tests, could have a special \"test interface\"\n(d) could be moved to a standard.cpp/standard.h\n\n@sipa may want to weigh in here too as he has specific ideas about refactoring main.\n",

    "body": "For b and c, maybe a half-solution that just comes to mind, is just leaving the definitions in main.cpp but expose them with an independent header like main_test.h or something. Just a random thought.\n\nI'm basically focusing on consensus and policy checks. Trying to take advantage of potential similarities between their dependencies. Right now it's kind of a mess that doesn't even pass the tests, but if you're curious, here's my latest branch on that: https://github.com/jtimon/bitcoin/commits/consensus_policy\nI guess it mostly falls into the \"d\" category, with a little bit of \"a\" as you move constants and globals out.\nThis (and therefore #5669 and the longest branch) needed rebase.\nI'm also trying to isolate a good small base for policy to use as an example and confirm what I think @luke-jr and I (and hopefully everyone) can agree on.\n",

    "body": "Maybe my terminology is confused. I mean main is a client of net, building on top of it. Net should not know anything about what its clients do. CNodeStateStats is stats about CNodeState, the message processing specific data structure about nodes. Message processing is done in main, so this data structure definition belongs there and nowhere else.\n\nDon't get me wrong: the current placing of code in main and net is terrible, but we shouldn't hack around that. Message processing needs to be split up, and moved out to separate modules, and the related data structures with it.\n",
