maaku,2016-07-14T17:02:23Z,"I really don't think that we should be moving everything that libconsensus is code-dependent on into the `consensus` directory.  That does not help clarity of the code base. Things like serialization and basic data structures in `primitives` probably deserve to be their own library, which libconsensus links against. Moving them all into the consensus directory doesn't help IMHO.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8328#issuecomment-232727295,232727295,
