laanwj,2014-06-02T11:19:30Z,I'm sure there is a good reason to use .tar.gzs instead of zips for the intermediate dependencies. For example for `qt-linux32-4.6.4-gitian` I used a .tar.gz because I needed support for symlinks.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4271#issuecomment-44825681,44825681,
Michagogo,2014-06-05T19:28:33Z,"@laanwj Well, there may be -- but other things (such as the descriptor names) suggest that the OS X descriptors may have been made independently from the current ones, rather than in coordination, consistent with the current ones.\n\n@theuni, could you comment?
