jnewbery,2017-10-03T17:14:31Z,"Tested ACK fafff1220cf798e25f02cdd8affb70506dd366cc. Works with py2 and py3 for me.\n\nOut of interest, what are the plans for deprecating py2 for `make && make check`? Obviously we can't include any of the functional tests for `make check` while we still support py2.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11433#issuecomment-333914644,333914644,
MarcoFalke,2017-10-03T18:45:24Z,"I am not against deprecating py2, but we should do it properly such that `./configure` fails early and warns about it. Also it should be mentioned in the release notes.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11433#issuecomment-333940703,333940703,
