    "body": "> A real manpage is a piece of free-form prose, describing the utility in all detail; that's not something you put into a help() printf\r\n\r\nI don't understand why you can't put prose in a printf. I like your prose, I think it would be welcome in a printf, and C++11 supports multiline (\"raw\") strings that can contain as much text as you want to write. I guess your preferred solution to the problem of manpages duplicating source documentation is to remove the documentation from the source code. I think that would be reasonable as long as there's some kind of tool that can take the manpage and generate -help strings or whatever documentation we might need for platforms like windows where manpages are not the \"one and only place\" for documentation to exist.\r\n\r\nAlso, I don't know if you proposed a solution for deduping the options documentation between the `bitcoind.1` and `bitcoin-qt.1` manpages, because we don't want to have to maintain two copies of that either. Maybe you could add a new `bitcoind.conf` manpage that the other two manpages would reference.",

This was less than a version ago. See #8608.\r\n\r\nThe old debian manpages were removed here: b194872 - both due to license issues, and due to not being maintained.\r\n\r\nWe're not going to change this again now. Sorry.\r\n",
