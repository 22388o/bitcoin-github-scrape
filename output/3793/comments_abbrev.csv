cozz,2014-03-04T13:08:33Z,"From my understanding ""-discover"" is a boolean argument. In this case the proposed change would not make sense.\n=&lt;n&gt; is meant to be for parameters that take a numeric value.\n\nThough I agree that -discover=0 to disable a boolean option is a little bit confusing. So maybe we should avoid boolean options with default=1 in general, and always provide the opposite: ""-nodiscover"" in this case.

These are equivalent and both can make sense in some settings, for example in the configuration file option=0 is slightly clearer.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3793#issuecomment-36622716,36622716,

paveljanik,2014-03-04T22:07:25Z,"OK, I spend a bit of time on this and I found out, that the concept of external IP address discovery is only applicable in very special cases (why it was added at all?

gmaxwell,2014-03-04T22:16:16Z,"Funny that you think discovery is ""very special cases"" when it's likely the majority of hosts. Discovery doesn't just cover the external IP service, it also covers UPNP discovery (which also covers the firewall cases).  There are incomplete patches floating around which eliminate the service usage and instead use other Bitcoin nodes to accomplish discovery.\n\nI have no opinion on the parameter de",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3793#issuecomment-36685526,36685526,
