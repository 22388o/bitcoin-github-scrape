MarcoFalke,2019-05-13 18:20:54,How much are the speedups?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16019#issuecomment-491931992,491931992,
promag,2019-05-13 21:08:29,"@MarcoFalke didn't measured, but think there's no noticeable speedup. I'm just doing the same as [L120](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16019/files#diff-1297c2ae09a3b203cb6fa218fa311b0dR120).",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16019#issuecomment-491987553,491987553,
laanwj,2019-05-29 10:18:15,I'd prefer to keep this code simpler if there's no noticable speedup.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16019#issuecomment-496876931,496876931,
promag,2019-05-29 18:06:02,@laanwj not even replacing `clear()` with the `assert()`?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16019#issuecomment-497047131,497047131,
MarcoFalke,2019-05-13 18:20:16,The `clear` here is for documentation purposes (and clearing an empty vector is free anyway),https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16019#discussion_r283473885,283473885,src/script/standard.cpp
promag,2019-05-13 21:09:13,If it's documentation then maybe change to `assert(vSolutionsRet.empty())`?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16019#discussion_r283538148,283538148,src/script/standard.cpp
Empact,2019-05-17 03:13:23,"Would suggest keeping the line - it enforces an invariant against future change, and would be good to consider it separately if we are to change it. `assert` could be overkill given this is basically a failure case anyway.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16019#discussion_r284965453,284965453,src/script/standard.cpp
jb55,2019-05-18 15:04:15,yeah but assert would catch a situation where you missed a return higher up which is something that would definitely be good to catch right away.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16019#discussion_r285345400,285345400,src/script/standard.cpp
promag,2019-05-20 13:34:48,Now using `assert(...)`. It's an unrelated change and I don't mind dropping it but either way `assert()` looks better to me.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16019#discussion_r285595028,285595028,src/script/standard.cpp
