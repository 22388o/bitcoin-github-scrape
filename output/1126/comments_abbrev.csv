luke-jr,2012-04-20T00:02:23Z,Is there a reason to use these instead of the standard string.h (memset) and stdio.h (sprintf)?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1126#issuecomment-5235367,5235367,
jgarzik,2012-04-20T00:49:46Z,"I admit I'm unclear on the advantages of cstring/cstdio over the normal header.\n\nThe bitcoin codebase does currently prefer the C variant (""#include <stdio.h>"").\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1126#issuecomment-5235902,5235902,
laanwj,2012-04-20T05:30:52Z,"cstdio and such are more canonical c++.\n\nThe actual difference is that stdio.h puts the symbols in the global namespace and cstdio puts them in `std` (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7596406/stdio-h-not-standard-in-c).  \n\nAll in all, it doesn't make much difference. But we should not mix them.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1126#issuecomment-5238111,5238111,
