mikehearn,2012-08-24T20:38:30Z,"There are contract protocols that use zero value outputs. Of course they can also be of 1 satoshi in value. I don't think the difference of 1 satoshi affects how likely they are to be reclaimed nor the real-world scalability of Bitcoin given the tiny values involved. It's sort of an academic argument, the apps would get implemented even if zero-value outputs are awkward to use.\n\nMy problem with ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1718#issuecomment-8014166,8014166,

Making these outputs non-standard might lead to weird hacks in future applications, but we can always make these outputs standard again once real apps have been implemented and the utility is proven.
