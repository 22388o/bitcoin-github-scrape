petertodd,2014-02-21T05:53:11Z,Downright counterproductive to do so without getting rid of bare CHECKSIG and CHECKMULTISIG - enforcing only P2SH and pay-to-pubkey-hash - as data-in-chain users will just use them instead at a cost to the UTXO set. (Mastercoin even has code to make the data indistinguishable from valid compressed pubkeys) Of course @mikehearn has raised objections to forcing P2SH-only for multisig in the past.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3715#issuecomment-35701201,35701201,

In general, We seem to prefer that core devs dabble less in policy, and try to encourage miners to take the policy reins in hand more often.\n\nGiving miners a policy tool and letting them exercise freedom of choice seems like a good, neutral meta-policy that could be applied to this pull request.\n\nA",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3715#issuecomment-35702112,35702112,
