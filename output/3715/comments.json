In general, We seem to prefer that core devs dabble less in policy, and try to encourage miners to take the policy reins in hand more often.\n\nGiving miners a policy tool and letting them exercise freedom of choice seems like a good, neutral meta-policy that could be applied to this pull request.\n\nAs a general rule, too:  as controversy on $topic increases, the less I want to be The Decider, however accidentally or intentionally.  Saw it several times on the Linux kernel.  Person Foo would pressure Linus Torvalds to make a this-direction-or-that-direction decision.  The best route, and one certainly preferred by Linus, is to refuse to make a deicions, forcing the parties to figure out the damn problem on their own :)\n",
