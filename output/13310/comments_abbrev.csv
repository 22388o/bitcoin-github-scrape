Empact,2018-05-23T11:31:46Z,`CWallet::ScanForWalletTransactions` has an implementation that only reports every ~~1%~~ 100 blocks.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13310#issuecomment-391314278,391314278,
promag,2018-05-23T11:38:12Z,"@Empact IMO the receiver is the one that should throttle, because he is the one that knows the resolution. Anyway, looks like `ScanForWalletTransactions` reports progress each 100 blocks, or am I wrong?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13310#issuecomment-391315808,391315808,
Empact,2018-05-23T11:54:17Z,Yep you're right on `ScanForWalletTransactions`.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13310#issuecomment-391319674,391319674,
GreatSock,2018-05-23T21:13:30Z,"I think it should report every 1% change. But since changes less than 1% won't be visible, maybe check if the percentage have actually changed before updating. Calling `ShowProgress` 100 times should be fine right?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13310#issuecomment-391498317,391498317,
promag,2018-05-23T21:21:11Z,"I don't mind doing something like that...\n\n> But since changes less than 1% won't be visible\n\nBut how do you know? What if you have a progress bar with, for instance, 200px width? It should report 0.5%.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13310#issuecomment-391500472,391500472,
GreatSock,2018-05-23T21:34:07Z,"Right now `ShowProgress` seems to take an integer which means 1% changes won't be visible.\n\nBut I agree: `ShowProgress` should instead take a float(maybe even between 0 and 1) and then check if it should update by itself. This would probably be better since it can then choose to display the progress however it wants.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13310#issuecomment-391503873,391503873,

GreatSock,2018-05-23T21:48:33Z,"I would personally prefer giving it a float since I feel like it would be more flexible. But then again, why not do both? We could just overload the function.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13310#issuecomment-391507533,391507533,
