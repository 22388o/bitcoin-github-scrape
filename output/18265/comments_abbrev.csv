That doesn't seem to be the case.\n\nCan you give a more detailed example when this would be appropriate?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18265#issuecomment-595988698,595988698,

Someone modified the type from a `const char*` to a `std::vector` and automake started spitting errors until you manually deleted the `.raw.h` file.\n\nYou can see this by checking out and trying to compile 4db2f8cf0f63cf2a130e238d59f5b6032420f83d -- and then switch back to master and try",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18265#issuecomment-596031338,596031338,
