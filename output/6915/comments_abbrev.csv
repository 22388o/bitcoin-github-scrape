sipa,2015-11-11T07:49:05Z,utACK.\n\nFor BIP68 transactions maybe it makes sense to replace the spendscoinbase flag with a minimum height/time at which the transaction becomes valid (which also generalized the wanted behaviour for coinbase-spending transactions).\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6915#issuecomment-155695428,155695428,
morcos,2015-11-12T20:54:53Z,"@sipa, @sdaftuar and I discussed adding the BIP68 time and locktime at length.\nWe were waiting for the code to finalize, and had gotten hung up on the locktime potentially being quite recent and therefore causing a great many transactions to have all 3 heights recalculated on a reorg.  But now I'm realizing it makes a lot of sense to only include BIP68 and coinbase height, and then separately sca",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6915#issuecomment-156231118,156231118,
