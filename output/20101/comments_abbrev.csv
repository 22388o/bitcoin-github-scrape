Otherwise add a release note.\n\nSurely there will be a release note, but just as surely nobody reads release notes. The right place for a useful error message is in the error message, not somewhere else that nobody will look for it.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20101#issuecomment-705455243,705455243,

gwillen,2020-10-08 10:00:38,"> @gwillen I mean the error code, not the error message.\n\nAh, I see! I have no opinion either way about the error code. I don't expect that it matters to people just reading the message on the console. So if changing it might cause breakage, I would say change the message but leave the error code alone.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20101#issuecomment-705466128,705466128,
achow101,2020-10-08 12:47:30,"> This is breaking change, is it really worth changing the error?\n\nIMO it is because the previous error code didn't really make sense. The RPC method wasn't not found, there were just no wallet available to run it on.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20101#issuecomment-705544322,705544322,
