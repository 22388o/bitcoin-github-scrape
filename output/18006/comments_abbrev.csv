fanquake,2020-01-26 13:51:20,"Thanks, however these [kinds of refactors generally aren't accepted](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#refactoring), and it's clear you didn't run any of our unit tests before opening this PR. If you're interested in contributing, I'd suggest taking a look at the [good first issue list](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+fi",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18006#issuecomment-578503781,578503781,
