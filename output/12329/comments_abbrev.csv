theuni,2018-02-01T20:57:24Z,"@sipa mentioned on IRC that these were originally retried because they may be tor seed attempts, which can only try one address, as opposed to normal seed resolves which may return a long list.\n\nSo by not retrying these, if using tor, you only get seednode_count chances to make a connection and learn some new addresses.\n\nTo avoid that, I think we should just re-run the entire ThreadDNSAddr",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12329#issuecomment-362399271,362399271,

theuni,2018-02-01T19:57:49Z,"Yes, this is actually a really big help for the libevent code. This needs to be a one-way function so that it can be run async, with failures optionally triggering callbacks.\n\nThe oneshot reinsertion was the only thing preventing making that change trivially.\n\nEdit: See here for that change on the libevent PR: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11227/commits/03e73a734ceac8a2fc7ed1a21a",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12329#discussion_r165470779,165470779,src/net.cpp
