vasild,2021-10-07 13:41:27,"IMO `/*name=*/` and `/*addr=*/` is excessive here. I can understand using these comments in places where constants are passed, e.g.\n\n```cpp\nfunc(5, true);\n```\nmay be better as\n```cpp\nfunc(/*timeout=*/5, /*allow_lookup=*/true);\n```\n\nBut when using variables that have their own names, `/*foo=*/` should not be necessary:\n\n```cpp\nint timeout = ...\nbool allow_lookup = ...\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23219#discussion_r724192490,724192490,src/netbase.cpp
