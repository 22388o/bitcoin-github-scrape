This is virtual memory, but on 32 bit systems that's a rare commodity - yes, this could be configured...\n- Our level of parallelism is bad. 29 out of 39 non-wallet RPC calls keep cs_main locked all the time. This includes most calls that actually take time to compute.\n\nI'd prefer just documenting the option better.\n",
