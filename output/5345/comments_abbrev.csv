gmaxwell,2014-11-21T20:05:31Z,"Adding threads implies a fair amount of memory utilization due to per-thread stacks and assorted overhead, so I care. ... we've been working hard to reduce memory usage to make bitcoind fit on smaller VPSes and such, and this would take back much of the gains.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5345#issuecomment-64029749,64029749,

Just raising to 8 could just lead to similar problems in the future.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5345#issuecomment-64052993,64052993,
laanwj,2014-11-24T07:24:40Z,"NACK for now.\n- Threads take up memory (8MB or 4MB per thread on 64 and 32 bit). This is virtual memory, but on 32 bit systems that's a rare commodity - yes, this could be configured...\n- Our level of parallelism is bad. 29 out of 39 non-wallet RPC calls keep cs_main locked all the time. This includes most calls that actually take time to compute.\n\nI'd prefer just documenting the option better",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5345#issuecomment-64158343,64158343,
