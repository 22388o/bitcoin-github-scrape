sje397,2012-02-17T15:37:25Z,"One more thing: changing tabs calls showNormal. That moves the window position slightly for me, in KDE and in Windows. You could add 'if(isVisible())' there, but maybe the dummy widget is better after all (but that does reset the window position to a corner of the screen on hide or minimize for me in KDE). There's also the option of saving/restoring window geometry using QSettings and QWidget::sav",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/853#issuecomment-4022139,4022139,

laanwj,2012-02-17T20:47:51Z,"@luke-jr   you don't have that problem without this pull request? I find it strange, because this patch _no longer_ overrides showNormal (which is called when you click a tab).\n\nThe stuff in changeEvent does not fire when you change tabs (at least, shouldn't be, as it explicitly checks for state transitions from and to minimized...).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/853#issuecomment-4027627,4027627,

Maximising is good too.\n\nThere is still one bug, but it's probably Qt: if I hide the window using the close button the first time I hide it, restoring it the first time puts it back in a corner of the desktop. It doesn't happen if I minimise. Subsequent hide events via minimise or close don't have the issue.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/853#issuecomment-4033859,4033859,
