laanwj,2018-12-18T11:00:10Z,Concept ACK; # confirmations is more useful information than confirmed or not.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14988#issuecomment-448182002,448182002,
promag,2018-12-18T14:56:09Z,"I'm leaning towards NAK:\n - does this fixes something? what is the point of, for instance, reading 1000 confirmations?\n - column ""Type"" already helps identify trusted transactions\n - this changes column order and while columns are ""named"" this can cause some failures if CSV is processed elsewhere\n\nMaybe more useful is to append the block height, if any?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14988#issuecomment-448247912,448247912,
jonasschnelli,2019-03-15T07:03:35Z,"Tend to agree with @promag. Confirmation count is also probably invalid (old) the moment you export...\n\n> [...] which can lead to transactions sent to yourself with 0 confirmations to be labeled as confirmed\n\nWhy not fix that instead?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14988#issuecomment-473180529,473180529,

jonasschnelli,2019-10-09T09:23:28Z,"Tested a bit.\nThis fixes the unconfirmed send-to-self transactions but it will list immature mined funds as confirmed.\nMaybe make use of `status.status` instead of accessing the `depth`?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14988#issuecomment-539917548,539917548,
