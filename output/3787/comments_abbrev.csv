laanwj,2014-03-04T13:31:37Z,@sipa Which makes sense. Master is the next major release. Updates to the release notes for 0.9 should go in the 0.9 branch.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3787#issuecomment-36623597,36623597,
sipa,2014-03-04T13:54:43Z,@laanwj I was confused by seeing the rc2 release note changes as part of this PR. Why aren't those in 0.9.0 or master yet?\n\nIs master supposed to become 0.9.1?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3787#issuecomment-36625480,36625480,
laanwj,2014-03-04T14:01:53Z,"@sipa Gavin made the 0.9.0rc2 release notes based on the 0.9.0rc1 ones but didn't update them in git.\n\nAs I understand it, master will become 0.10.0 (or 1.0.0). If there is a 0.9.1 it makes sense to base it on the 0.9.0 branch. This is also what we did for 0.8.x (at least the latter ones, we only forked the 0.8 branch from master at 0.8.2).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3787#issuecomment-36626087,36626087,
