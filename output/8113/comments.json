    "body": "Yes, agreed. Maybe that's a future possibility after the net refactor. IMO the most important privacy invariant for DNS changes is that we don't ever do DNS queries when `-dns=0` is set. Would be nice to have an auto test of some kind for that.\n\nIn any case that's a tangent. I think #8097 was nice in that it was only a local change to an (apparently rarely used) RPC call. This involves some regression risk for code outside that as well. On the other hand this is a more thorough solution, and at least one person (@thebluematt) cares about the functionality it seems better to do that.\n\n@theuni can you take a look?\n",

If fDisconnect is set, it tends to be processed quickly.\n\n> ConnectSocketByName() only tries 1 of the resolved results, which seems to conflict with the PR description. Unless I'm reading incorrectly, adding \"foo.com\" which resolves to 10 ips will mean 2 min between tries for its ips, with random collisions mixed in.\n\nOnly the random order changed.

The rest looks sane. Though I suspect @TheBlueMatt will object to the behavioral change here. IMO it's more sane in that it lines up with my expectations of how this would work, but it breaks the \"addnode a dns entry and it will quickly detect a change and create a new connection\" persistence model.\n\nI'd like to point out that this logic is also much easier to re-implement in the refactored code, as the internal connection handler doesn't need to keep up with application state. Instead, it will just retry a dns connection any time the current one disconnects.\n",
