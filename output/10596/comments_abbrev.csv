theuni,2017-06-16T23:52:31Z,"std::thread takes arguments by value/rvalue only. Taking a reference would be dangerous as the arg could go out of scope before it's used in the thread.\n\nEdit: Thinking more about this, std::thread's constructor turns references into copies anyway, so I suppose a const reference here would just extend the lifetime of the copy as usual.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10596#discussion_r122552827,122552827,src/net.h
benma,2017-06-17T11:52:19Z,"I also read that the reference is turned into a copy, but I figured it's better to be explicit about it being a copy.
