gmaxwell,2017-09-05T22:47:20Z,I've been seeing a LOT of people reporting it on 0.15rc including RC2 and RC3 but I have had no reason to believe it was newly introduced.  @jonasschnelli Why do you believe that it is gone?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11245#issuecomment-327324801,327324801,
jonasschnelli,2017-09-05T22:49:30Z,"@gmaxwell: I just tested 0.14.1 and 0.15.0rc2 on Windows 7, 8.1 and 10. And 0.14.1 has the issue (when moving the window out of the screen boundaries with RedEdit) while 0.15.0rc2 does not have the issue. My assumption then is, that either it's gone by a Qt upstream fix or by a change within our codebase.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11245#issuecomment-327325184,327325184,
