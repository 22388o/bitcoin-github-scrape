If that is the rationale, the RPC test could just pass in a hidden `-pruneafterheight` option, that seems to be better than making it dependent on the chain.\n\nBut yes let's not do it in this pull which proclaims to be a 'trivial' integer signedness fix.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7116#issuecomment-160566812,160566812,
