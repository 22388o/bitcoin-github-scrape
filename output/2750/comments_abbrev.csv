wtogami,2013-06-26T18:49:20Z,"Possible bug: In our testing we found strange behavior when nBlockPrioritySize was set to 10000.  Incoming zero fee transactions like 99XX bytes with sufficient priority would be accepted by nodes with nBlockPrioritySize 27000 but rejected by otherwise identical code with nBlockPrioritySize of 10000 with ""not enough fees"".  The mempool in both nodes had a few small 225 byte high priority transacti",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2750#issuecomment-20070978,20070978,
