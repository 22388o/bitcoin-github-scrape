    "body": "Well, I\u2019ve been reading the 0.12.0 release notes to learn whether the newest Bitcoin release (0.12.1) supports block relaying in pruned mode. If someone wants to upgrade from, let\u2019s say, 0.10.0 to 0.12.1, then he needs to check all intermediate release notes to know what features have been added. 0.12.0 release notes even explicitly reference earlier notes (on block relaying). Release notes are therefore a technical documentation, not only a historical document. My peer which connects to Bitcoin Core doesn\u2019t currently support `sendheaders`, so if I adhered to what is currently written, I would have to run the node in non-pruning mode, using much more disk space.\n\nBesides that, even if we assume that release notes are only documenting past changes (not \u201cbeing a historical document in itself\u201d), then reflecting those changes accurately has some historical value.\n",

Documentation where you have to browse back release notes to find why something is the case is the worst kind of documentation, apart from having to check git history (though arguably better than no documentatoin at all).\n\nI do think we need proper, up to date documentation about how block relaying works.

    "body": "I\u2019ve assumed implicitly that merging that change should also somehow mean changing the document on bitcoin.org. Another version being already sent by email would indeed constitute some discrepancy\u2026\n\nWell-written release notes may be very useful when upgrading and reference documentation may be useful in other cases \u2014 they are complementary. To summon a reference, [Django\u2019s patch review checklist](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/internals/contributing/writing-code/submitting-patches/#patch-review-checklist) states that both new features and backwards incompatible changes must have a note in release notes; the former must also have ordinary documentation and tests. Bitcoin apparently has no such policy, as pull request #6148 has neither documentation nor tests, but it may be a pattern worth heading to.\n\nOn the other hand, if release notes are generally not amendable and tied to a particular tag, then there is a question why after making a release they are still keeped under version control and moved to the `doc/release-notes` directory. They could be trashed as well.\n",
