laanwj,2016-07-11T09:12:34Z,"Hm, thanks for trying to help, but isn't it a bit too late to change 0.12.0 release notes? The release notes in `doc/release-notes` are an historical archive. People read the release notes before they download a release, 0.12.0 has been out for more than half a year, taking into account rcs, and is subsumed by 0.12.1.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8320#issuecomment-231681466,231681466,

If someone wants to upgrade from, let’s say, 0.10.0 to 0.12.1, then he needs to check all intermediate release notes to know what features have been added. 0.12.0 release notes even explicitly reference earlier notes (on block relaying).
