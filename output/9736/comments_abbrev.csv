jonasschnelli,2017-02-10T10:11:35Z,A thought: we can (not sure if we should) filter the seed.txt for particular service flags (like `NODE_WITNESS`).,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9736#issuecomment-278906075,278906075,
laanwj,2017-02-10T10:14:00Z,"Regarding the possibility: yes, the make_seeds script filters for bit 1 at the moment. This could be extended to others:\n```\n    # Require service bit 1.\n    ips = [ip for ip in ips if (ip['service'] & 1) == 1]\n```\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9736#issuecomment-278906608,278906608,
