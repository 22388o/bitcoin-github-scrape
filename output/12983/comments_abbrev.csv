For the purposes of the testing what we care about I just set `keypool=2` for a single node near the end of the test, but I could also just have the entire test with this setting, as it changes nothing about t",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12983#issuecomment-381364350,381364350,

It's possible to import change keys/addresses using `importmulti` (see the ""internal"" field); these aren't identified by having a change-like keypath. Furthermore, this approach will become even less reliable if it's possible to upgrade from pre-hd or pre-hdsplit wallets, as the old keys should remain being treated as change.\n\nYou could use being present in a",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12983#issuecomment-386468510,386468510,
