MarcoFalke,2020-06-19 23:44:34,"We use C++11 features such as https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/ios_base/failure, which is not part of clang-3.7, so Bitcoin Core can only be compiled with clang-3.8 (or higher).",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19333#issuecomment-646899427,646899427,
sipa,2020-06-19 23:54:54,Strange. https://clang.llvm.org/cxx_status.html says clang 3.3 implement all of C++11.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19333#issuecomment-646901302,646901302,
MarcoFalke,2020-06-20 00:03:45,"Hmm\n\nNo supported versions of Bitcoin Core can be compiled with clang-3.7 (see compile log below) and we haven't had any bug reports, so I doubt there is a user or even an operating system running on clang-3.7 today.\n\n\n<details><summary>compile log</summary>\n\n```\ngit log -1 && make V=1\ncommit 58ba7c314d552cea8cb024960a8504577aee586f\nAuthor: Wladimir J. van der Laan <laanwj@prot",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19333#issuecomment-646902616,646902616,
sipa,2020-06-20 00:17:45,"@MarcoFalke No objection to bumping this if it reflects reality - 3.7 is certainly quite old (though GCC 4.8 is older).\n\nHowever, I don't understand what's happening here. The `std::ios_base::failure(const std::string&)` constructor has been used in the codebase since 2009: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v0.1.5/serialize.h#L289. Could it be an ABI incompatibility issue?\n\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19333#issuecomment-646904570,646904570,

MarcoFalke,2020-06-22 10:59:30,Thanks. I'll deal with the clang-3.7 linker bug in a different pull. Let's focus here on fixing the compile failure with clang-3.8,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19333#issuecomment-647444651,647444651,
