    "body": "Good idea, some comments though if we're going to add this:\n- We should loop over _all_ configured proxies (IPV4, IPV6 and .onion) and try to connect to them\n- _It should still set the proxy even though it doesn't manage to connect to it_. Keep it at a warning, assume the user knows what they're doing. It can be an enormous security breach to connect directly outside the proxy.\n  - Also remember that proxies can suffer from intermittent failures. One failed connection attempt doesn't tell that much. But a pop-up / warning in log is nice.\n- Should this be in the init() or in the network thread, or even in its own thread? After all, I'm don't think that a slow proxy should hold up the startup process\n- Talking of slow proxies: is there a timeout? Or will specifying a non-existent host hold up the initialization forever?\n",

I see the current implementation just as a startup check, which could be extended to a proactive meassurement thread or sth.\n- As to init(), network or own thread I have no final belief, where this is suited best ...\n- There currently is just a 1sec timeout and if that passed the warning is shown.\n",

Take a look at init.cpp there is no loop so as far as I can tell we can only supply a single proxy via -proxy currently, which is used for IPv4 and IPv6 (if support is enabled).\n",
