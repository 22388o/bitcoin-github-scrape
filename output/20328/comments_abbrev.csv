hebasto,2020-11-06 09:49:45,Concept ACK. Why do we need to create tasks in such cases at all? Maybe s/`skip`/`only_if`?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20328#issuecomment-722986069,722986069,
MarcoFalke,2020-11-06 10:40:51,"I haven't tried `only_if`, I suspect the only difference is whether the tasks are shown on the website. Probably doesn't matter much as long as they are not run, which is the goal of this pr.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20328#issuecomment-723010150,723010150,
