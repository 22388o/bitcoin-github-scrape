laanwj,2014-12-16T05:11:03Z,"We test somewhere that sizeof(uint256) is 256 bits, so in principle these constructions should be safe. That said, using begin() is better code style.\n\n#5478 does away with external access to uint256's guts completely, which means big-endian can work. This change still makes sense for blob256 tho.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5480#issuecomment-67113359,67113359,

theuni,2014-12-17T02:59:27Z,"Yes, since the size is tested, I suppose these are always safe. I'll wait until after #5478 to mess with this.\n\nDo you consider this change to be worth making? Since it boils down to little more than style (as long as no storage is added to the underlying hash container), I'm fine with just letting it go.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5480#issuecomment-67270738,67270738,
