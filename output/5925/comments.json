So your number is still not accurate.\n\nThe point is, this constant doesn't do anything but prevent some integer wraparound error. I believe we could turn it into 2 billion, and nothing would change at all. Maybe we should :)\n",

    "body": "I would almost agree with the spirit of the concluding remark. In this instance, inaction is the least preferable option for the reasons cited. The answer to the often brought up theme of max supply ought to be unambiguos. Erroneously, the current constant fails at that, reinforcing the misunderstanding in absurd contexts.\n\nThe value ought to be either aligned with the supply i.e. there will never be more (but perhaps less spendable) than 20999999.97690000 mined major units (a truistic statement), or the suggestion inherent in the constant's name ought to be entirely abandoned (max spendable amount as is being implied). The PR advocates the former for practical reasons, but I wouldn't be opposed to the latter, once the references to the constant are disambiguated (unlike mined, spendable is not a constant). Perhaps both in this exact order.\n",
