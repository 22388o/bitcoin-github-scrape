muggenhor,2011-07-12T12:42:57Z,PS I'm not entirely sure what to do with this (in function 'movecmd'):\n\n> rpc.cpp:736:9: warning: variable ‘nMinDepth’ set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]\n\nThe most obvious solution would be to ditch the nMinDepth variable (and it's assignment) completely. If type-checking the value remains important this code:\n\n``` c\n    int nMinDepth = 1;\n    if (params.size() > 3)\n        nMin,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/399#issuecomment-1553932,1553932,
