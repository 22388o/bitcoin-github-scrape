ChainQuery,2015-09-03T17:45:55Z,Re-submission of #6609 - sorry for the double request.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6631#issuecomment-137525373,137525373,
paveljanik,2015-09-03T17:59:19Z,"@laanwj Continuing from #6609. Being explicit is nice goal. But in this case, setting default to 1 is much better because regtest/testnet is being used by people who should know what they are doing.\n\nWhen calling `generate`, they expect to generate some blocks. In almost all cases (at least this is my usage), one block. So after calling `generate` without arguments, they should reasonably expect",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6631#issuecomment-137528829,137528829,
ChainQuery,2015-09-04T02:13:47Z,"@paveljanik I agree that when calling `generate` the expectation would be blocks generated, however there are varying expected default values: some folks may expect 1 block , a wallet developer might be expecting 6 blocks, and a miner might be expecting 100. \n\nI like the idea of being explicit in this case, just my 0.02 bits...\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6631#issuecomment-137626904,137626904,
paveljanik,2015-09-04T04:59:42Z,"@ChainQuery after forgetting that miner won't probably mine his blocks using `generate` on regtest but on testnet, even miner has to test other counts of blocks being generated. But the common case in every case you mentioned is one. Generating one block is a typical use-case for every type of user you mentioned.\nA miner (see above...) will test 99 blocks and then one to see a difference.\nWallet",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6631#issuecomment-137649426,137649426,
laanwj,2015-09-04T08:44:04Z,@paveljanik For a user-facing UI I'd probably have agreed. But this is an API. Let's not have a bikeshedding discussion about a call that's only used for testing. It's not like adding '1' in a test script is a big drain on anyone's time.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6631#issuecomment-137680844,137680844,
