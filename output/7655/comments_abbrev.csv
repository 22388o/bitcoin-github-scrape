jonasschnelli,2016-03-09T07:36:27Z,No real opinion on that. I just think one clang-format file should be enough.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7655#issuecomment-194154834,194154834,
paveljanik,2016-03-09T07:40:49Z,"@jonasschnelli At first, I had the same opinion as you. At the second look, we should start somewhere. Qt/GUI part is more conservative as the rest of the code, so it will be a good start to put and test the clang-format there.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7655#issuecomment-194159608,194159608,
MarcoFalke,2016-03-09T09:19:52Z,> I just think one clang-format file should be enough.\n\nSo we are not going to keep the current formatting in `/qt` and `/qt` is going to accept the formatting of core?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7655#issuecomment-194199436,194199436,
laanwj,2016-03-11T07:33:36Z,"Due to the undesirability of breaking patches I'm not going to go along with any clang-reformat of the code at large. It's not worth spending too much time on this, there are much larger concerns.\n\nIt may make sense to add this for new code though. No strong opinion for or against adding this particular file.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7655#issuecomment-195233473,195233473,
MarcoFalke,2016-03-12T08:35:15Z,"> No strong opinion for or against adding this particular file.\n\nI think everyone is ok with either option. I'd just prefer to know what style is targeted for new code or what I should advise others to do in case they ask for feedback. No need to have a lengthy discussion about this, just express your decision by merging/closing this pull.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7655#issuecomment-195696672,195696672,
laanwj,2016-03-14T10:58:43Z,I think the best option is to target one (project global) style only for new code. Anything else is too much unnecessary complication for contributors.\n\nHowever when adding code to current files it makes sense to use the style used there.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7655#issuecomment-196258672,196258672,
MarcoFalke,2016-03-14T11:06:50Z,"Ok, great. Then this pull can be closed, I guess.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7655#issuecomment-196261314,196261314,
