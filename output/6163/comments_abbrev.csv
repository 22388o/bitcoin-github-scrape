jgarzik,2015-07-23T19:29:45Z,"Asking a dumb but sincere question:  why?\n\nThese parameters are global and constant to main, the module being modified.  This change appears to add parameters for little apparent gain.\n\nIs this an intermediate step to the code being moved to libconsensus?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6163#issuecomment-124218432,124218432,
jtimon,2015-07-23T19:43:46Z,"Well, these are actually the methods that are not required for libconsensus but still use Consensus::Params.\nThis is part of a bigger process of making CChainParams being explicitly passed as a const reference instead of using the Params() function all around. Basically that function is a way to hide a global that @theuni and I want to take out of chainparams.\n\nPassing it explicitly as a parame",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6163#issuecomment-124221145,124221145,
