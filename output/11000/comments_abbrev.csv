TheBlueMatt,2017-08-07T15:39:10Z,Thanks! Can you add a test to restart the node with walletbroadcast and check that it works? Maybe move the walletbroadcast tests from wallet.py?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11000#issuecomment-320698972,320698972,

TheBlueMatt,2017-08-07T18:47:42Z,"\n\n>You mean restart with explicit arg (`=true`)?\n\nCan do that too, just always a good idea to test failure and success conditions together.\n\n>Maybe only the one calling `resendwallettransactions`?\n\nI just figured if you move all the walletbroadcasting stuff to one place (wallet.py is already big enough) but don't really care.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11000#issuecomment-320748011,320748011,
promag,2017-08-07T21:24:26Z,"Thanks @jnewbery, comments addressed, and rebased with #11002.\n\nRegarding where to place the tests, IMO performance issues shouldn't lead to long-and-hard-to-follow-and-also-tedious-to-change tests. It also makes parallel tests hard to implement. Beside that, in this particular case, at least one restart must occur.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11000#issuecomment-320784914,320784914,
jnewbery,2017-08-07T21:59:24Z,"@promag and I chatted about this. I still prefer combining this with `wallet.py` to avoid additional test setup/teardown overhead (if it can be done in a way that doesn't make the test less clear or maintainable).\n\nI'm happy to defer to consensus opinion if other people disagree.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11000#issuecomment-320792508,320792508,

jnewbery,2017-08-11T15:38:21Z,"@sdaftuar - sure, this is very much a case-by-case judgement call. Perhaps Matt's suggestion of having a separate test for all the wallet broadcast functionality is the best way to organise these tests.\n\nIn any case, I certainly won't NACK any new tests based on my personal taste, and we can always refactor in later PRs if it makes sense to group things differently.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11000#issuecomment-321846632,321846632,
