jonasschnelli,2013-04-10T14:08:14Z,In my eye and also after tests there is no need for that.\nIt was somehow a hack which had set a empty dock menu.\nI'll also wrote a info to the dev who did code this why he did that (for 2 days)... no response yet.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2502#issuecomment-16176190,16176190,
jonasschnelli,2013-04-10T14:09:58Z,or... is there a chance that the client switches during the runtime from testnet to prod-net?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2502#issuecomment-16176300,16176300,

Diapolo,2013-04-10T14:23:07Z,But is the icon set as default anywhere then or can we remove the one for testnet?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2502#issuecomment-16177104,16177104,
jonasschnelli,2013-04-10T14:28:29Z,"the ""normal"" icon is set by the application bundle. But when the user start the app with -testnet, the icon will then be changed by QT (mac bridge code) in runtime. So the ""testnet line"" we need. But we once need it at another point in code (but this will be a new pull request once).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2502#issuecomment-16177494,16177494,
