domob1812,2019-03-04T07:09:35Z,"I'm not sure if that makes sense - checking the HTTP status code is a rather specific thing, which I don't expect us to do outside of this one test.  Thus I think it makes sense to keep the code here.\n\nBut if you disagree and see us checking status codes in other tests as well, I'm happy to move this to a more general place.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15495#discussion_r261940823,261940823,test/functional/interface_rpc.py
