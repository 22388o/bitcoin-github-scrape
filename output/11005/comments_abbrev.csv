eklitzke,2017-08-08T21:44:38Z,"If this is merged, I'll submit some whitespace-only PRs to clean up various files in the project (probably starting with markdown files, and then moving onto code if that goes well). I feel like it's not worth sending out any whitespace PRs though until this has landed, since otherwise there could be new regressions.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11005#issuecomment-321090707,321090707,
fanquake,2017-08-09T02:47:08Z,"@eklitzke Whitespace only PRs aren't likely to be accepted. Basically they disrupt other work and patches, and create rebasing issues, without providing much value. See the first point in the [dev notes](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/developer-notes.md). ""Do not submit patches solely to modify the style of existing code."" \n\nWe also have [clang-format rules](https://github.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11005#issuecomment-321137302,321137302,
eklitzke,2017-08-09T02:59:38Z,"@fanquake Noted. Although I did have problems with `clang-format`, since many of the existing files are not formatted properly, so running those files through `clang-format` caused needless code churn. In any event, this check will prevent the introduction of new trailing whitespace.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11005#issuecomment-321138962,321138962,

practicalswift,2017-08-10T13:47:15Z,"Can we ignore violations introduced in the directories of our imported dependencies?\n\nI'm thinking about:\n* `src/leveldb/`\n* `src/secp256k1/`\n* `src/univalue/`\n\nAlso, what about adding a similar check for introductions of new `\t`:s in files with suffixes `*.cpp`, `*.h`, `*.md`, `*.py` and `*.sh`?

practicalswift,2017-08-08T15:04:30Z,Nit: Use `grep -E` instead of `egrep` which is deprecated :-),https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11005#discussion_r131939447,131939447,contrib/devtools/lint-whitespace.sh

eklitzke,2017-08-08T21:26:27Z,"That doesn't hurt, although I think it's correct as is. Context lines are shown with a leading space when they have no changes, so a context line that starts with `+` will actually have a leading space. I'll make this change anyway for safety/clarity.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11005#discussion_r132037032,132037032,contrib/devtools/lint-whitespace.sh
