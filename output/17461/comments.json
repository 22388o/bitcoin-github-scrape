    "body": "@JeremyRubin: Thanks for your review notes! I fully agree to your points 1 and 2 (can't say anything about point 3 yet), they both actually stem from the fact that I can't find a concrete way to express the event of \"_node1 has received all txs from node0_\". As long as I don't know that all txs from node0 have been broadcasted, it is impossible to check that something is _not_ in the mempool on node1 (there could still arrive a tx in the future). That's why I worked with just waiting some time, which is of course ugly. Is there any other way? Can I somehow ask node0 if it has broadcasted to all of its peers?",
