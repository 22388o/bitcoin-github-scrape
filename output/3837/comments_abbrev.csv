laanwj,2014-03-16T15:22:43Z,For these cases (where you need a setup to have a balance) it makes sense to use a Python based test with regtest mode (see qa/rpc-tests/listtransactions.py for an example).\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3837#discussion_r10639795,10639795,src/test/rpc_wallet_tests.cpp
