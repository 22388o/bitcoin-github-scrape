I left in the old code that cleans up before returning as a belt-and-suspenders to ensure that this case is handled the same as before.  \r\n\r\nAs this is an essentially unobservable bug (outside of travis) to begin with, I'm not sure it would be worth fixing this any further beyond documenting the situation.",
