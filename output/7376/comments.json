    "body": "> So it's a spamming service. Not something we'd want to support.\n\nIt's an exploration into grouping transactions by OP_RETURN value, not meant for spamming :) Regardless, there are other use cases that would benefit from this. Essentially anything that uses OP_RETURN is currently incompatible with Payments. I'm happy to write up a BIP if this has any chance of going through.\n\n> Allowing non-zero outputs would be a bug as it stands, since BIP 70 explicitly states: \"If the sum of outputs.amount is non-zero, then the customer will be asked to pay the sum, and the payment shall be split among the Outputs with non-zero amounts (if there are more than one; Outputs with zero amounts shall be ignored).\"\n\nIt currently works as specified. If you give an OP_RETURN a > dust value, Bitcoin Core will process it (how I created that transaction on blockinfo). I can't imagine why this would be supported since it destroys value. \n\nThe two potential fixes are:\n1. Allow _only_ zero value OP_RETURN in PaymentDetails as I suggest.\n2. Don't allow any OP_RETURN scripts.\n\nRight now we have a situation where only OP_RETURNs with value are supported which seems like the worst of all options.\n",

On http://key.run I'm aggregating transactions sent to a particular address based on OP_RETURN value then displaying the OP_RETURNs that got the most Bitcoin sent to them.\n\nI probably _looks_ like spam because I haven't built anything useful with it yet and the amounts are super low because I've been testing with it. You could imagine real value flowing through a system like this though.\n\nI don't think this is the only use case for OP_RETURN but it's the one I have right now. In general it seems like a great way (at the expense of a prunable 40 bytes) to encourage emergent behavior within Bitcoin. I imagine any killer consumer app based on Bitcoin will be leveraging OP_RETURN.\n\n@luke-jr did you open the PaymentRequest I linked to up thread? Today you can \"spam\" the block chain with OP_RETURN values using the payment protocol. All my change does it make sure value isn't lost in the process.\n",

    "body": "@luke-jr I understand your point but I think you're not quite seeing what is going to motivate people to use this anyway...\n\nOP_RETURN was created because people were encoding data on the blockchain using ad hoc methods that weren't efficient. Even though some people (like yourself) would rather **no** data be encoded on the blockchain, OP_RETURN gave people a less damaging way to do what they were going to do anyway.\n\nNow with zero value payments the situation is the same. I _could_ shutdown key.run and call it a day since destroying value is suboptimal. Or I could just burn 6,000 satoshi per transaction and keep moving forward.\n\nAlso, from a pure design perspective I would say it's definitely a smell to have such broken functionality live.\n",

That's why it's important to  put it on the blockchain. As a merchant, you could message your user outside of the protocol but the message would be temporal, would rely on a great deal of trust that the values stick around and never change and generally encourage centralized behavior (to broadcast and store the messages). By allowing OP_RETURN you open the door for distributed applications that can't be built by removing the data from the Bitcoin protocol and handling it on another channel.\n\nTo go back to my particular use case, you could fire up your own copy of key.run on your machine right now and the db would be reconstituted from the blockchain. I could be hit by a bus and the service would continue uninterrupted (if anyone was using it :).\n",
