MarcoFalke,2016-01-31T11:33:13Z,Are there any internal or external links to `./COPYING`?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7445#issuecomment-177471699,177471699,
prusnak,2016-01-31T11:46:20Z,@MarcoFalke I fixed that. I haven't touched src/univalue and src/secp256k1 as these seem to be imported from separate repositories (where PRs are pending: https://github.com/bitcoin/univalue/pull/1 and https://github.com/bitcoin/secp256k1/pull/376)\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7445#issuecomment-177477505,177477505,
luke-jr,2016-01-31T14:21:52Z,I'm not aware of any such a rule... There appear to be other MIT-licensed projects using COPYING.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7445#issuecomment-177511207,177511207,
laanwj,2016-01-31T17:00:16Z,"NACK.\n\nIMO not worth the huge diff that this generates. And I've never heard of this ""rule"". For the legal standing it makes no difference.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7445#issuecomment-177550966,177550966,
MarcoFalke,2016-01-31T18:46:01Z,"I can't see how you ""fixed"" my concern. External links still give the [404 GitHub page](https://github.com/prusnak/bitcoin/blob/919a445362f12a25d761a786fbd73677c6078971/COPYING) for `./COPYING`.\n\nI think it is good enough to keep as is for now.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7445#issuecomment-177579979,177579979,
dcousens,2016-02-01T00:16:07Z,weak ACK as it is the default for GitHub repositories (AFAIK).\nMeh otherwise.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7445#issuecomment-177667481,177667481,
laanwj,2016-02-01T09:06:53Z,"> the default for github repositories\n\nBut we're not striving to be a default github repository, it is not a goal to shape the project after their preferences :-)\n\nIt's just not worth the effort, I'd prefer focusing on the zillions of actual user-facing issues that are open.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7445#issuecomment-177865849,177865849,
