    "body": "@ken2812221 isn't `NDEBUG` desirable for msvc release builds?  Without it `assert` statements will terminate the programs.\r\n\r\nUpdate: After looking over #15391 I now see the origin of the removal. I guess it's a design decision for the bitcoin-core programs but on Windows it's a real pain when bitcoin-qt crashes as the result of an assertion. It's very rare to see that type of behaviour on Windows apps. The preferred approach is to throw an exception and at least display a usable error message to users before terminating.",
