sipsorcery,2019-02-17T15:35:54Z,"@ken2812221 isn't `NDEBUG` desirable for msvc release builds?  Without it `assert` statements will terminate the programs.\n\nUpdate: After looking over #15391 I now see the origin of the removal. I guess it's a design decision for the bitcoin-core programs but on Windows it's a real pain when bitcoin-qt crashes as the result of an assertion. It's very rare to see that type of behaviour on Windo",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15431#issuecomment-464471324,464471324,
