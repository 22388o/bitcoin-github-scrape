theuni,2016-05-15T19:15:02Z,"Yes, this has been rewritten anyway. Adding to what @laanwj said, it'd be useful to have the code in the return so that the caller could react appropriately (for ex ""address type not supported"" should be a hint not to try that type again). In the refactored code, this returns a general type error (connection failed/proxy failed/etc), as well as a specific failure type.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8033#discussion_r63296532,63296532,src/netbase.cpp
