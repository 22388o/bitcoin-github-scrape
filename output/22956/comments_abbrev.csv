MarcoFalke,2021-09-13 07:27:50,Is there a guideline on which log category to use within validation? There is `BENCH` used for benchmarking validation. There is `VALIDATION` used for storage and validation. Now there is `BLOCK` used for `CheckBlockIndex`.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22956#discussion_r707071651,707071651,src/logging.cpp
jonatack,2021-09-13 14:51:10,Not that I know of. I published a doc at https://github.com/jonatack/bitcoin-development/blob/master/logging.md#log-categories that is an updated version of this [Bitcoin Stack Exchange answer](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/66892/what-are-the-debug-categories/66895#66895) in 2017 by @achow101 and am considering adding it to the RPC logging help.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22956#discussion_r707412281,707412281,src/logging.cpp
MarcoFalke,2021-09-22 10:47:30,"Is there a reason to not re-use the BENCH or VALIDATION category?

jonatack,2021-09-22 17:02:20,"We did that for instance with MEMPOOLREJ (1 line), QT (1 line), LOCK (1 line), PROXY (1 line), RAND (2 lines), COINDB (3 lines) and CMPCTBLOCK (3 lines), among others.\n\nMy thought was that VALIDATION is too busy and BENCH would be ok but seems not directly related to consistency checks (rename it?)  We could also rename CMPCTBLOCK to BLOCK and add it to that group.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22956#discussion_r714141250,714141250,src/logging.cpp
laanwj,2021-09-23 17:03:01,"I think a BLOCK category makes sense in the sense that ""block storage"" is separate from ""validation"". We have a separate label for it too.
