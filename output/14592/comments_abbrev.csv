ryanofsky,2018-10-29T13:52:39Z,"Should this say ""mempool state returned via non-wallet RPCs"" instead of ""mempool state returned via an RPCs"" since ""wallet may not be up-to-date with the current state of the mempool""?\n\nThis might be clearer if it started off saying there are different types of RPCs (wallet and non-wallet RPCs), and then talked about each type of RPC in its own paragraph.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14592#discussion_r228932951,228932951,doc/JSON-RPC-interface.md
ryanofsky,2018-10-29T13:56:49Z,"Can you give an example? Is this saying there that after a P2P response showing a certain state, there could be an RPC response returning an earlier state? Or is this just talking about incoming P2P messages that haven't been fully processed yet?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14592#discussion_r228934642,228934642,doc/JSON-RPC-interface.md
ryanofsky,2018-10-29T14:07:21Z,"Would add a paragraph break before ""The effects of all blocks..."" because this is now changing topic to wallet RPCs.\n\nAlso maybe begin the paragraph with a sentence like ""Wallet RPCs will return the latest chain state consistent with prior non-wallet RPCs, but not necessarily the latest mempool state"" to give the next sentences some context.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14592#discussion_r228938828,228938828,doc/JSON-RPC-interface.md
ryanofsky,2018-10-29T14:13:25Z,"What is a module? Could this be changed to say what a module is, or give examples or modules, or just avoid the term?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14592#discussion_r228941254,228941254,doc/JSON-RPC-interface.md
ryanofsky,2018-10-29T14:15:43Z,"Could this say ""chain state"" instead of ""chainstate"" to sound less jargonny and be clear this isn't referring to the chainstate folder?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14592#discussion_r228942253,228942253,doc/JSON-RPC-interface.md
ryanofsky,2018-10-29T14:19:41Z,"Is this just talking about the wallet? Or are there other modules? This paragraph is vague and confusing to me, and I think it might be clearer if it just talked about RPC methods instead of modules.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14592#discussion_r228943948,228943948,doc/JSON-RPC-interface.md
MarcoFalke,2018-10-29T14:57:23Z,"I wouldn't call it different types of RPCs, but rather each rpc is part of one module.

ryanofsky,2018-10-29T16:36:29Z,"Maybe I'm misunderstanding, but I think it's confusing to keep mentioning the mempool in this paragraph, when mempool consistency isn't explained until the next paragraph.
