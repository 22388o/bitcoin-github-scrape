By default, Bitcoin Core will use floating\n+fees.\n+\n+Based on past transaction data, floating fees approximate the fees\n+required to get into the `m`th block from now. This is configurable\n+with `-txconfirmtarget=<m>` (default: `2`).\n+\n+Sometimes, it is not possible to give good estimates, or an estimate\n+at all. Therefore, a fallback value can be set with `-fallbackfee=<f>`\n+(default: `FIXME`).\n+\n+At all times, Bitcoin Core will cap fees at `-maxtxfee=<x>` (default:\n+0.10) BTC.\n+Furthermore, Bitcoin Core will never create transactions smaller than\n+the current minimum relay fee.\n+Finally, a user can set the minimum fee rate for all transactions with\n+`-mintxfee=<i>`, which defaults to 1000 satoshis per kB.",
