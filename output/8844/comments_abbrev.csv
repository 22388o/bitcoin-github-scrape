Do you think it's worth considering?\n\nI personally think it's a good idea to have consistent terminology between block/sigops weight, but other people may not think it's worth the code churn.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8844#issuecomment-258387058,258387058,

jnewbery,2016-11-04T18:08:55Z,"Thanks for the input @luke-jr . I'd be worried that calling SigOpsWeight just ""sigops"" would be confusing, as people reading the code might think that it refers to the number of signature operations (it doesn't since the the sigops in the scriptSig and scriptPubKey are multiplied by the witness scaling factor, and the sigops in the witness aren't)\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8844#issuecomment-258506709,258506709,

laanwj,2016-11-07T09:14:30Z,"I think it is worth having consistent terminology.\nBut as for code churn, I could see this making it harder to backport things, although this could be backported as it doesn't change any outside interfaces.\nLet's ask who is working on segwit whether this is a concern @sipa @jl2012\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8844#issuecomment-258783002,258783002,
