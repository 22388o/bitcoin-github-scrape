laanwj,2015-11-24T09:19:45Z,"I agree in principle, but assertions on shutdown are extremely annoying. People google the error that pops up.\n\nThey tend to mask the actual error that caused the (sudden) shutdown.

Just take it into account.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7071#issuecomment-159211379,159211379,
