gmaxwell,2016-12-24T22:38:49Z,utACK.  My comment on reading the code was that we need to split the wallet and non-wallet behavior (esp for dust) but I see that your PR comment mentions an intention to do that later.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9380#issuecomment-269102964,269102964,

morcos,2017-01-16T13:44:45Z,"Removed translation strings for -debug options.\n\nIdeally this would get merged in time to keep the translation of `-blockmintxfee`.  I think it is ready for merge other than any disagreement over the name of `-dustrelayfee`.  I'm happy to change it if we agree on something else.     `-dustminfee`, `-dustdefinefee`, `-dustfee` or just leave it?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9380#issuecomment-272865244,272865244,
