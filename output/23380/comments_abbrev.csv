jnewbery,2021-10-28 14:07:17,"> AddrmanImpl::Add() has been appropriately modified to inculcate the changes. One doubt though: was there any specific reason for using auto ret = instead of bool ret = ?\n\n@shaavan - The idea was that all of the public functions could have a standard structure of:\n\n```\nReturnType AddrManImpl::Function(args...)\n{\n    LOCK(cs);\n    Check();\n    const auto ret = Function_(args...);",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23380#issuecomment-953880250,953880250,
shaavan,2021-10-28 14:11:49,"> In any case, I don't think it matters too much either way.\n\nMakes sense. Both `auto` and `RetType` would have the same functionality. But the `auto` keyword allows maintaining a standard structure, so it makes sense to use `auto` here.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23380#issuecomment-953887158,953887158,

I'm seeing addrman unit test failures that appear to begin with 2095df7b7bfcb; maybe there is an interaction with other changes on master that wasn't apparent in this branch, but I am only beginning to catch up with the changes of the past few weeks.
