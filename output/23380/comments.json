One doubt though: was there any specific reason for using auto ret = instead of bool ret = ?\r\n\r\n@shaavan - The idea was that all of the public functions could have a standard structure of:\r\n\r\n```\r\nReturnType AddrManImpl::Function(args...)\r\n{\r\n    LOCK(cs);\r\n    Check();\r\n    const auto ret = Function_(args...);\r\n    Check();\r\n    return ret;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich could then be replaced by a variadic template to reduce the boilerplate/repetation. I guess that would still work if `const auto ret = Function_(args...);` was replaced by `const ReturnType ret = Function_(args...);` though.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I don't think it matters too much either way.",
