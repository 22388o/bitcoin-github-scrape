jonasschnelli,2015-03-05T08:57:34Z,needs rebase.\n\nGUI and RPC looks good. Nice @cozz! Thanks for the rebase and rework @laanwj.\n\nThe new parameter for `sendmany` (json object) looks a bit as a overdose to me. A single boolean would maybe be sufficient. \n\nTested ACK.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5831#issuecomment-77328331,77328331,
laanwj,2015-03-05T12:31:17Z,"With regard to future extensibility, I like the idea of adding a JSON structure to sendmany. Should have been done that in the first place instead of the long-winded positional command lines for some methods. \n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5831#issuecomment-77355961,77355961,
jonasschnelli,2015-03-05T12:38:48Z,Agreed. JSON structures as parameter (or as optional parameter) would be more convenient and extendable. `sandmany` and `sendfrom` are also marked for deprecation so i assume main focus should be GUI and `sendtoaddress`.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5831#issuecomment-77356890,77356890,
laanwj,2015-03-05T12:40:42Z,"eh, who is deprecating sendmany? If we were to keep one send\* method, that would be the one. It is the most general send method.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5831#issuecomment-77357123,77357123,
luke-jr,2015-03-05T12:41:11Z,"@laanwj The JSON structure in the current PR only allows for a boolean for each recipient. Are you suggesting it be changed to a parameter object (eg, like getblocktemplate)? If so, I agree that seems like a better approach.\n\nAs far as multiple recipients sharing the fee, it seems more logical to be using an Array than an Object with only values of ""true"".\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5831#issuecomment-77357190,77357190,
