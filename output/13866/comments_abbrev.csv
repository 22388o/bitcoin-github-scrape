donaloconnor,2018-08-03T21:09:52Z,I find the &* unnecessarily complicated. Can you use utf8_string.data() or even the more usual c_str() instead that gives a direct pointer back. ,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13866#discussion_r207668411,207668411,src/utilstrencodings.cpp
donaloconnor,2018-08-03T21:10:14Z,Is this assert necessary? MultiByteToWideChar won't change the size of the string. ,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13866#discussion_r207668503,207668503,src/utilstrencodings.cpp
ken2812221,2018-08-03T23:13:24Z,"This avoid the unnecessary copy, `&*utf8_string.begin()` point to where the exact string data are. `c_str()` and `data()` is a copy of the string data.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13866#discussion_r207687208,207687208,src/utilstrencodings.cpp

donaloconnor,2018-08-04T21:03:41Z,I didn't spot the size= part before the asset. Sorry :),https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13866#discussion_r207719392,207719392,src/utilstrencodings.cpp
donaloconnor,2018-08-04T21:04:52Z,Not sure what implementation you are referring to but c_str and data have always returned the pointer to the internal data. Not a copy. Anyway it was just a nitpick. Thanks.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13866#discussion_r207719416,207719416,src/utilstrencodings.cpp
