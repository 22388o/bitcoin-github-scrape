ryanofsky,2019-06-12 16:59:39,It'd be helpful to give a little more context and say what motivates the change. E.g. is it a bugfix? security improvement? efficiency improvement?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16196#discussion_r293020292,293020292,doc/release-notes.md

ryanofsky,2019-06-12 17:33:38,Thanks! I guess I'd also suggest describing the context in the first sentence instead of the last sentence to make the release notes easier to skim. But this is also fine in its current form.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16196#discussion_r293033840,293033840,doc/release-notes.md
