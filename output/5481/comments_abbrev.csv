For example by returning the raw transaction in a JSON structure w/ some statistics like the fee from ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5481#issuecomment-67117184,67117184,
gmaxwell,2014-12-16T07:53:52Z,"Makes for a kuldgy interface in the RPC, however.   An alternative would be the RPC letting you specify the maximums (ugh, you may have absolute and per kb opinions) and then having the rpc just fail if it can't meet your demands.\n\nThis avoids having to have a callback, or a rawtransaction involving two phase protocol. \n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5481#issuecomment-67123975,67123975,
laanwj,2014-12-16T08:03:29Z,"I don't think it's necessarily kludgy. The two-phase protocol is useful for other things, too. E.g. as we discussed before, to create a transaction and lock the inputs but don't submit the transaction yourself, or submit it later (you'd also need a cancel RPC that unlocks the inputs).\n\nAlso the fee may not be the only criterion to decide not to submit a transaction after all.
