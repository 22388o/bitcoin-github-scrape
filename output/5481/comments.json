    "body": "utACK\n\nRe: maximum fees, a hard maximum would be a good precaution but it doesn't solve the uneasiness of 'send the transaction without knowing the fees'.\nE.g. the GUI handles that by showing the computed fee and having the user confirm the transaction.\nRPC could grow a similar functionality. For example by returning the raw transaction in a JSON structure w/ some statistics like the fee from `send*`, then having the client submit it (or even sign+submit) when it agrees. But ofc that's not a quick-fix kind of thing that we can add to 0.10.\n",

E.g. as we discussed before, to create a transaction and lock the inputs but don't submit the transaction yourself, or submit it later (you'd also need a cancel RPC that unlocks the inputs).\n\nAlso the fee may not be the only criterion to decide not to submit a transaction after all. As you say, even the 'fee' constraint may be interpreted in different ways. In my philosophy of doing as little as possible in bitcoind it makes sense to make the user evaluate this instead of build an array of possible checks into the server.\n",
