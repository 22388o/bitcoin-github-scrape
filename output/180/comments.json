    "body": "i was tired and almost going to sleep when i saw your merge message, apologies for my abrupt reaction. ultimately i care that all the documentation so far written in the commit messages goes into history as it has been reviewed here, else this huge movement of files will look too suspicious. i did not noticed the autotools (2nd in this branch) and thought your merge message was its rebase without the original message (the term \"manual merge\" is what confused me).\nagain thanks for your attention to details and patience.\n\ntoday i'll work on the second commit, the autotools build, and see if mingw32 can be integrated. In fact there is something strange still: autotools doesn't seems to honor environment flags and i want to look into it deeper, hopefully we can get rid of the hacky sed then.\n\nciao\n",
