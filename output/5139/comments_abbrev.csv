laanwj,2014-10-27T09:20:13Z,"Slight concern: os.remove fails when the file doesn't exist. There may be valid cases in which not all the files are created (ie, db.log won't be created without wallet).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5139#discussion_r19394067,19394067,qa/rpc-tests/util.py
gavinandresen,2014-10-27T17:34:31Z,"Not an issue; If we ever remove the wallet, we'll have to remove most of the rpc tests, because they rely on wallet functionality.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5139#discussion_r19421850,19421850,qa/rpc-tests/util.py
laanwj,2014-10-27T17:37:46Z,But some RPC test may start the node using -disablewallet?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5139#discussion_r19422168,19422168,qa/rpc-tests/util.py
gavinandresen,2014-10-27T17:59:23Z,"@laanwj : this is the cache/ directory setup code, it starts up nodes just for the purpose of creating an initial blockchain (so tests don't take so long to run). If rpc tests start their own nodes with -disablewallet, it won't affect this code.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5139#discussion_r19423982,19423982,qa/rpc-tests/util.py
