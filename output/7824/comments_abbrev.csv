jonasschnelli,2016-04-06T11:53:34Z,The uncontroversial commits of #7159.\nIs unclear how we allow opt-in-RBF over RPC and in the GUI.\nOne proposal would be to add a command `alterrawtransaction` (that could support setting the opt-in nSequence for all inputs of the provided rawtx. The command could also take care of increasing the fees).\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7824#issuecomment-206334659,206334659,

jonasschnelli,2016-04-07T06:57:14Z,"@dcousens Yes. #7159 contains booleans for `createrawtransaction` and `fundrawtransaction` to opt-int-RBF. Not sure if we want this or if we should go with a new call (something like `alterrawtransaction`). Also the process/workflow how to change the fee of a opt-in-RBF transaction is unclear (could also go over `alterrawtransaction`). And then, there is also the point where we once said we should",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7824#issuecomment-206723274,206723274,
