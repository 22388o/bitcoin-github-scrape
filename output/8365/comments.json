    "body": "Concept ACK, but to be clear I don't think we should merge a policy change like this for 0.13.  As it applies to all transactions, and in particular not just the ones being rejected under the current `-bytespersigop` policy, we should give users more notice on the proposed change.  (In the worst case, some transactions that are relayed under current policy of 20 bytes per sigop could conceivably see their effective feerates cut by up to 60%.  I'm analyzing some historical data to get a sense of how many transactions would be affected by this policy; current estimate: 0.8%, no stats yet on how much of an effect it has overall on those transactions.)\n\nMoreover I can imagine that downstream software might want to consider updating their notion of feerate to match what we do here (wallets, block explorers, fee estimators, etc), so we should give people time for that.\n\nOne nit: putting aside any non-linear optimization issues, there's another slightly suboptimal behavior here in how the mining package selection would work.  If a package is too big to fit into the block using the sigops-inflated size, but would fit using its actual size, then we should add it (as we're sorting based on feerate-using-inflated size, it's clearly the best thing for us to add).  However we're getting rid of the caching of ancestor package actual sizes, so we don't have a good way to do this.  I expect that this is a small enough effect that we don't need to worry about it now, but we should document it for the future.\n",

    "body": "@luke-jr I'm sorry to have misunderstood the original intent of the #7081 then, but that's the only thing it does in my opinion.\n\nThe code we had before #7081 produces nonsensical blocks when high-sigop low-size transactions are present in the mempool, resulting in lower fees than a miner could claim, and reduced transaction capacity on the network for a low cost to the attacker. Our code was broken, to the extent that both miners and the network would be better off patching their code.\n\n#7081 outlaws low-size high-sigop transactions, but it does not prevent hard-to-validate transactions or high overall validation cost. Those situations can still be produced by simply stuffing the high-sigops transactions until they are big enough to pass. This PR just treats such high-sigop transactions as if they were that big already. As a minor side effect, it removes the incentive for such an attack to in addition to disrupting capacity also bloat the block chain.\n",

    "body": "@luke-jr I tend to agree there, but that's a policy change that should be addressed by something like #5231 after public discussion.\n\nThis PR is a bug fix for the unintentional effect of making some formerly standard transactions nonacceptable. That's not something that should happen without discussion. Furthermore, this does not make anything worse: the spam you were trying to prevent in #7081 was never made impossible - just more expensive. This PR does not change that.\n\n#8364 however makes a related attack **worse**. With that you can have a low-accurate-sigop high-consensus-sigop small-size transaction attack that removes network capacity for an even lower price, as you only need to pay proportional to the accurate sigop count.\n",

    "body": "One nit, apart from the one I left already: I think it would be nice if in AcceptToMemoryPoolWorker, we had a debugging print to indicate when a transaction was being processed using a higher effective size, as sigops are not something we always have a record of when debugging.\n\nCode review ACK apart from those two nits, will test.\n\nOne thing I noticed is that if we were to increase the bytesPerSigOp default value in the future (from 20 to 50 -- I assume we'll propose that for a future release), then I think we should also reduce MAX_STANDARD_TX_SIGOPS_COST (currently 16000), because the IsStandard size checks operate on the transaction's actual weight without regard to sigop adjustments, and with the current value and at 50 bytes per sigop, it'd be possible to effectively exceed the IsStandard weight limit (400000) by crafting a smaller transaction that used the maximum number of sigops.\n\nThis isn't an issue now, because at `bytesPerSigOp=20`, the effective maximum weight that is achievable by sigops alone is still under 400000.\n\nIt seems that extremely few transactions are accepted for relay under current policy with sig op cost greater than 8000 (I counted 135 out of 8.7M in a sampling of historical data from February/March, the max sigop cost I encountered was 9644), so I don't think this would be an unreasonable change to propose, just wanted to flag it.\n",

This behavior appears to encourage spammers and has the appearance of condoning their behavior.  While I agree that some tweaking could be done to allow more legitimate transactions with more sigops through normally, removing this limit entirely done not seem like a sane solution.\n\nWith a spammer who actually cares about bloat, perhaps this could encourage them to lessen it slightly with this approach.  But first, they have no real incentive to do so if the end result is still the same fee.  Plus, an actual attacker has zero incentive to reduce the bloat as a result of this PR either way.  This still ignores the point that none of the spam or attacks should be getting mined anyway.  Again, as a miner, we should not be condoning spammers by giving the appearance that we're willing to accept their spam for a fee.  There should be no fee high enough for accepting a spam/attack transaction.\n\nNACK as this stands.  Concept ACK If implemented with the bytespersigop filter retained, since then I think this would have the desired effect of reducing/discouraging spam/attacks and also allows legitimate transactions that need more sigops to pay a higher fee.\n",

It's not really about getting your transaction relayed but about having miners construct more optimal blocks.  It seems silly to me to have the mining code be purposefully less good just because users aren't expecting miners to have more intelligent algorithms.  How do you defend that decision to miners?  We're not giving you better code because some users might be confused and not estimate their fees properly (including Bitcoin Core for that matter)?  Maybe you could make that argument if there was a huge impact, but sounds like its not?\n",

    "body": "Rather than lose the caching of the cost, how about we just change GetTxSize() to return the max of these two quantities?  This way we have access to the actual cost so we can write smarter code in the future, while I believe GetTxSize() is already used everywhere (but we should confirm) for feerate calculations, included size/feerate of ancestors and descendants, both in the mempool and in the mining code.\n",
