You may want to peruse some of my thoughts on why consensus is both critical, and why we should all be requiring consensus before agreeing to anything at http://bluematt.bitcoin.ninja/2017/02/28/bitcoin-trustlessness/.

The only way a UASF goes forward is if you idiots merge it into Core and promote it. What about the 50%+ support from miners for Emergent Consensus or at least some larger block size. This doesn't seem to get any weight around here but then some idiots on reddit are running nodes with BIP148 and all of the sudden we have to follow them because 'consensus'.",

I fear that this will cause Bitcoin Core's users end up on a fork. Merging that would be irresponsible for us as maintainers of said software.\r\n\r\nThat does not mean that:\r\n* I don't support SegWit. I do - I wrote most of it.\r\n* I don't support UASF. All early softforks in Bitcoin were user activated, and I think it's a perfectly fine way of getting new features.\r\n\r\n> its a softfork, it cant split the chain as both versions are compatible.\r\n\r\nSorry, that's nonsense. Soft forks are safe if a majority of the hashrate enforces the new rules. Segwit itself (BIP141) is designed to have very little risks of forking even if that's not the case. BIP 148 is not, and *will* fork users off who are not aware of the risks they are taking.\r\n",

Finally, with sufficient support to compel 50+% of miners (via financial incentives), BIP148 can avoid *any* chain split whatsoever.

    "body": "> there have been claims that BIP149 (or some other iteration of BIP8 deployment of Segwit) would be technically complex as it would need to ensure there is no conflict with the current generation of nodes with the BIP9 logic that would not recognize Segwit as being activated.\r\n\r\nThis can be mitigated in several ways. A new service bit for the P2P network can be set, and for blocks, allocating a new version bit for the BIP8/9 deployment should be sufficient.\r\n\r\nCorrect me if I'm wrong here. I don't see why BIP149 or a new deployment schedule for SegWit would be complex.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nRegarding the PR itself, concept-ACK, but I agree with people that feels there's no need to rush. \r\nBIP149 is _far_ less aggressive in that it doesn't require 100% of the miners to BIP9-signal for SegWit in the end of the period - the only way miners would be able to fork off once BIP149 goes live is if they intentionally include invalid segwit transactions, which they would not as they are non-standard for those clients.",

Irrespective of how any of us individually feel about a change like this, Bitcoin is a consensus system, and while its certainly up to people in the community to determine what they feel to be the consensus of the vast majority of users is, we should not be shipping code that does not implement the consensus rules of what *we* feel that consensus to be.",

    "body": "> When comparing the different potential distributions of hashrate backing of the different chains, non-BIP148 is strictly more unsafe than BIP148, due to the reorganization risk.\r\n\r\nOnly under some scenarios in which miners actually eventually switch over to BIP148 after its activation time a reorg can happen. I don't believe that will happen unless a very large portion of the ecosystem runs it.\r\n\r\nAs long as miners don't switch over to BIP148, _everyone_ running BIP148 code will be forked off. \r\n\r\nThat doesn't even come close to \"strictly more unsafe\". I'd say it's the opposite. Under any scenario in which such a reorg is possible, BIP148 nodes have already (possibly temporarily) been forked off.",
