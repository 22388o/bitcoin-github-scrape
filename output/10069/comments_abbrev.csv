laanwj,2017-03-24T12:49:52Z,"I think the underlying problem should be solved too. We shouldn't use `rawTx` and `rawtx` in a single function, this is the code equivalent of a minefield.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10069#issuecomment-289014108,289014108,
MarcoFalke,2017-03-24T13:14:31Z,"utACK 803e6a3. Agree that the underlying problem should be solved as well. As a first step you can get rid of the camelCase and use a single name for the variable. In a second step, the scopes could be limited to the minimum necessary. (Maybe refactor the blocks into separate functions?)",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10069#issuecomment-289019223,289019223,
