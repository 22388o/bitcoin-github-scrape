If you need to distinguish between errors programmatically they should have a distinct error code.

laanwj,2021-02-01 10:23:40,I tend to agree with @jonatack here. Shorter (and more *direct*) is better for error messages.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21040#discussion_r567711176,567711176,src/wallet/wallet.cpp
