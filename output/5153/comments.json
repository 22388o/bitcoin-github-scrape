    "body": "Yes, this change is about readability and maintainability (which includes being able to change a small part without affecting other parts).\nI used to use automatic style checking tools in java. Both Functions/methods longer than X lines and Y nested levels of flow control raised warnings saying that the function couldn't possibly be readable and asking you to refactor it.\nAfter the change EvalScript() is 274 lines and has 4 nested levels of flow control at most, which I think it's complex enough.\n\nThe groupings were already there, this is just the simplest (more reviewable) way to split the switch maintaining most of the code and just passsing opcode to those cases that were already grouped.\nIn some cases like OpEqual(), I've replaced the opcode parameter for a simpler boolean param (fVerify to do the additional verification when the opcode is OP_EQUALVERIFY).\n\nMaybe later OpNumUnary(), OpNumBinary(), OpCrypto(), etc can be split further without replicating code (I doubt it), but in fact splitting them in the same commit actually seems more risky and less reviewable to me.\n\nEDIT: Anyway, the tests are failing in some platforms so I've must have done something wrong.\n",

    "body": "In my opinion the benefits in readability in a critical part like this are underestimated.\nLeaving the current code structure not only makes later changes harder to review, it also reduces the number of potential reviewers we could have for those changes and the performance of those who are already reviewing these changes.Given that those resources are currently very limited, I completely understand the bias towards minimizing review needs in critical parts of the code, this conservative attitude makes the most sense.\nI consider this apparently meaningless change a great investment in precisely the resources that are being economized though.\n\nAt the same time, I also believe the risks are overestimated. \nThrough the use of version control tools like Git, I've discovered (mainly by contributing to complex projects including this one) that the amount of logical changes applied to a given codebase can be greatly minimized  with some effort to simplify the review process.\nThere are multiple possibilities only in this example: the operators could be tunred into functions first and change their interface (ie: replace an opcode param with a bool) later, operators could be turned into functions one by one, by groups, ordered by complexity in both directions...\nMany roads lead to Rome (not all of them if you're trying to avoid crossing an seas and oceans).\nI'm very open to hear more ideas about the best way to reduce risks while also reducing our costs in terms of collective time.\nRebased only splitting OpChecksig() and OpCheckMultisig() [the ones at the end to minimize the diff but, coincidentally, also the ones with higher levels of flow control nesting].\n\nIn any case, I also understand that pre0.10 is probably not the best time to have this discussion so I'm happy waiting for a better time and rebasing as many times as necessary. Obviously functional changes and releases should never be delayed to make refactorings easier.\n\nNonetheless, early feedback is always greatly appreciated, thank you @theuni @laanwj @gavinandresen\n\nIf keeping it open for later is a distraction, I can close it now and reopen it after0.10, no problem.\n",
