jonasschnelli,2013-05-10T07:18:35Z,hmm... `port install qt4-mac` will probably install the whole qt4 package. On line 47 of readme-qt.rst we write\n`- Download and install the `Qt Mac OS X SDK`_. ...`\nSo then the user might have qt installed twice?!\nCould we not just tell the users to install qt through macports?\n\nAnd yes. It's true. The Qt Creator downloadable from qt-project.org is only 64bit (even when it's labeled as 32/64 ,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2636#issuecomment-17707456,17707456,
Crinklebine,2013-05-10T07:25:54Z,"My pull was derived from building bitcoin and bitcoin-qt on a newly installed Snow Leopard hackintosh in Virtualbox. I did not download the `Qt Mac OS X SDK`. What worked for me was downloading Xcode 3.2 (the latest version I could find for Snow Leopard)  and ""sudo port install qt4-mac"". Perhaps the readme for Mac OS X should be split into OS X 64 bit and OS X 32 bit instructions? (It seems much e",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2636#issuecomment-17707650,17707650,
jonasschnelli,2013-05-10T07:28:06Z,"@Crinklebine i recommend not to split. Because the SDK downloadable from qt-project does not work out of the box (i always had to compile qt sdk) i would also say, remove the parts of Line 47 and change it with your information (install through port). Then we can also avoid making differences between 32 and 64 bit.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2636#issuecomment-17707704,17707704,

Crinklebine,2013-05-10T07:37:19Z,"There does appear to be some brew instructions in the current readme-qt.rst\n\n'. If using HomeBrew,  edit `bitcoin-qt.pro` to account for library location differences.

Crinklebine,2013-05-10T07:54:22Z,@fanquake  I see what you are saying. This should work on brew?\n\nbrew install qt\n\n@jonasschnelli Your recommendation seems right as MacPorts and HomeBrew both support QT install.\n\nP.S.
