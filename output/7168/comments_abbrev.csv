TheBlueMatt,2015-12-04T04:28:13Z,"I dont think this is true? sizeof() an array declared immediately previously should be the number of bytes allocated for it, not the size of the pointer (as it would be if you had passed it through a function without size).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7168#issuecomment-161872301,161872301,

dcousens,2015-12-04T04:36:07Z,We should probably just use `std::array` in these situations anyway... maybe\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7168#issuecomment-161873124,161873124,
