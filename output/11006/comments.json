    "body": "@laanwj - forgive me, I'm trying to piece together the history of changes to the shutdown procedure:\r\n\r\n- In #6719, you changed from using `event_base_loopbreak()` to `event_base_loopexit()` with a timeout. That was to make sure that the server shut down gracefully and didn't just drop responses to pending requests.\r\n- In #6990, you say that '`event_base_loopexit` was not doing what I expected it to. What I expected was that it sets a timeout, given that no other pending events it would exit in N seconds. However, what it does was delay the event loop exit with N seconds, even if nothing is pending.' I can't understand the difference between those two statements. That PR switches from calling `event_base_loopexit()` to call `event_base_loopbreak()` after a 2 second delay.\r\n- Later in the same PR, you say 'it appears that with libevent master, this issue doesn't exist.\r\n`event_base_loopexit` does actually do what I expect it to in the OP.' Looking at the documentation, if `event_base_loopexit` is called with a time value, then it will always wait for that long before exiting. If it's called without a time value, it'll exit after the next base loop iteration (http://www.wangafu.net/~nickm/libevent-2.1/doxygen/html/event_8h.html#ab89f0c907906f784fc80a3107016c3dc)\r\n\r\nSo I think what we want is to just call `event_base_loopexit()` without a time value. That would allow the current loop to exit, so shutdown should be graceful. I can't tell from the history or your notes whether you tried that before. Is there any reason that wouldn't work? (specifically, I'm just looking for your issue with `event_base_loopexit` was)",
