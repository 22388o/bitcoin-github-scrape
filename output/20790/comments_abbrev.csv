michaelfolkson,2021-01-03 12:28:29,"Seems like a clear Concept ACK to me especially if requested several times. I was unclear what was covered by the series of the PRs and what was covered by this individual PR from your initial PR description. Is ""It"" this PR or the series of PRs?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20790#issuecomment-753609720,753609720,
jonatack,2021-01-03 15:54:36,"Thanks. I'd like to work on things that people are *excited* about, e.g. ""Strong Concept ACK"" or at least a spontaneous ""Concept ACK"" or two. This proposal didn't make that minimal bar. The `CFeeRate` class could really use some love and I have a series of good changes written for it. They just don't seem to be compelling for reviewers at this time.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20790#issuecomment-753637402,753637402,
