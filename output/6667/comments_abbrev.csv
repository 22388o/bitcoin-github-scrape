laanwj,2015-09-18T04:00:08Z,"Not happy with the duplication, maybe we should simply move to debian's copyright file format and remove our own assets-attribution.md.\nThat said, ACK\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6667#issuecomment-141336739,141336739,
MarcoFalke,2015-09-18T09:06:57Z,+1. Added a commit to merge `doc/assets-attribution.md` into `contrib/debian/copyright`.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6667#issuecomment-141387428,141387428,
laanwj,2015-09-18T15:05:30Z,@MarcoFalke Looks good to me - though I think replacing the contents of assets-attrribution with a link to the debian copyright file would be even better. `contrib/debian` is not the most straightforward place to look for people that are suddenly missing the file.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6667#issuecomment-141477818,141477818,

MarcoFalke,2015-09-13T16:02:25Z,What is the scope of `debian/copyright`? Used for debian bitcoin repos? Which folders should be included in `debian/copyright`?\nActually there is missing more than just `mine.svg` (c.f. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/88f856a9e78a1440d9fdd8f9d5aa3cd034d66bf9/doc/assets-attribution.md#other )\nIs it required to duplicate those files?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6667#discussion_r39348953,39348953,contrib/debian/copyright
MarcoFalke,2015-09-14T17:03:03Z,ping @TheBlueMatt to clarify the scope?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6667#discussion_r39418506,39418506,contrib/debian/copyright
TheBlueMatt,2015-09-14T17:07:43Z,"It should include the copyright of anything which is installed, I guess? If the license does not effect the binaries or the files installed directly (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/contrib/debian/bitcoin-qt.install), then it can be skipped I suppose.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6667#discussion_r39419018,39419018,contrib/debian/copyright
