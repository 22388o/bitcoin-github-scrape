fanquake,2017-03-23T01:27:58Z,"If your going to start removing specific Boost functions, I'd suggest looking over the codebase and seeing if it makes sense to remove all usages in one go, to save lots of similar pull requests. It also make review easier.\n\nIn this case, we only have two usages of ```ends_with```, in core_read.cpp and netbase.cpp.\n\nThere are 5 usages of ```starts_with``` (the 16 in leveldb/ don't count) i",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10059#issuecomment-288590159,288590159,

fanquake,2017-03-23T02:47:25Z,"@tjps Yes large sweeping changes that touch many files, and disrupt many other pull requests at the same time, for little immediate benefit are discouraged. As you say, it's finding the right balance between hundreds of trivial refactors, and trying to change 100 files at a time.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10059#issuecomment-288601762,288601762,

tjps,2017-03-30T05:01:09Z,"I agree that not replacing it is urgent, this originally stemmed from a one-off from another patch I was working on.  Due to @fanquake's suggestion I looked at replacing all usages, and found cases where there was more than a single-character prefix/postfix match happening.\n\nI'm dropping this PR altogether, not worth the change.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10059#discussion_r108841240,108841240,src/util.cpp
