fanquake,2018-05-09T06:46:37Z,"@glaksmono Thanks for wanting to work on #12697. For future reference, ideally [WIP] PRs should only be opened when some code has been written, and you need help/feedback in regards to code or design decisions. We don't really use them for ""claiming"" issues to work on, a comment in the relevant issue is enough for that. (they will also consume Travis resources unnecessarily).
