jonasschnelli,2016-11-29T10:48:15Z,General Concept ACK but I would prefer moving the warning function in a new file (seems to be a misuse of utils.h/c).,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9236#issuecomment-263537875,263537875,

MarcoFalke,2016-11-30T22:01:58Z,"My initial thinking was to put all such ui related code into `ui_interface`, but I don't think this makes sense in the long run as the original scope of `ui_interface` was different. So I am fine with putting it in the new file, though I don't see why the new header needs to go into the consensus lib... I think common or server should be enough?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9236#issuecomment-264009736,264009736,
