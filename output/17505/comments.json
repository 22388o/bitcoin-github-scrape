That could be a good reason to try to limit the wraparounds in all code except where the wraparound is intentional (hashing code is a good example for where one would expect *intentional* wraparounds).\r\n\r\nThese are the places where we are currently expecting/suppressing wraparounds:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/397c6d32c8f8a20a3605ef0d51d159adc21fd125/test/sanitizer_suppressions/ubsan#L9-L44\r\n\r\nUnfortunately UBSan is a bit misleading in its warning message: from the warning message one gets the impression that unsigned wraparounds are scarier than they typically are in practice :)\r\n\r\nI think there is an `UBSAN_OPTIONS` setting that makes the warning message slightly less misleading: will investigate :)",
