MarcoFalke,2019-03-29T17:28:01Z,Let's see what travis' network-hdd says,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15696#issuecomment-478083312,478083312,
jnewbery,2019-04-29T23:15:17Z,This is failing on travis because the `mine_large_blocks()` is creating blocks with too-old timestamps. This only becomes apparent when running the test on slow systems. I have a fix i the branch here: https://github.com/jnewbery/bitcoin/tree/2019-04-fix-feature-pruning. Feel free to take that commit for this PR.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15696#issuecomment-487775830,487775830,
