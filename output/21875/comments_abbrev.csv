flack,2021-05-07 13:08:35,is that really a typo? invokable seems to exist: https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/invokable (and that site lists invocable as an alternative spelling),https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21875#discussion_r628196434,628196434,contrib/guix/guix-clean
jbampton,2021-05-07 13:18:12,`invocable` is in the codebase twice and `invokable` once.  Should I change them all to `invokable` ?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21875#discussion_r628202927,628202927,contrib/guix/guix-clean
