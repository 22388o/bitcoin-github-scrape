    "body": "This makes reorganizations unsafe and makes coins less fungible, as a payment to you may have been made by a coin whos ancestors was recently expiring, and then an otherwise innocuous reorganization makes all its ancestors forever non-confirmable, even absent a double spend.\n\nSimilar danger to reorgs/fungeability is why generated coin can't be spent for 100 blocks.\n\nI think advisory expiration would be greatly preferable, and then timed out transactions would just be double-spent before they are considered fully expired. This would avoid the reorg hazard, and also would avoid touching any consensus critical logic.\n",
