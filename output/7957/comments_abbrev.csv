mruddy,2016-04-28T01:03:37Z,"Neat, this is useful. I was trying it out and think that being able to use hex is a little easier. Maybe something like this:\n\n```\nif (sequenceObj.isNum())\n{\n    nSequence = sequenceObj.get_int();\n} else if (sequenceObj.isStr() /*&& IsHex(sequenceObj.get_str())*/)\n{\n    nSequence = strtoul(sequenceObj.get_str().c_str(), NULL, 16);\n}\n```\n\nI commented out the IsHex check because I think ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7957#discussion_r61361476,61361476,src/rpc/rawtransaction.cpp
jonasschnelli,2016-04-28T07:46:55Z,Thanks for the review!\nHmm... I'm not sure if we want utility function (hex->int) on machine-to-machine communication (RPC).\nBut no strong opinion.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7957#discussion_r61385539,61385539,src/rpc/rawtransaction.cpp
mruddy,2016-04-28T11:40:49Z,"Good point, I was thinking of only the GUI RPC console use (that's where the hex conversion is useful to me).\nIf your threat model includes hostile input on this interface, then the IsHex check could be used and the length of the string could be validated to be <= 8. That would likely be sufficient input validation. Adding back IsHex makes my first and third examples invalid.
