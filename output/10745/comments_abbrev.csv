jnewbery,2017-07-05T09:34:06Z,"I prefer #10698. This implementation causes an unnecessary API break for bumpfee between 0.14.2 and 0.15.0 (`replaceable` option becomes `opt-into-rbf`).\n\nYour feedback in #10698 was that we shouldn't change the argument names because it'd break compatibility with a derived project. This implementation is changing those names anyway, so it seems like that's no longer an argument against #10698",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10745#issuecomment-313052728,313052728,

morcos,2017-07-05T13:20:37Z,"I actually said I liked `opt_in_rbf` but that's besides the point.  What I most like is not changing the name now from something that has already been released (`replaceable`) and is perfectly good.\n\nTying up this much time arguing about the names is ridiculous. I don't really care what name we use, but seems like everyone other than you wants to stick with `replaceable` and I have actual mean",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10745#issuecomment-313100740,313100740,
laanwj,2017-07-06T18:33:59Z,"Sigh, agree with @morcos here, do we really need a competing PR for this?\n\nWe have been over this: `replaceable` is already in 0.14, so renaming them all to `opt_in_rbf` (which is only used in newly introduced interfaces for 0.15) is a more serious interface break than renaming them all to `replaceable`. Both result in consistency of the interface.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10745#issuecomment-313481763,313481763,
