sipa,2016-07-11T17:57:44Z,"I've tried to reason through what would happen if two subsequent blocks happen with a very small time between them, before the peer has time to respond to the getheaders sent as response to the first block, but couldn't find any problem. I believe that convergence would only fail in case every future pair of blocks happens with a sufficiently short time between them.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8305#issuecomment-231813348,231813348,

As-is, it looks like someone could just respond with alternating connecting/non-connecting headers forever since a ban score isn't set. I can't imagine any motivation for doing so, though...\n\nAlso, I don't think this should be allowed during IBD?

sdaftuar,2016-07-12T17:34:08Z,"Discussed with @gmaxwell on IRC yesterday.  He pointed out one drawback to this approach is that if we were to receive 2 blocks in short succession, such that the first block was still not valid according to the 2hr rule when the second one was received, then we would still fall out of sync.\n\nSo I'm going to push an alternate approach, where instead of just trying once to recover, we do the foll",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8305#issuecomment-232119978,232119978,
