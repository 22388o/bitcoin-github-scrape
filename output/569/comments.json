    "body": "I support the principal of coinbaser however I don't understand why setworkaux is part of this patch.  It would appear to have quite a different purpose and my concerns about it are outlined here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=46927.msg559622#msg559622\n\nIt would appear to be an incomplete solution for merged mining.  It does provide one of the operations necessary to make mm work but to my knowledge there's no complete solution based on this.  vinced's mm patches include a complete solution but the 'setworkaux' part is not exposed.  merging setworkaux with the vinced solution would seem to be best of both worlds option but since that's not what's being proposed I can't support setworkaux as a standalone patch.\n\nThe coinbaser part of this patch needs to be explained.  What output is expected from the coinbaser command?  In what format?  It's no use pulling a patch if luke is the only one that knows how to use it.\n",

I'm not ready to declare the other (non-coinbase-related) component required for merged mining \"done\" until there are some actual specs for MM with which to make a complete implementation.\n\nI agree the coinbaser output format should probably be documented. I'll see if I can get that added to this soon, unless someone else wants to pitch in. Eligius probably won't be using bitcoind much longer, FYI.\n",
