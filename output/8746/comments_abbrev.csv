laanwj,2016-09-19T14:38:01Z,"Concept ACK\n\n> Is it make sense to put this ""masked"" commands to history?\n\nI like this idea, it would also make the code simpler. Just have a list of 'masked' RPC calls, instead of having to handle the arguments per call.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8746#issuecomment-248011894,248011894,
jonasschnelli,2016-09-20T13:10:32Z,"Generally concept ACK.\n\nThough, I think we should add a flag (maybe on level of the `CRPCTable`) that could be used by the QT console to avoid storing a command-line containing one of these ""flagged"" methods into the local console history.\n\nThe flag could be labeled `exposeSecrets` and could be co-used for other purposed.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8746#issuecomment-248296651,248296651,
achow101,2016-09-20T15:18:19Z,@jonasschnelli @laanwj I will see if I can figure something out for with a flag or lists and not actually checking the arguments in each call. My C++ is not the greatest so I don't know whether I can actually do that.\n\nEdit: I don't think something with CRPCTable would work since the string goes straight to the console window before it is even processed by the rpc server.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8746#issuecomment-248333765,248333765,
laanwj,2016-09-20T15:38:55Z,"Moving this to some kind of table makes sense, however let's not use the CRPCTable for this. It should not contain GUI-level (or in general, client-side) logic. That belongs in rpc/client.cpp or the GUI itself.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8746#issuecomment-248340256,248340256,

achow101,2016-09-19T14:59:18Z,That doesn't matter since only the command (first in the list) and the timeout (last in the list) are actually needed. Anything else in between doesn't matter.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8746#discussion_r79410803,79410803,src/qt/rpcconsole.cpp
laanwj,2016-09-19T16:14:27Z,Sure. What I'm afraid of is that in the future someone is bound to add a command for which this is not true. The handling per command is a bit brittle.\n\nSo I'd prefer these commands to not be added to history in the first place.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8746#discussion_r79427996,79427996,src/qt/rpcconsole.cpp
