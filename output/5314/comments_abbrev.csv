ghost,2015-07-01T09:54:38Z,"I agree with @jonasschnelli in supporting this PR. For example, some have data plans that have limited day useage with unlimited night use, in such cases (very common around here) one would appreciate the option to pause access in the morning and resume after hours. Closing the app and restarting is always a scary thing because if it gets corrupted, you have to start from scratch.
