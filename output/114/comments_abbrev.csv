gavinandresen,2011-03-11T23:25:59Z,Cool!  Thanks for being persistent.\n\nTwo comments:\n\nThe appropriate copyright notice should be added to uiproject.fbp and uibase.cpp; I think building the next release with UpNP support compiled in would be a good idea.\n\nHaving both -noupnp and -upnp options (and tri-state USE_UPNP) is confusing and will cause problems if bitcoin.conf files are copied around.  I'd suggest something like (ass,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/114#issuecomment-862497,862497,
TheBlueMatt,2011-03-11T23:43:31Z,"Didn't realize Luke added -upnp in his commit, sorry.  The original intention was to have USE_UPNP as a compile option as to whether or not one would compile with UPnP or not and a single -noupnp where UPnP defaults to on.  \nCurrently the Windows makefile doesn't support any UPnP (some have suggested using Window's native UPnP library instead on Windows).  I think it should be always on by defaul",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/114#issuecomment-862552,862552,
gavinandresen,2011-03-12T00:53:37Z,Please start a discussion on the forums about whether or not UpNP should be on or off by default; I think you will find strong feelings that it should be off by default among Linux folks.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/114#issuecomment-862722,862722,

TheBlueMatt,2011-03-16T12:46:15Z,"That's the interesting thing about UPnP, for an individual, having UPnP on by default is bad - potential security problems down the line, increased traffic, etc.  For the network as a whole, having UPnP on by default is good as it creates more nodes which accept incoming connections ie good for network diversity in the long run.  (maybe even increased MAX_OUTBOUND_CONNECTIONS in the future)\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/114#issuecomment-880293,880293,
