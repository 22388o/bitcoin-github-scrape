    "body": "Cool!  Thanks for being persistent.\n\nTwo comments:\n\nThe appropriate copyright notice should be added to uiproject.fbp and uibase.cpp; I think building the next release with UpNP support compiled in would be a good idea.\n\nHaving both -noupnp and -upnp options (and tri-state USE_UPNP) is confusing and will cause problems if bitcoin.conf files are copied around.  I'd suggest something like (assuming we want upnp on by default for Windows):\n\n```\nbool fUseUpnp = GetBoolArg(\"-upnp\");\n#ifdef _WINDOWS\nif (mapArgs.count(\"-upnp\") == 0)\n    fUseUpnp = true;  // upnp on if not explicitly turned off\n#endif\n```\n",

    "body": "Didn't realize Luke added -upnp in his commit, sorry.  The original intention was to have USE_UPNP as a compile option as to whether or not one would compile with UPnP or not and a single -noupnp where UPnP defaults to on.  \nCurrently the Windows makefile doesn't support any UPnP (some have suggested using Window's native UPnP library instead on Windows).  I think it should be always on by default.  In the end that can only be better for the network as it creates more peer diversity (and maybe eventually increasing MAX_OUTBOUND_CONNECTIONS).  I will do that unless you disagree.  \n",
