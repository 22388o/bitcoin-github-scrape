promag,2019-02-06T19:32:01Z,Have you considered doing this on `ArgsManager` constructor?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15358#discussion_r254418095,254418095,src/util/system.cpp
MarcoFalke,2019-02-06T19:38:15Z,"I'd prefer not to bloat the constructor with stuff, since we've had countless initialization and memory issues due to that.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15358#discussion_r254420663,254420663,src/util/system.cpp
promag,2019-02-07T15:26:20Z,"Fair, you can resolve this.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15358#discussion_r254729427,254729427,src/util/system.cpp
promag,2019-02-07T15:31:10Z,"nit, how about this as a member, like `ArgsManager::SetupHelpOptions`?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15358#discussion_r254731855,254731855,src/util/system.h
MarcoFalke,2019-02-07T15:45:52Z,"In general the args are module specific (wallet, node, gui, chain, mempool, ...) so the args manager should not know about them. This is also in line with how we `Setup*Options()` for all other modules.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15358#discussion_r254738845,254738845,src/util/system.h
laanwj,2019-02-12T14:08:25Z,Agree with @MarcoFalke here. It is not the responsibility of `ArgsManager` to know about or hardcode specific options.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15358#discussion_r255967762,255967762,src/util/system.h
