laanwj,2021-02-17 12:32:26,Isn't `libboost-dev` an umbrella package forl *all* of boost?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21205#discussion_r577573369,577573369,ci/test/00_setup_env_native_asan.sh
fanquake,2021-02-17 12:58:41,"Yes. Note that it's currently already being installed, as a side-effect of either `libbost-filesystem-dev` or `libboost-system-dev`. However, once we are no-longer installing those packages, i.e post #20744, users will still need to install the boost headers, for multi-index, process etc. As far as I can, tell, `libboost-dev` is the leanest way to achieve that. There is no `libbbost-muti-index-dev",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21205#discussion_r577589838,577589838,ci/test/00_setup_env_native_asan.sh
laanwj,2021-02-18 12:25:19,"I guess that makes the answer to my question 'no' â€” `libboost-all-dev` is the umbrella package that I meant. `libboost-dev` is like ""boost miscellaneous"" which is okay.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21205#discussion_r578375173,578375173,ci/test/00_setup_env_native_asan.sh
