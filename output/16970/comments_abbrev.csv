TheBlueMatt,2019-09-26 18:52:30,Does this break on oldschool 32-bit ARM where int reads are required to be aligned (and I presume this includes 64-bit ints?),https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16970#discussion_r328773355,328773355,src/primitives/transaction.h
martinus,2019-09-26 19:08:42,"I don't think it's a problem, we are using uint32_t everywhere and align to 4 byte, so it should be fine",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16970#discussion_r328780043,328780043,src/primitives/transaction.h
TheBlueMatt,2019-09-26 22:55:03,Hmm? Isn't nValue an 8-bit integer? Or am I misunerstanding what this does?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16970#discussion_r328857974,328857974,src/primitives/transaction.h
martinus,2019-09-27 06:25:10,"yes its 8byte, but I thought it would still be ok because of how it's used in `Coin`. I guess I've missed something, I really need to set up travis builds... I'll close this for now until I figure out if/how I can do this correctly",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16970#discussion_r328927968,328927968,src/primitives/transaction.h
