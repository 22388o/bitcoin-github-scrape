jonasschnelli,2018-06-03T10:49:44Z,"The question is where to stop this... (change source code comments, variable names, depends compile system, etc.)\n\nThe next level (before the actual source code level) would be to change the ""API"", ... IMO there is only one thing that could be changed: `-uiplatform` from `maxosx` to `macos`.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13366#issuecomment-394153459,394153459,
giulio92,2018-06-03T11:46:16Z,"I agree with @jonasschnelli but we need to take in count that this can lead to some problems (softwares that use the current API naming won't work with the first bitcoin version including the new API).\n\nIf we agree on the API renaming, should it be part of a separate PR?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13366#issuecomment-394156554,394156554,
laanwj,2018-06-04T06:52:07Z,"Concept ACK. This is good for clarity. Please makes sure that the changes are complete; I'm not looking forward to 20 follow-up PRs that all change a left-over occurrence (I think that's part of @jonasschnelli's point too).\n\n> If we agree on the API renaming, should it be part of a separate PR?\n\nThat should definitely be a separate PR from one that makes harmless changes to the docs.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13366#issuecomment-394251947,394251947,
giulio92,2018-06-04T09:03:05Z,"I agree with you @laanwj, in fact I have checked the whole `bitcoin` project looking for `OS X`,`osx`, `Mac OS X`, etc. occurrences one more time and these are the files I have changed so far:\n\n- `README.md`\n- `contrib/init/README.md`\n- `depends/README.md`\n- `depends/description.md`\n- `doc/README.md`\n- `doc/README_osx.md`\n- `doc/build-osx.md`\n- `doc/release-process.md`\n- `src/q",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13366#issuecomment-394284870,394284870,

giulio92,2018-06-01T13:29:54Z,"I checked the official name for both the macOS releases and Mac OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion was renamed OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion after the macOS introduction. But I agree with you because it may improve readability.\n\nWikipedia for reference:\n- [OS X Mountain Lion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS_X_Mountain_Lion)\n- [macOS High Sierra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS_High_Sierra)",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13366#discussion_r192395911,192395911,doc/build-macOS.md
