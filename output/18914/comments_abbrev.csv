MarcoFalke,2020-05-09 11:41:05,"ACK d044e0ec7d37bbcdf10bbdb903b9119741c7297d, based on my understanding that adding `override` or `final` to a function must always be correct, unless it doesn't compile!?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18914#issuecomment-626162592,626162592,
vasild,2020-05-11 16:10:50,"ACK d044e0ec7\n\n@MarcoFalke that is my understanding too, except that if `override` is used when nobody is further overriding a given method then it is better to use `final` instead of `override`. This will compile. Even in this case it is better to have `override` instead of nothing.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18914#issuecomment-626800024,626800024,
sipa,2020-05-11 17:28:00,"It's my understanding that changing `final`/`override` can never affect semantics, only potentially change whether something compiles or not.\n\nIn addition, `override` imples `virtual`, and `final` implies `override`, so it should never be needed to specify more than one of these 3.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18914#issuecomment-626841976,626841976,
