MarcoFalke,2021-11-29 08:22:21,"> The long-term idea is to move from uint8_t to std::byte everywhere?\n\nYes, in places where raw bytes are handled. Though, this is mostly a style question, so there is no rush or need to switch existing code. For example, #23438 updates serialize to use Spans, and updating to `std::byte` at the same time was ""free"".",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23595#issuecomment-981390885,981390885,

It would be incredibly difficult to port bitcoin to a system that doesn't have 8-bit memory units. `uint8_t` just makes sense to me in that regard.\nBut no problem with making some code more general when it comes for free.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23595#issuecomment-981526986,981526986,
sipa,2021-11-30 04:37:16,"@laanwj I don't think the point is generality; we very much assume that a byte is 8 bits all over the place. It's more a type safety thing: `std::byte` indicates we're just talking about bytes, and not about numbers. They don't automatically get converted to ints or bools, for example.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23595#issuecomment-982278471,982278471,
