pierreN,2020-04-15 21:20:56,"Since you create accessors for `m_names` (`GetName`, `GetFirstName`), it would make sense to make `m_names` private, no?\n\nPlus this would allow you to have a function `GetNames` similar to:\n```\nstd::vector<std::string> RPCArg::GetNames() const\n{\n    std::vector<std::string> names;\n    boost::split(names, m_names, boost::is_any_of(""|""));\n    return names;\n}\n```\nand do here mor",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18607#discussion_r409140885,409140885,src/rpc/util.cpp

MarcoFalke,2020-04-16 12:38:33,"`RPCArg` is a `struct`, because it was meant to be a stupid class to only hold data and not have complicated member functions. I see that with the name aliases this is no longer true. I think it can be made a class and the `GetNames` utility can be added. Though, I will leave this pull as is for now, because currently `GetNames` is only used in this one place. And just in-lining it will yield the ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18607#discussion_r409521777,409521777,src/rpc/util.cpp
