luke-jr,2016-05-06T03:57:26Z,You should be able to just click the heading you want to sort by... maybe this makes sense as a default though.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8014#issuecomment-217342516,217342516,

jonasschnelli,2016-05-14T13:00:04Z,"On regtest this can result in a strange table ordering. If you generate a couple of blocks, mostly some (or all) of them are generated during the same second which makes them equal for the date sort order. My tests showed me, that I had transactions table entries (coinbase) with more confirmations on top of entries with fever confirmations.\n\nI hope this is a regtest only problem (I can't imagine",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8014#issuecomment-219219144,219219144,
MarcoFalke,2016-05-14T13:06:37Z,> Conflicted transactions can get stuck at the top. This fixes that.\n\nWouldn't it be better to give an option to wipe such transactions from the db (and thus gui) entirely?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8014#issuecomment-219219446,219219446,
jonasschnelli,2016-05-14T13:19:16Z,You can use the new abandon function (context menu) https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7707. But it will not remove the transaction. Removing is somehow against the bookkeeping rules. But I agree it could be useful sometimes.\n\nFor this PR: I think it is useful. But confirmation count should be the 2nd sort attribute.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8014#issuecomment-219220000,219220000,
Tyler-Hardin,2016-05-16T01:51:03Z,"@jonasschnelli there's no builtin way to do that. I could add a method to do it, but I'm not sure how to expose the functionality API-wise.\n\nWhat do you think about having a `sortSecondary(int col, Qt::SortOrder ord)` method that is called on a `TransactionFilterProxy` that has already been sorted by the primary key. This is the simplest way to implement it that I can think of.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8014#issuecomment-219332979,219332979,
