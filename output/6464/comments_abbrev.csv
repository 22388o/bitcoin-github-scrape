jgarzik,2015-07-23T19:02:46Z,concept ACK - will review & test in depth\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6464#issuecomment-124212442,124212442,
luke-jr,2015-07-23T20:06:00Z,Prioritisations should never be removed until a transaction is mined. It's intentionally not on CTxMemPoolEntry because we may not have (or be willing to accept) the transaction until after prioritising it. Although it does make sense to remove the entry if a _conflicting_ transaction is confirmed.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6464#issuecomment-124225524,124225524,
sipa,2015-07-24T17:58:42Z,Agree with @luke-jr. @casey can you move the remove call to CTxMemPool::removeForBlock ?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6464#issuecomment-124599928,124599928,
casey,2015-07-24T18:03:28Z,"@luke-jr @sipa In that case, shouldn't the existing call to ClearPrioritisation in CTxMemPool::removeForBlock be left where it is, and an additional one be added to CTxMemPool::removeConflicts, to clear the priority of  conflicting transactions?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6464#issuecomment-124600873,124600873,
casey,2015-08-03T19:50:33Z,So I think in that case it's just a simple one line change to clear prioritizations when a conflicting transaction is mined.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6464#issuecomment-127386151,127386151,
sipa,2015-08-04T17:34:38Z,Seems reasonable to me.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6464#issuecomment-127686711,127686711,
