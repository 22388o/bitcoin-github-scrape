sipa,2019-02-27T20:29:07Z,"Given that both `importmulti` and `deriveaddress` are new in 0.18, would it be worthwhile to make it compatible with `scantxoutset` (which uses a parameter called ""range"", but not start position)?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15496#issuecomment-468017933,468017933,

sipa,2019-02-27T20:34:19Z,"@instagibbs Well clearly `importmulti` should support a range that doesn't start at 0. My suggestion is whether we want to consider naming the argument ""range"" rather than stop or end, to be compatible with `scantxoutset` (which is already in 0.17). What about `""range"" : [start,stop]` for start-stop, and `""range"" : stop` for 0-stop?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15496#issuecomment-468019628,468019628,
