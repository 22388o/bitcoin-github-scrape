While this is probably a good rule for incorrect style in a single line, if a whole block is wrongly indented (e.g. 3 spaces vs 4 spaces), it makes editing that block harder because your editor might re-indent the whole block and you'd have to manually adjust the diff afterwar",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22562#issuecomment-888100107,888100107,

My eyes are hurt every time I encounter inconsistencies and it is indeed annoying when the editor automatically formats it in another way.\n\nOTOH it is in a clear violation of the guidelines, so maybe just remove that sentence from `doc/developer-notes.md` or clarify it with what you wrote above.\n\nIdeally I would go for clang-format'ing all source files (scr",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22562#issuecomment-888158540,888158540,
