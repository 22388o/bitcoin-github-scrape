While this is probably a good rule for incorrect style in a single line, if a whole block is wrongly indented (e.g. 3 spaces vs 4 spaces), it makes editing that block harder because your editor might re-indent the whole block and you'd have to manually adjust the diff afterward to restore the incorrect indentation.

My eyes are hurt every time I encounter inconsistencies and it is indeed annoying when the editor automatically formats it in another way.\r\n\r\nOTOH it is in a clear violation of the guidelines, so maybe just remove that sentence from `doc/developer-notes.md` or clarify it with what you wrote above.\r\n\r\nIdeally I would go for clang-format'ing all source files (scripted diff) at once and making sure that future violations paint the CI red. There is `// clang-format off` for exceptions. This would make style comments during code review unnecessary.

    "body": "I can certainly change this to being done via a scripted-diff to include **both** the indentation and the pointer/reference alignment inconsistencies in one go for this specific file. I originally didn't include the pointer/reference alignment change here as that inconsistency is more wide-spread throughout the codebase (and not explicitly mentioned in `doc/developer-notes.md`, but set as a rule in `src/.clang-format`), but the indentation inconsistency is isolated to this single file and **is** explicitly mentioned in `doc/developer-notes.md.\r\n\r\nThere also seems to be a conflict between the `doc/developer-notes.md` (as quoted above) and the `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.MD` with regard to style-only refactoring submissions: <https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blame/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md#L28-L35>\r\n\r\n> * Refactoring changes are only accepted if they are required for a feature or\r\n  bug fix or otherwise improve developer experience significantly. For example,\r\n  most \"code style\" refactoring changes require a thorough explanation why they\r\n  are useful, what downsides they have and why they *significantly* improve\r\n  developer experience or avoid serious programming bugs. Note that code style\r\n  is often a subjective matter. Unless they are explicitly mentioned to be\r\n  preferred in the [developer notes](/doc/developer-notes.md), stylistic code\r\n  changes are usually rejected.\r\n\r\nI felt that fixing the indentation inconsistency would improve the developer experience overall by providing consistency. I thought my explanation of the situation was through, and, at least for the indentation inconsistency, it is explicitly mentioned to be preferred in the `doc/developer-notes.md` file.\r\n\r\n@vasild in an ideal world, I agree that a single scripted-diff to clang-format the entire source tree would indeed be a \"fix to fix all fixes\" type solution, but past experiences lead me to believe that it would undoubtedly result in many many conflicts with other open PRs and only serve to drag out, complicate, or even indefinitely stall the review process. this is why I wanted to make this a narrow-focused PR on the single file that violates the indentation preference.",

    "body": "> Ideally I would go for clang-format'ing all source files (scripted diff) at once and making sure that future violations paint the CI red\r\n\r\nI tried something like this in #6839, which was closed.

Also a red CI for \"wrong\" format is problematic by itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nSee also my reply template:\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution. While this stylistic change makes sense on its own, it comes at a cost and risk for the project as a whole. The weak motivation for the change does not justify the burden that it places on the project. A burden could be any of the following:\r\n\r\n* Time spent on review\r\n* Accidental introduction of bugs\r\n* (Silent) merge conflicts, either in the branch or a backport branch. Those conflicts demand further developer and reviewer time or introduce bugs.\r\n\r\nFor more information about refactoring changes and stylistic cleanup, see\r\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#refactoring\r\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md\r\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/15465\r\n\r\nGenerally, if the style is not mentioned nor enforced by the developer notes, we leave it up to the original author to pick whatever fits them best personally and then leave it that way until the line is touched for other reasons.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have any questions.",
