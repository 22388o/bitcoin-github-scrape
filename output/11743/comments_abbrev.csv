promag,2017-11-22T17:28:08Z,"Come on, I think I made a valid point, and if it wasn't clear at least give a chance to explain. Beside it only had one ACK. Test code should follow the same review rules as the other right?\n\nMy point is that renaming w3 to w would be enough, or am I wrong? It is slower in the sense that at least more RPC calls are (unnecessarily) made.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11743#issuecomment-346420464,346420464,
MarcoFalke,2017-11-22T17:58:54Z,"Yes, you are right that renaming w3 to w achieves the goal in a different way. However, I don't think we should be counting the number of rpc calls, when optimizing the functional test suite for speed. Especially, since some calls like `getwalletinfo` or `getnewaddress` are trivial computationally wise.\n\nI'd understand your concern in case, let's say, we called `generate(100)` or added a new n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11743#issuecomment-346428547,346428547,

MarcoFalke,2017-11-22T18:46:15Z,"@ryanofsky As I understand, the potential bug is that a call to ""w"" matches any of ""w1"", ""w2"", ... , because the one wallets' name is a prefix of another wallet. Alternatively, a call to wallet ""w3"" will instead call to ""w"", because or logic might only compare up to the length of the shortest wallet file name.\n\nOverall this should be testing our ""endpoint-to-wallet"" method.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11743#issuecomment-346440512,346440512,
