    "body": "Yes, you are right that renaming w3 to w achieves the goal in a different way. However, I don't think we should be counting the number of rpc calls, when optimizing the functional test suite for speed. Especially, since some calls like `getwalletinfo` or `getnewaddress` are trivial computationally wise.\r\n\r\nI'd understand your concern in case, let's say, we called `generate(100)` or added a new node to the topology (thus having to wait for startup, chain sync and shutdown).\r\n\r\nRe: Review on test pulls.\r\nIn the past there have been many test pulls sitting for months, not gaining any review (e.g. #11182, #10711, #10099). Instead, their author had to rebase every couple of weeks. To be fair those pulls were more involved than this one. And for rather simple pulls, such as this one, I try to merge quickly. Two utACK or one tested ACK should be sufficient. Again, your feedback was not ignored, but I didn't consider it critical to hold up the merge. If I changed the pull to address your feedback, review needed to be start all over again, equivalent to creating a new pull request. Personally, I don't think that would be worth it. Though, if you feel strongly about the feedback, you are very welcome to create a patch for it and submit it for review.",
