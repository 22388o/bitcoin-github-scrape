It, however, dies sometimes and fails to test properly.

Diapolo,2014-02-21T08:19:09Z,That's one of those magic numbers that we should perhaps constantify?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3718#discussion_r9938913,9938913,src/script.cpp
laanwj,2014-02-21T08:50:11Z,It may be that using the explicit numbers here actually makes the rules more readable than using a named constant. OTOH some form of documentation as to why certain numbers were chosen in the source code would be useful.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3718#discussion_r9939421,9939421,src/script.cpp
