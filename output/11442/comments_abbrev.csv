laanwj,2017-10-09T11:26:58Z,"> - The boost package installed via pkg_add now seems to work correctly. So we shouldn't require manual building + patching.\n\n**[gcc]** I can confirm this. Good to know! Have run the `make check` successfully, as well as `test/functional/test_runner.py` as well as synced a testnet node part of the way w/ their boost package. This does go from boost 1.64 to 1.58, but I don't think that's so bad",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11442#issuecomment-335130705,335130705,
