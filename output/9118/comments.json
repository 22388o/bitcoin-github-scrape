It was tricky to get right the first time, and I'd like to see a compelling argument why this functionality wouldn't be necessary in future improvements to fee estimation before we remove it.\n\nI agree that if it stays unused, it should eventually be removed as the code is harder to understand with it, but I see no harm in leaving it around for a release or two until we see if there are further changes to fee estimation happening.\n",
