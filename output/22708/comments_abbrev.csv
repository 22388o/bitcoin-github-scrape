laanwj,2021-08-16 14:52:42,"Concept ACK. Thanks for working on this.\n\n> Adding a hard dependency on Mesa's OpenGL ES2 driver for building the dependencies is kind of meh here.\n\nSpeaking of which, does this add any `NEEDED` libraries to the `bitcoin-qt` binary? (e.g., does this pass the symbols check)? Or does it figure out that wayland/EGL/OpenGL ES2 is optional at least at run time, if not at build time?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22708#issuecomment-899575281,899575281,
fanquake,2021-08-17 03:56:18,"> Speaking of which, does this add any NEEDED libraries to the bitcoin-qt binary?\n\nYes it does. This change in it's current state adds the following runtime dependencies to `bitcoin-qt`:\n```bash\nqt/bitcoin-qt: NEEDED library libwayland-egl.so.1 is not allowed\nqt/bitcoin-qt: NEEDED library libGLESv2.so.2 is not allowed\nqt/bitcoin-qt: NEEDED library libwayland-cursor.so.0 is not allowed",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22708#issuecomment-899973897,899973897,
