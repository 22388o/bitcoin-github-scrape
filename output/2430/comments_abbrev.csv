da2x,2013-04-01T09:28:38Z,"@rebroad the patch continues to use Boost for creating the directory cross-platform. What is added is for Unix systems to set the permissions more restrictive after creating the patch. This should also upgrade permissions for existing users, where as doing a new `mkdir` will not.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2430#issuecomment-15709814,15709814,
Diapolo,2013-04-01T11:51:30Z,You mention `boost::filesystem::permissions()` why not include code with `#if BOOST_VERSION >= 104900`?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2430#issuecomment-15712856,15712856,
laanwj,2013-04-01T14:42:37Z,@rebroad This is strange. We _are_ setting the umask (in init.cpp).  Also my .bitcoin filter has the right permissions even without this patch.\n\n@Aeyoun Are you sure it manages to create the directory with wrong permissions? Can you reproduce this?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2430#issuecomment-15718013,15718013,
