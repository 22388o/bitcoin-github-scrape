    "body": "> I don't think this is urgent to fix and incentivizes using the mempool as working space for negotiating smaller witnesses, rather than attempting to produce a smaller signature on first broadcast.\r\n\r\nI think the notion of first broadcast doesn't hold when you have multiple-party involved with alternatives spending paths and so potential concurrent broadcasts. Parties can't produce smaller signatures because key distribution across script branches encodes a policy, it can be either Alice or Bob+Caroll+Dave, where Alice has a higher level of privileges. As a practical example you might have pre-signed vault transactions, like https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2020-April/017793.html\r\n\r\n> Further, this opens up potential attacks where you can make malleable smaller and smaller witnesses and keep resubmitting to boost feerate or something.\r\n\r\nYou're still liable to RBF rules compliance, especially rule 4 on incremental relay fee ?\r\n\r\n> where you might convince me that it's a problem is if Alice and Bob are doing a payjoin or something, and then Bob changes his witness to be an even bigger one and then broadcasts, locking Alice onto a lower fee rate for the transaction.\r\n\r\nAs a first step you should avoid to introduce witness malleability if parties are distrusted, and currently as I mentioned it won't likely propagate due to default mempool settings. But yes if we change it in the future, it would be a limited guardrail for this kind of scenario.\r\n\r\nThere is no urgency to fix, it's more making consistent our relay wtxid-policy with our mempool one.\r\n",

    "body": ">  To do this correctly, you'd also want to not evict all the descendants of the replaced transaction in situations like this, which I think means more special cased mempool acceptance logic.\r\n\r\nI agree in-place substitution while conserving chain of transactions would be better bandwidth-wise. But that would require special RBF rules to handle it and I think it's better to strictly bound to our current RBF rules to make it easier to reason on. We already have the same issue with someone replacing a parent tx with a new txid and advertising again a chain of transaction paying the same outputs. Cheap RBF replacement should be addressed on its own, this PR doesn't pretend to make it better or worse ?\r\n\r\n> Is there any application out there that would expect to use this behavior? \r\n\r\nBeyond preventing abuse for potential coinjoin/payjoin/vaults and easing future usage for taproot branches, as of today there is the practical usage of selecting your best-feerate witness among a set of valid ones. I don't think a lot of users have yet this mental model but I expect this to change with wider adoption of Miniscript.\r\n\r\nUpdated with better comment/logs.

    "body": "@ajtowns Good call, took your suggestion. Initially called it \"wtxid-acceptance\" as this is literally what this PR does, evaluating an already-present utxo-spend candidate on wtxid rather than txid. In practice, I agree that txid is what matters, like evaluating descendants limits. Note, for implementation simplicity, it does evict descendants from mempool, we can implement in-place substitution as a follow-up if it feels needed.\r\n\r\nFor the taproot hint, I think that rational holds, as from the miner viewpoint you want to increase feerate per weight unit. I don't think that effective memory-space of these weight units is a burden for miner mempools.",

I can imagine there could be lots of reasons why behavior like this would not actually take place in practice.\r\n\r\nWhile opening this PR, I thought too it was a theoretical concern, but [reviewing the DLC specs](https://github.com/discreetlogcontracts/dlcspecs/pull/51#discussion_r467589135) last week, such protocol would be vulnerable to witness weight inflation discussed here. And a honest participant can't rely on RBF as it's easy for a malicious party to attach a high-absolute-fee, low-feerate chain of transactions to its change output \r\n\r\nOf course you can adopt carve-out mechanism and ensure you don't have more than one immediately spendable output by party but this come with far less protocol flexibility and you might loss few blocks between initial broadcast and trigger of your fee-bump.\r\n\r\nI agree that change advocated in this PR won't fix it without further modifications to our RBF policy but it's at least a minimal prerequisite. \r\n\r\nOr do you think we should first have a broader discussion on the mental model that higher protocol designers should adopt with regards to our mempool/relay policy ?",

Currently, with a default incrementalrelayfee > 0, this PR isn't not going to mitigate the pinning issue network-wise as the absolute fee is committed as part of the txid and thus is strictly the _same_ between a divergent-wtxids/equivalent-txid transaction pair.\r\n\r\nIt needs more thoughts that the current PR which is more providing locally fee estimation between different witnesses to a user.",
