jtimon,2016-01-03T19:56:58Z,I changed my mind about this. I prefer something like https://github.com/jtimon/bitcoin/commit/8ec82416cdb48f6f01d49688406918be864d80b2 again.\nNACK\nIn any case rebase or close?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6774#issuecomment-168535109,168535109,

jtimon,2016-01-03T22:53:09Z,It's simpler and achieves the task of encapsulating consensus code more simply (although of course this is relative). I don't think a UseRule() function is interesting getting the consensus validation flags that include those rules (and I would unify other future consensus flags [like the one for bip113] with the script ones too).\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6774#issuecomment-168549479,168549479,
