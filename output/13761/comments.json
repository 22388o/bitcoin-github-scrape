When people see that the `datadir` has been generated they are confused about why there is no config file in there. At the very least we should prevent the daemon output from saying that it is using a conf file that doesn't exist.\r\n\r\nOn a higher level, I'm hoping to start contributing more to Bitcoin Core and I'd like to start with some changes that improve usability for new users.
