    "body": "I'm not sure this change is worth it and doesn't introduce more strange behaviors. If goal is to retroactively fix detection of change addresses in v0.19 wallets, this seems like it would simpler and be more convenient to use as a standalone wallet tool function.\r\n\r\nAs I understand things, #13756 in v0.19 introduced a bug where change addresses might be marked in a way where they are treated as non-change. #18192 in v0.20 fixed this by correctly interpreting all change addresses as change.\r\n\r\nThe benefit of this PR is it could be useful to someone who wants to keep running 0.19 software and have it keep incorrectly interpreting change addresses as non-change, but then periodically load up the wallet in a 0.20 node to tweak the database, so when they reload the wallet back in 0.19, the 0.19 software will now correctly see all change addresses as change (until it adds more change addresses that get misinterpreted and it is necessary to fix up the database with 0.20 again).\r\n\r\nThis seems like a pretty unusual use case and also one that would be less awkwardly handled with a standalone `bitcoin-wallet` tool function that just deletes the \"used\" destdata entries instead of storing them in a different way where the 0.19 code can't find them and 0.20 code now has to look for them",

I said \"DESTDATA rows\" and this is pretending I said \"destdata map entries\". I can see how the PR works, but I don't understand why it is complicating the destdata storage so much and munging v0.19 databases in the process instead of just adding a new field.

    "body": "re: http://www.erisian.com.au/bitcoin-core-dev/log-2020-04-10.html#l-542\r\n\r\n> there isn't really much context.. ryanofsky got confused by the PRs :/\r\n\r\nAppreciate the empathy, but I wasn't confused about what this PR and #18572 do. I was confused by what these PRs are _trying_ to do. But I get it now. Here is the story:\r\n\r\n#13756 started recording used destination information as rows with `(\"destdata\" << EncodeDestination(dest) << \"used\")` keys in the database. This was a mistake*. A simpler choice would have been to store these as `(\"destused\" << EncodeDestination(dest))` rows instead. A practical problem with the `(\"destdata\" << EncodeDestination(dest) << \"used\")` representation is that each time a change destination is marked used, pre-0.20 pre-#18192 wallets start treating it as non-change. #18192 fixes this for post-0.20 wallets so this is no longer a problem going foward.\r\n\r\nBut a question after #18192 is whether we want to keep using the same data representation or switch to a different one. The choices are:\r\n\r\n1. Keep storing used destination information in `(\"destdata\" << EncodeDestination(dest) << \"used\")` rows.\r\n2. Keep storing used destination information for non-change destinations in `(\"destdata\" << EncodeDestination(dest) << \"used\")` rows, but switch to `(\"changedata\" << EncodeDestination(dest) << \"used\")` rows for change destinations. Implemented in this PR.\r\n3. Start storing used destination information in another place like `(\"destused\" << EncodeDestination(dest))` rows. Unimplemented but simple to implement.\r\n\r\nI think the best choice is probably (1). It keeps things simple, requires no code changes, and causes no practical issues for 0.20 or future wallets other than using a slightly unusual key format. With choice (1), 0.19 and earlier software will continue to display \"used\" change addresses as non-change. But this issue has been around since #13756, doesn't seem very serious, and is easily fixed by using newer software. We could also backport simple fixes to old branches if desired.\r\n\r\nI think (2), which is implemented by this PR, is a bad choice because of the complexity and the strange behaviors described in my previous comments here. I think it's also awkward as data format because you wouldn't expect data about destination use to be stored differently depending on whether the destination is internal or external. The practical advantage of choice (2) over choice (1) is that if you loaded a post-#18550 wallet in 0.19 or earlier software, you would see used change addresses as change instead instead of non-change. But the avoid-reuse feature in 0.19 would still see new used changed addresses as non-change, and now see previous used changed addresses as non-used.\r\n\r\n(3) would be a simpler alternative to (2) if you want to fix old wallet software seeing used change addresses as non-change. But it has the same drawback as (2) where 0.19 wallets will see used change addresses as non-used and an additional drawback in that 0.19 software will also see used non-change addresses as non-used.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\\* This mistake would have been caught during #13756 review it weren't for layer violation in `CAddressBookData` exposing berkeley db keys to wallet code. #18608 fixes this to prevent mistakes like this going forward",
