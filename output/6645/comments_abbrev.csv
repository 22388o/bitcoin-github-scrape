gmaxwell,2015-09-07T23:36:57Z,"Technically it is the blockchain that is rescanned.  But these options have a boolean parameter ""rescan"" which defaults, so what its saying is that this option is disabled.\n\nI think if I were to clarify this further I would say that the rescan option was disabled.
