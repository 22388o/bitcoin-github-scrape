It chanages paths in makefile.linux-mingw or otherwise changes build scripts in a way that made them incompatible with the automated testing scripts\n2. It adds/modifies tests which test network rules (thanks for doing that), which conflicts with a patch applied at test time\n3. It does not build on either Linux i386 or Win32 (via MinGW cross compile)\n4. The test suite fails on either Linux i386 or Win32\n5. The block test-cases failed (lookup the first bNN identifier which failed in https://github.com/TheBlueMatt/test-scripts/blob/master/FullBlockTestGenerator.java)\n\nIf you believe this to be in error, please ping BlueMatt on freenode or TheBlueMatt here.\n",

    "body": "@petertodd : third commit just bumps version numbers to '0.8.1', I removed it from this pull only because it doesn't merge cleanly with git HEAD.\n\n@luke-jr : deep re-orgs are definitely a theoretical problem, but we have to weigh two months of chronic unconfirmed transactions if we set the block size too small versus coddling people/services who won't upgrade or set their DB_CONFIG.  Based on IRC conversation, I think the right thing to do is recommend setting DB_CONFIG for 120,000 locks instead of 50,000, although even that will cause problems for people running on low-memory VPS'es. But they should upgrade to 0.8 anyway to get much better performance...\n",
