laanwj,2016-04-03T12:56:12Z,The RPC tests don't use bitcoin-cli. At all.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7797#issuecomment-204969225,204969225,
sipa,2016-04-03T12:57:51Z,"The RPC tests do the conversion to JSON on the python side, I think; they\ndon't use bitcoin-cli (which is where the bug is).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7797#issuecomment-204969875,204969875,
laanwj,2016-04-03T13:05:10Z,"I also think that is right: the RPC tests test the RPC server, so should be using it directly.\n\nOfc it may be good to have a few separate tests for bitcoin-cli.\n\nOr a unit test for function `RPCConvertValues` that simply tests argument parsing (for various calls) in isolated fashion. That would be the most efficient way to cover this comprehensively.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7797#issuecomment-204970575,204970575,
