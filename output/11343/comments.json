    "body": "> So, the argument is that it is better that my wallet be on an unencrypted filesystem than a chance something might get corrupt?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nThe wallet database creates extra temporary files in the location of where Bitcoin Core thinks your wallet is (i.e. the symlink location). If your wallet is unencrypted (i.e. not using Bitcoin Core's wallet encryption), then those temporary files will be written to your unencrypted disk anyways and they may contain your unencrypted private keys. So keeping your wallet file on an encrypted disk is not helping as your private keys are unencrypted to the database software and may be written to an unencrypted disk while the wallet is in use.\r\n\r\n> I'm not sure I'm seeing how being on the same filesystem would prevent corruption. In my particular case, though, they are on the same filesystem, but the wallet goes through encfs to an underlying encrypted file on the filesystem.\r\n\r\nUsing symbolic linking may imply that you are attempting to use the same wallet file with different instances of Bitcoin Core (using an encrypted filesystem and symlinking is only one use case) which have different datadirs. If you were to shut down Bitcoin Core and the wallet database is not closed cleanly, there will be left over wallet database files in the datadir (i.e. not with the actual wallet file). If you then try to open it with another instance of Bitcoin Core with a different datadir, since the wallet.dat file was closed uncleanly and because the other datadir does not have the necessary wallet database files, you can have your wallet file corrupted.",

    "body": "> wouldn't this be the same case where only the .dat file is symlinked to another folder/partition?\r\n(that's my usual use case, like @wtogami, on an encrypted partition)\r\n\r\nNo it is not. When only the wallet file is symlinked, the wallet database files are created in the Bitcoin Core datadir which contains the symlink. They are not created in the folder containing the actual file itself. When you point the datadir and symlink the chainstate and blocks folder, the wallet database files will be in the same folder as the wallet file itself.\r\n\r\nHere's some poor ascii art:\r\n\r\nWhat happens when you symlink wallet.dat\r\n```\r\nDatadir on unencrypted disk | Folder on encrypted disk \r\n--------------------------- | -----------------------\r\n wallet database temp files |\r\n symlink to wallet.dat file | -------> actual wallet.dat file \r\n              blocks folder |\r\n          chainstate folder |\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat happens when you symlink other datadir stuff\r\n```\r\nFolder on unencrypted disk | Datadir on encrypted disk \r\n-------------------------- | -----------------------\r\n                           | wallet database temp files \r\n                           | actual wallet.dat file\r\n      actual blocks folder | <----- symlink to blocks folder \r\n  actual chainstate folder | <----- symlink chainstate folder \r\n```",

How do you propose to address my other concern about potential for \"other bombs\" left in the code or the loss of trust caused by hidden, incompatible changes?\r\n\r\n@ryanofsky that's good news.\r\n\r\nAll, usually I try to leave a constructive idea with a gripe. Sorry for the first post where I forgot to do that, so here it is:\r\n\r\nThe correct approach to resolve symlink problems and protect users does require to detect them and handle appropriately. In this case I suspect that would be to de-reference to the real path and use that instead of the path containing the symlink. However because core writes a bunch of stuff with canned filenames to accompany the wallet file, those names also need to change because the symlink may be selecting one file from a directory containing multiple wallet files.",

Not explicitly, but implicitly, likely the same way core supports running on an SSD versus a mechanical hard disk or possibly even an AMD vs. Intel processor.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of relative safety arguments for SSD vs. mechanical, and there are unique failure cases for a symlink vs. real file in the directory.\r\n\r\nIn my case, a symlink is safer because it allows me to keep my wallet files together where they all have daily encrypted backup with a history going back several years. Changing a symlink to change wallets is a lot less error prone and risky than copying a wallet file into the active location and copying it back out some time later.\r\n\r\nSo now my choice is to run my own patched version of core, or take increased risk with my wallet files.",
