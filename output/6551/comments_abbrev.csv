TheBlueMatt,2015-08-13T08:19:41Z,"Not to bikeshed this, but we should figure out if we want to use the throw() syntax in function declarations. We have it in bool CLevelDBWrapper::WriteBatch(CLevelDBBatch& batch, bool fSync) throw(leveldb_error), but not in CLevelDBWrapper::CLevelDBWrapper(const boost::filesystem::path& path, size_t nCacheSize, bool fMemory, bool fWipe), which is strange.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6551#issuecomment-130572235,130572235,

ajweiss,2015-08-13T17:24:31Z,"Naw, not bikeshedding.  I'll pull them out and in the process will end up auditing a bunch of failure cases for leveldb.  In light of recent reports of leveldb corruption, this is a good thing.  Thanks for the feedback!\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6551#issuecomment-130769600,130769600,
