TheBlueMatt,2017-02-08T18:20:31Z,Rebased. Note that this now forms the first of a rather long patchset to move wallet callbacks into a background thread without introducing races in APIs or wallet consistency issues.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9605#issuecomment-278415933,278415933,

sipa,2017-01-20T22:56:02Z,Adapt comment here as well?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9605#discussion_r97172475,97172475,src/scheduler.h
TheBlueMatt,2017-01-20T23:14:32Z,"No, it still must run inside a boost::thread because it relies on boost::interruption_point. I believe @theuni is planning on cleaning that up.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9605#discussion_r97174496,97174496,src/scheduler.h
TheBlueMatt,2017-01-20T23:31:29Z,"well technically boost::thread takes a boost::function, so I assume if you uses std::bind it would create a boost::function around the std::function......I'll let cory do that when we kill boost::threads.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9605#discussion_r97176406,97176406,src/scheduler.h
theuni,2017-01-21T07:08:49Z,"Yes, I have a local branch with CScheduler converted. I'm doing them in chunks, because the last huge PR proved to be too big to review/rebase. I'll submit that one next (#9566 is the current one).",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9605#discussion_r97192826,97192826,src/scheduler.h
laanwj,2017-01-23T12:27:02Z,"If you're renaming this function please, finally, change it to something else than FlushWalletDB. What is being done here is not merely a flush (those are done all the time as CWalletDB instances go out of scope) but more like ""database consolidation"", merging the log files into wallet.dat so that the wallet is self-contained. This has confused many people over time.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9605#discussion_r97307597,97307597,src/wallet/walletdb.cpp
TheBlueMatt,2017-01-23T14:28:47Z,"Done, called it ""compact""",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9605#discussion_r97327821,97327821,src/wallet/walletdb.cpp
