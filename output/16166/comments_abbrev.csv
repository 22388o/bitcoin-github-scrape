laanwj,2019-06-08 14:42:18,"We don't have a fixed rule that every `cpp` should be accompanied by a `.h` with the same name. Maybe this is useful for your tool, but I don't personally think it warrants changing 20 files.\n(not a hard NACK but pleaasee let's focus on user issues instead of these kind of things that keep breaking other PRs and make rebasing hard)",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16166#issuecomment-500129335,500129335,

Empact,2019-06-10 01:59:18,"Concept ACK in addition to making the files more focused, it reduces the symbols unnecessarily included in several cases. In the ideal case we'd have a minimal set of definitions per concept/file, included only where needed, this is a modest step in that direction.\n\n> I don't personally think it warrants changing 20 files.\n\nMost of the files are include-only changes, which have modest impl",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16166#issuecomment-500267457,500267457,
MarcoFalke,2019-06-10 06:11:42,"Thank you for your contribution. While this stylistic change makes sense on its own, it comes at a cost and risk for the project as a whole. The weak motivation for the change does not justify the burden that it places on the project. A burden could be any of the following:\n\n* Time spent on review\n* Accidental introduction of bugs\n* (Silent) merge conflicts, either in the branch or a backp",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16166#issuecomment-500303608,500303608,
