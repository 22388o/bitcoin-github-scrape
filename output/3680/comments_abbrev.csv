int03h,2014-02-16T16:05:58Z,With Armory it reduces DB scan / load times significantly. From an hour or 2 to around 15-20 minutes or so on Windoze. (to be fair .. I use 2000MB instead of 25MB or even 100MB) .. it also seems to speed up initial load times a lot. \n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3680#issuecomment-35200342,35200342,
