gmaxwell,2014-11-08T18:58:41Z,Nak. I'd prefer not to do this. \n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5242#issuecomment-62270871,62270871,
sandakersmann,2014-11-08T19:08:33Z,Ok. Any specific reason why you prefer not to do it?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5242#issuecomment-62271199,62271199,
kanzure,2014-11-08T19:12:57Z,"Independent of whether or not this pull request is accepted, I would suggest squashing these commits into a single commit only. Normally I am a strong supporter of individual, numerous and atomic commits, but when the commit message between each never differs, there's really no strong reason to use many individual commits to accomplish what could be done with just one.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5242#issuecomment-62271351,62271351,
gmaxwell,2014-11-08T19:21:55Z,"Yes, I also agree that it should be squashed... right now it's hard to review and would harm bisect.. Just didn't mention it because I don't think this should go in at all.\n\nThe source code isn't the right place to advocate a new word. This change doesn't improve clarity, but it touches a lot of files.  Pedantically, I don't know how much ""blockchain"" makes much sense as a free standing concept;",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5242#issuecomment-62273376,62273376,
jonasschnelli,2014-11-08T19:31:42Z,"NACK on source-code, source-docs level.\nIt complicates searches.\nDoes not really improve the bitcoin project.\n\nI would also say, the ""blockchain"" (bitcoin) is a ""block chain"". Block chain is more a type of trusted storage.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5242#issuecomment-62273710,62273710,
sandakersmann,2014-11-08T19:32:09Z,Blockchain is not really a new word. It is used along with block chain and block-chain all over the repo. This is a move to establish a standard.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5242#issuecomment-62273721,62273721,
gmaxwell,2014-11-08T19:40:32Z,The code is pretty consistent currently; it's hyphenated in four places. The Bitcoin core source isn't the place to establish word standards (esp not by making dozens of commits.)\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5242#issuecomment-62274002,62274002,
sandakersmann,2014-11-08T19:53:58Z,Ok. I see your point about squashing these commits into one. Just need to do some research on how to do that.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5242#issuecomment-62275519,62275519,

jgarzik,2014-11-08T23:31:45Z,"For future reference, please do not create a new pull request for the same change.
