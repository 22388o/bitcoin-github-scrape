That doesn't have the latency advantages, though.\n",

I think the fact that you feel the need to defend it this way is a sign that it may be too immature to include.  Better protocols can come in the future, but old ones need to be supported a long time.\n\nWRT latency, you're talking about 1x RTT for an event that happens once per ten minutes in the steady state. Or an overhead or a 0.01% performance difference for 100ms RTT.  Am I missing something there?\n",

    "body": "It reduces memory requirements during chain sync. Anyway, I disagree that requiring a getdata is better. The node knows exactly what comes next after sending the filtered blocks. A getdata is superfluous.\n\nWRT \"railroading\". The code we have works fine. This tweak is not essential but simplifies the code on the client side when various changes that I just posted about to bitcoin-security are implemented. There's no reason not to do it. More generally - perfect is the enemy of the good. Bitcoin does not have infinite time. It isn't something to polish in an ivory tower, after all, Bitcoin already came to the world in a far from perfect state. If SPV clients have acceptable performance 5 years from now it will be irrelevant, people will have either given up on Bitcoin or all be using ad-hoc protocols that talk to different kinds of servers, Electrum style. Forward progress is essential and these changes have taken too long already.\n",

    "body": "As I didn't want to restart the discussion about this, I probably shouldn't have brought it up again. I believe the Bloom filtering was well thought-out, and the reason for sending transactions immediately was also clear. Reducing latency for mobile clients was a design goal, and that outweighs neatness. I'm fine with this change (to be honest, I assumed this was how it was implemented in the first place). I just wanted to mention that the fact that we need to change something like this because of an implementation issue, makes me feel uneasy. But perhaps there are others who feel the same way...\n",
