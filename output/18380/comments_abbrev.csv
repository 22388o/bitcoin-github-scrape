laanwj,2020-03-19 08:01:52,"As I was the one to introduce this comment in the first place in #16962 I'm divided about this, but okay, concept ACK, I definitely don't have the energy anymore to argue about anything. In any case an alternative would be to make the merge script strip out comments.\n(which might be preferable long-term in any case to avoid people putting ""hidden"" data in there)",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18380#issuecomment-601040481,601040481,

That would force people to take care of it themselves.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18380#issuecomment-601287320,601287320,
laanwj,2020-03-21 11:15:40,That sounds like an interesting approach (independent from this PR). Does Travis have access to the PR message? I guess a linter could query it through the github API with the same code as `github-merge.py`.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18380#issuecomment-602029056,602029056,
promag,2020-03-23 00:51:07,Github could allow us to see the raw comment in the UI. Maybe @DrahtBot could post it and warn the user to clean it? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ ,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18380#issuecomment-602309577,602309577,
