MarcoFalke,2017-12-21T15:59:13Z,"@promag Adding at the end of run-time sections doesn't help with merge conflict. Sorting by name would. Though, since we plan to rename the tests, I don't want to go in this direction.\n@thijstriemstra Reworked wording a bit.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11965#issuecomment-353387332,353387332,
