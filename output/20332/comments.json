OSS-Fuzz is open source in the form of [ClusterFuzz](https://github.com/google/clusterfuzz). I hope that some day we'll have a dedicated Bitcoin Core private ClusterFuzz installation where the security team would have immediate access to crash cases.\r\n\r\nCI-Fuzz: _\"OSS-Fuzz offers CIFuzz, a GitHub action/CI job that runs your fuzz targets on pull requests. This works similarly to running unit tests in CI. CIFuzz helps you find and fix bugs before they make it into your codebase.
