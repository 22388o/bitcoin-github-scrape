practicalswift,2020-11-07 19:42:28,"Concept ACK\n\nFWIW this is functionally equivalent to the local fuzzing harness modification that allowed me to find [the recent wtxid crash bug](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20317#issuecomment-723046620). A vulnerability which luckily didn't make it to any release :)",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20332#issuecomment-723486268,723486268,
MarcoFalke,2020-11-10 09:21:42,"@practicalswift Mind reviewing this? Without this, it is not possible to get meaningful coverage in net_processing. Also, I have more patches on top that increase coverage, which are blocked on this one.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20332#issuecomment-724575526,724575526,

Thanks for fixing this!\n\nReally nice to see the fuzzers catch real issues long befo",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20332#issuecomment-724893664,724893664,
