vasild,2021-10-05 14:30:12,"Why is it incompatible? In the output above there is 1 error due to `Wc++11-narrowing` and 1 warning due to `Wbraced-scalar-init`. When the latter is disabled the warning is not shown. I don't see the relation (incompatibility) between the two options.\n\nOTOH, `F({a})` looks wrong, I would like the compiler to point it to me so that I can fix it to `F(a)`, no?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23191#issuecomment-934466321,934466321,
