laanwj,2016-09-14T08:40:37Z,Is this something that belongs on CConnman? Conceptually it seems a bit odd to have randomization on the network manager.\nE.g. Could there be reasons to have deterministic randomizers that don't have (directly) to do with networking? Not sure. Maybe for randomizing data structures such as caches?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8688#discussion_r78707468,78707468,src/net.h
sipa,2016-09-19T11:41:34Z,"Well it's only used for randomization that is specific to networking. The chainstate cache for example also has a randomized, and that one is independent.\n\nI expect longer term that there will be something like network event/message handlers, and the ProcessMessage code in main now will move to such a handler that registers itself with a connman. The randomizer code could then go into the specif",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8688#discussion_r79372904,79372904,src/net.h
