Just making the test atomic prevents the that particular bit of UB but it doesn't mean that there isn't wasted work, or even the potential of a deadlock.\r\n\r\nCan someone please summarize how the same block can get checked in parallel and why it makes sense for that to happen? 14058 simply states the test fail with thread sanitizing enabled, but don't explain the sequence of events that lead to the race. I want to make sure that we're not bandaging over a structural flaw that should be fixed with a lock someplace or some other change.  ",

With only about 100 blocks in total, it is unlikely that every thread picks blocks that have not yet been picked by another thread.\r\nSo I think there are at least two alternative solutions:\r\n\r\n* Assume that we only ever call `ProcessNewBlock` for each block once, so we'd rewrite the unit test to not pick a random block, but pop (remove and return) a random block from the list. But this assumption seems unlikely, since a block could arrive on the p2p and rpc interface at the same time, which then both call `ProcessNewBlock`.\r\n* Assume that `ProcessNewBlock` avoids checking the same block twice, which could be fixed by guarding the read-write of fChecked on a larger scope, instead of just fixing the symptom that the member variable is racy.\r\n* something else?",
