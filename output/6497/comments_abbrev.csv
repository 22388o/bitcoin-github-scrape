morcos,2015-07-31T15:14:19Z,"It might be ugly, but it was working correctly before right?  This will cause extra new lines I think, because NewTx above prints a new line.  I guess we could just remove it from there.  This may be a case of too much debugging, I'm not sure if we want all these anyway....\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6497#discussion_r35982888,35982888,src/policy/fees.cpp

morcos,2015-08-03T14:45:20Z,"I apologize for the ugly code again, but in the `if` and `else if`, `feeStats` and `priStats` both call `NewTx` respectively.  `NewTx` adds a new line.   I'd suggest leaving your change, but removing the new line in the `LogPrint` call in `NewTx`.  Or, removing all the `LogPrint` lines altogether, what are your thoughts about the level of debugging?  I found this useful in writing this code and fo",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6497#discussion_r36091758,36091758,src/policy/fees.cpp
laanwj,2015-08-03T15:26:15Z,"OK, will do that.\nThis is optional debugging, so I think having it in the first place is fine. It can be useful if someone wants to troubleshoot the fee estimation, which I'm sure has to happen at some point.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6497#discussion_r36096422,36096422,src/policy/fees.cpp
