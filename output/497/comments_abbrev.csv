jgarzik,2011-09-06T18:34:58Z,"By ""update commit"" we mean to rebase your commit so that there is (a) only one commit, and (b) that commit updates *.po file.\n\nWe would prefer to -not- merge Commit A and Commit B, where Commit B simply fixes Commit A.  We would rather just have an updated Commit A.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/497#issuecomment-2020711,2020711,
