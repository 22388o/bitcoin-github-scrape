laanwj,2012-05-13T08:18:11Z,"Hmm.. on one hand, I agree that it doesn't strictly need to be a function, on the other hand, I don't really like exported free-for-all global state as you cannot enforce read-only. It's almost a necessity to have getters/setters in C++ for this reason.\n\nI don't buy ""CPU efficient"" here. DataDir is used sparsely with I/O, not with intensive computation. The decision should completely be based on",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1281#issuecomment-5674763,5674763,

Diapolo,2012-05-13T09:46:13Z,Wouldn't it be nicer to simply make the GetDataDir() function use a static constant but non global variable? I don't really like the solution this pull offers.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1281#issuecomment-5675164,5675164,
jgarzik,2012-05-13T18:46:28Z,@sipa: You're right.  That's a bug...  I meant to use the net-specific path.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1281#issuecomment-5678430,5678430,

sipa,2012-05-13T09:41:10Z,I think you want to put the net-specific path in pathDataDir - that's the one used almost everywhere but in GetConfigFile.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1281#discussion_r813262,813262,src/util.cpp
