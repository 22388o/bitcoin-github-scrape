ghost,2017-08-09T11:26:10Z,Why not relax the rule to instead allow for a maximum of e.g. 3 connections to nodes with the service bits 5 and 7? That way the network may stay fully connected both before and after a 2x HF in three months.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11001#issuecomment-321227975,321227975,
MarcoFalke,2017-08-09T11:37:57Z,"This was meant as a minimal fix/diff to be included in the first release candidate of 0.15.0, which was already due last Sunday. Beside the additional review required for more complex changes to p2p logic, it is unlikely that a more involved fix makes it into 0.15.0. Code cleanup for 0.16.0 is welcome, though.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11001#issuecomment-321230484,321230484,
TheBlueMatt,2017-08-09T20:37:29Z,"The 2x/Bitcoin networks will stay trivially connected through the next few months. There is no chance that everyone running 0.13/0.14 nodes will upgrade to 15 that quickly - we've never seen upgrades anywhere near that fast in the past, even when there was more incentive to do so.\n\nOn August 9, 2017 4:26:17 AM PDT, bmagn <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n>Why not relax the rule to instead allow",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11001#issuecomment-321374390,321374390,
jnewbery,2017-08-09T20:51:39Z,Please can we lock this PR? This PR added a new functional test case and is not the place to discuss the merits/demerits of the node disconnection behaviour in 10982. Thanks!,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11001#issuecomment-321377806,321377806,
