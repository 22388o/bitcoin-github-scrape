TheBlueMatt,2017-10-31T20:41:38Z,Isn't this just pulling a single commit out of #10866? #10866 seems more than sufficiently small of a PR for its own review.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11587#issuecomment-340900268,340900268,
practicalswift,2017-10-31T21:18:29Z,"@TheBlueMatt Yes, this one-line-fix is also included in #10866. Since the review of #10866 is taking some time my thinking was that this trivial fix could perhaps get in faster than #10866 which has some additional stuff (Travis CI changes + change of `sync.h` primitives to `std` from `boost`).\n\nHaving #10866 reviewed and merged would be even better and would render this PR obsolete :-)",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11587#issuecomment-340909765,340909765,
fanquake,2017-11-01T10:59:09Z,"Agree with @TheBlueMatt. Splitting up PRs to get them ""merged quicker"" really just creates noise, and fragments discussion. This could be merged, but no-one would really see the benefits until #10866 is merged anyways, so it might as well all happen at once.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11587#issuecomment-341075766,341075766,
