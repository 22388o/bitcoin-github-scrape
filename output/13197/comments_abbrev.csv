laanwj,2018-05-09T08:48:48Z,"> I am adding extra work for @jnewbery in #12755 here -- maybe I should just rebase on top of that, but not sure what the appropriate approach is here.\n\nI (personally) prefer if PRs are more or less independent.\nAs having a web of dependencies between them makes it even harder to keep track of them.\nOn the other hand, #10267 is now in, and #12755 should probably be next.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13197#issuecomment-387668958,387668958,

laanwj,2018-05-10T07:26:46Z,"> @promag Is it better locking the whole time?\n\nI don't know what the potential races here are, but If everything else is the same, keeping the lock closely around the section where it is needed is preferable. Also: calls such as `GetArgs` take their own lock, so already holding it is sloppy.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13197#issuecomment-387975222,387975222,

kallewoof,2018-05-11T10:56:40Z,I can try moving the lock to the top of the method and remove it elsewhere. I am concerned it may cause deadlocks though.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13197#issuecomment-388331596,388331596,
