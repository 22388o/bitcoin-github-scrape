jgarzik,2012-06-27T15:48:04Z,"@gmaxwell all the kernel interfaces that SNMP uses tend to return groups of statistics that the kernel finds easy to generate together (tx pkts, rx pkts, rx bytes, tx bytes, collisions, ...)  I see the same pattern elsewhere.  So perhaps 'getstat $STAT' can return complex objects, if it is natural to do so internally.\n\nRegardless... closing.  will work on 'getpeerinfo' and then see what's left.\",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1510#issuecomment-6607104,6607104,
