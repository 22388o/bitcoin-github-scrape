I see why the original implementation was really confusing (no coins ever mined to `ADDRESS_BCRT1_P2WSH_OP_TRUE` although the code makes you expect that to happen). But I don't really get why the assertion changes from `250` to `248` assuming it wasn't already failing. And I also don't understand why it fits into this PR. Any explanation here could help me get to an ACK quicker\r\n- Nice speedup results in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21762/commits/fa40eb5b6bfd151912c58d61771f6a6528f44e67. Am I correct that `wallet.generate(200)` is what is slowing these `MiniWallet` tests down? And that the approach you use here would be the gold standard for other `MiniWallet` tests going forward?",

It seems this would have to be used very carefully, with knowledge of `MiniWallet`'s internals to avoid bugs. For example, if `scan_blocks` is called multiple times with any overlapping blocks, then we'll start to get duplicate utxos in `self._utxos` (maybe this should be a set instead of a list)? \r\n\r\nIn general I also don't really like how `self._utxos` is sorted (in `send_self_transfer` by value), while here it isn't sorted but will have an implicit ordering based on when/how `scan_blocks` is called, and then based on order of blocks/vouts inside `scan_blocks`. There's just a lot of different ways it's ordered and we are always relying on that ordering\r\n\r\nI'm gonna think this through, don't think this should hold up this PR. But at least I can start the discussion and see what you think / if this can be improved.",
