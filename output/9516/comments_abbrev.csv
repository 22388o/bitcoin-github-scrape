gmaxwell,2017-01-13T08:47:38Z,"Why isn't this using LastCommonAncestor/FindFork or equivalent? I believe doing that would give precisely the correct behavior.\n\n(Aside: Good find.

luke-jr,2017-01-20T21:54:47Z,"Looks like improvement, but I'm not sure it fixes all the issues: if a transaction was confirmed on the ""since"" block, and no longer is, we should include it in the results even if it did not change between the fork-point and tip.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9516#issuecomment-274190081,274190081,
kallewoof,2017-01-23T01:03:33Z,"@luke-jr Yeah, a double spend of the same UTXO will result in no transaction showing up, which is definitely not ideal..",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9516#issuecomment-274375378,274375378,
