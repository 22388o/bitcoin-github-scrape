In this case blocks are usually referenced by height or hash.\n\nThere is also overloading in the protocol: `4   lock_time   uint32_t    A time (Unix epoch time) or block number. See the locktime parsing rules`.\n\n> It seems messy, and we don't do that anywhere else on the API.\n\nFrom `help importaddress`: `1. \"script\"           (string, required) The hex-encoded script (or address) either`.\n\n> E.g. a long hash with no hexadecimal characters could be interpreted as a long number.\n\nUnlikely? Still it's simple to distinguish that block hash from a number.\n\n> Though even then I'm not convinced it's a worthwhile addition.\n\nFrom the API point of view, I think it's fair to fetch a block from it's height. From a technical point of view, making 2 calls causing locks on cs_main etc on a heavy loaded daemon is resource wasting.\n\nSo, +1 for `getblock hash|height (verbose)`.\n",

    "body": "It's better. But still this is special casing to work around one specific round-trip. This opens the flood-gates to many more.\n\nTo solve this more generally I plan on working on a cute little extension RFC to the [JSONRPC 2.0 spec](http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification). See discussion in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7783#issuecomment-239442267 .\n\nThis will add a simple form of (in-batch) promise pipelining to JSON-RPC batching, which will allow doing this kind of composition in a more flexible way. Eg `ext_store` and `ext_load` below:\n\n``` javascript\n[\n{\n    \"version\": \"x.x\",\n    \"method\": \"getblockhash\",\n    \"id\": 0,\n    \"params\": [\"123456\"],\n    \"ext_store\": True   // Store the result of this request for later use\n},\n{\n    \"version\": \"x.x\",\n    \"method\": \"getblock\",\n    \"id\": 1,\n    \"params\": [\n        null // Placeholder for argument 0, will be replaced by ext_load below\n    ],\n    \"ext_load\": [\n        {\n            \"src\": [0, \"result\"],  // Load the output of request id 0, [\"result\"]\n            \"dst\": [0]             // into into params[0]\n        }\n    ],\n}\n]\n```\n\nThe effect of which will be:\n\n``` javascript\ntmp0 = getblockhash(123456);\ntmp1 = getblock(tmp0);\n```\n\nIn contrast to simple nesting of calls, which would be the alternative extension, this also allows for more complex composition, and re-use of values.\n\nReturning:\n\n``` javascript\n[\n{\n    \"id\": 0,\n    \"error\": null,\n    \"result\": \"0000000000002917ed80650c6174aac8dfc46f5fe36480aaef682ff6cd83c3ca\"\n},\n{\n    \"id\": 1,\n    \"error\": null,\n    \"result\": {\n        \"hash\": ...,\n        \"confirmations\": ...,\n        ...\n    }\n}\n]\n```\n",

    "body": "> but in our case it will still have the wallet locks and performance issues.\n\nThat's an implementation detail and will likely go away in the future, and we should not design the RPC protocol around that. In any case what use-case to you have that requires shaving a few milliseconds from a getblock call? Have you benchmarked? I'm fairly sure most of the bottleneck is reading and parsing the block and formatting JSON [hopefully done without holding the cs_main lock] - if the latter, have you looked at the REST interface?\n\nEdit: If you need _a lot_ of getblock calls you can pipeline without any RPC extensions: in the first batch, run getblockhash on block number 0..X - this is what our linearize.py script does too. In the second batch you can then request all the actual block data using `getblock`.\n\n> I think it's a security risk to support getblock by height directly. People shouldn't use height to refer to specific blocks, since reorgs can change the block at a given height.\n\nInteresting point. It's safe for old blocks, but for working at the tip, using it probably means you're not handling reorgs properly.\n",
