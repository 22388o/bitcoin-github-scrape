robot-visions,2020-04-24 17:59:40,"Just curious, how did you get this value `59.999928` (did you print out the amount to check, or is there a known fee that's listed somewhere)?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18724#discussion_r414761603,414761603,test/functional/interface_bitcoin_cli.py

jonatack,2020-04-24 19:32:24,"I arbitrarily used the default `rpc_timeout`. But you're right to mention it; the magic value is kind of sucky and non-informative.
