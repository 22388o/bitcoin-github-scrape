Only touches one line of code so hopefully shouldn't interfere with any other PRs in the works. Don't think it has any denial-of-service impact; buggy nodes all seem like they'll announce bip31 compliant version numbers anyway, and people doing deliberate attacks can just do ping/pong to keep the connection open anyway.",
