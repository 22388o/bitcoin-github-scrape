As I read it #9963 was more about developer ergonomics? :-)\r\n\r\nI think we intentionally didn't mention the issue there.\r\nIt's very simply: have an under-tested error path in the network code with an invalid LogPrintf() spec. Anything that triggers this will crash the process. A little loggable offense turns into a full DoS vector.\r\n\r\n> Could a middle ground be to make strprintf(\u2026) noexcept and keep LogPrintf(...) as is?\r\n\r\nI think that would be a better idea.
