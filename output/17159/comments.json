Which leads me to following idea of text:\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nBackporting is done whenever the fix needs to be present in a release branch (e.g. a security issue) or on request. If the backport is trivial and can be cherry-picked automatically, just request a \"Needs backport\" tag for the original issue or PR. If backport needs any conflict resolution, create the PR manually and wait for comments.\r\n\r\nThe commit message of a backport should additionally contain following two lines in the end:\r\n\r\n```\r\nGithub-Pull: #<original issue/PR number>\r\nRebased-From: <sha checksum of the code already merged into master branch>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat do you think @laanwj ?
