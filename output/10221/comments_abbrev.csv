TheBlueMatt,2017-04-18T16:41:54Z,"@sdaftuar went and tested and realized at least I and a few others had a misunderstanding in #10178 - the intended goal of all this logic is to hide orphaned coinbases, but it, as far as I can tell, was always broken in >1 block reorgs (even prior to #10178), and I'm still dubious about having this logic in order to have that behavior - how is a coinbase transaction paying you getting orphaned any",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10221#issuecomment-294905167,294905167,
sipa,2017-04-18T17:28:07Z,"I assume the original reason (whether it worked or not) was because a reorg will always kill a coinbase payout, while normal transactions (in non-adverserial situations) will just migrate to the new chain.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10221#issuecomment-294918952,294918952,
TheBlueMatt,2017-04-18T17:53:10Z,"@sipa yes, I assume it predated conflicted tagging transactions. Now that we have conflict tracking, I'd still say we should remove it.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10221#issuecomment-294927786,294927786,
sipa,2017-04-18T18:06:17Z,"Concept ACK\n\n@TheBlueMatt Sure, I was just speculating why this logic existed specifically for coinbases and not other transactions.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10221#issuecomment-294931884,294931884,
