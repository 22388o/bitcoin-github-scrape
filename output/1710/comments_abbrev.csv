gmaxwell,2012-08-23T14:26:24Z,"I don't disagree with doing this, but we should keep in mind that a slightly unfortunate result of this is that an attacker could network isolate old pre-bip16 nodes by constantly flooding invalid transactions. If there are any pre-bip16 miners remaining, the attacker will be able to force the creation of a forked network.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1710#issuecomment-7971314,7971314,
