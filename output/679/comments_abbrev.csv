runeksvendsen,2011-12-09T01:46:53Z,"Thanks for writing this patch laanwj!\n\nI did some testing, and it works fine for me unless I use the option ""Minimize to the tray instead of the taskbar"". If this option is on, then I am not able to get the GUI back to an unminimized state after I start it. This is only the case when the program is started initially. If this setting is ON, and the program is started with the -min option, I can't",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/679#issuecomment-3074320,3074320,
runeksvendsen,2011-12-09T02:23:58Z,"It would be nice if the splash screen wasn't shown when the -min option is specified. I tried writing a patch, but got stuck when I found out that I can't use GetBoolArg to decide whether or not to show the splash screen, since at the point in the code where the splash screen is shown AppInit2 hasn't been run yet, and it's in AppInit2 that the variable (mapArgs) needed for GetBoolArg to function i",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/679#issuecomment-3074677,3074677,
laanwj,2011-12-09T09:11:43Z,"1) yes, currently it does not take into account ""minimize to the tray"" because this is not a Qt feature, we'd need to override `BitcoinGUI::showMinimized` to take this into account\n\n2) I think a neat way would be to put basic argument parsing (ParseParameters) to beginning of main(), after Qt had its shot at the arguments with QApplication() ... Could just put a `#ifndef QT_GUI` around it in ini",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/679#issuecomment-3076819,3076819,
runeksvendsen,2011-12-09T18:40:00Z,"I see. I guess 1) will have to wait some time then. Maybe we should ignore the ""minimize to tray""-setting when the ""-min"" option is specified?\n\nI have implemented 2) in pull request #690\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/679#issuecomment-3083691,3083691,
