I understand the desire of developers not to be bothered with issues like this, but the reality is that this attack vector is not going away.\r\n\r\nInstead of giving in to bullying and troll lawsuits (https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoincore.org/pull/740), I think it's much better to designate few people from the community who are willing to go to court and can easily bear stress/financial burden to uphold the principles of freedom we all should stand for. Then, for resolving PRs like this - one of those people can merge and if CSW (or whoever) comes back and threatens to sue - you can just punt the request to them.",
