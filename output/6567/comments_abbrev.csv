domob1812,2015-08-18T07:22:45Z,"I agree in principle (that's why the message/error is keypool specific only in the RPC code and not `miner.cpp`).  However, the keypool _is_ explicitly a ""concept"" part of the RPC interface (with the specific error code), thus I think it should be handled there.\n\nOf course, if in the future more conditions can cause a missing script to be returned, one also needs to add a method to signal the er",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6567#issuecomment-132100244,132100244,

jonasschnelli,2015-08-18T07:14:56Z,"This could also be triggered if the connected signal listener does not provide a script for other reasons than a non-filled keypool.
