Altoidnerd,2014-04-16T14:17:10Z,"Ha! That's clever! If you want it done I'll do it, let me know.  Your call, you're the man.  The drawback could be that if you do this once, you set the precedent and have to do it in other places.  \n\nCongratulations on your new position BTW.  Things are running very well and we all appreciate it.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4063#issuecomment-40603709,40603709,
laanwj,2014-04-16T14:19:52Z,"Thank you!\n\nIn other places it may not be needed because the input is verified. For example the gitian builder does exactly this check already. As the file is downloaded over http, it could be easy to patch in something nasty while underway.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4063#issuecomment-40604031,40604031,
Altoidnerd,2014-04-16T14:38:48Z,"I like the checksum, because the user experience while doing the build is ""apt-get apt-get ok that's fine i'm safe apt-get"" then suddenly you're downloading from another party.  It is kind of odd - it confused me twice.  \n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4063#issuecomment-40606493,40606493,
Altoidnerd,2014-04-16T14:41:19Z,"I haven't tried the other method because I didn't realize it was there, which says something.  I should.  I think its worthwhile to make the builds easier as time goes on to encourage the practice. \n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4063#issuecomment-40606822,40606822,
laanwj,2014-04-16T15:11:50Z,"Yes, making the builds easier (or at least documenting better how to do it) would be good. Switching to autotools was a step in this direction.\n\nCommitted through 61d388d98ddd6d3fd521b6afbbb06209a6a50598\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4063#issuecomment-40610777,40610777,
