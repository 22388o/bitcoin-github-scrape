Diapolo,2015-02-26T10:03:38Z,I'm happy to have that feature for the options window... so NACK from me on that one.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5830#issuecomment-76151595,76151595,
paveljanik,2015-02-26T10:19:33Z,"I think this is good change for both. Remembering the position only makes sense for a window you/user use more often (like e.g. Debug window/Console, Network traffic etc.) and is likely to move it on the screen where he wants to have it.\n\nOptions dialog is a different beast IMO.\n\nIt would be nice to have a feature to open Debug window at the start automatically and even more nice would be to h",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5830#issuecomment-76153837,76153837,

laanwj,2015-02-26T10:23:18Z,@diapolo I just don't see the point. Personally I rather have (run of the mill) sub-windows just pop up relative to their main window instead of wherever I had them last time.\nThe main window itself and the RPC console are exceptions to this as people will want to keep them open at the same time and not overlapping. But for the options window I just don't see the point.\n\n@paveljanik Nice idea. ,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5830#issuecomment-76154370,76154370,
