morcos,2016-01-02T14:52:39Z,"I wrote this code, so apologies on the mistakes and ACK on the changes.\n\nBut in general I'm not sure its worth the review time for minor comment fixes like this, especially in relatively new code.  I anticipate that this code will be changed somewhat significantly over the next few releases.   There is much other code that needs commenting in the first place or editing for clarity of understandi",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7268#issuecomment-168396932,168396932,

paveljanik,2016-01-03T13:05:19Z,"@hoffmabc Please add dots at the end of ""We have to lump..."" paragraph. And also fix your typo in the commit description (gramattical). I like one space too.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7268#issuecomment-168496601,168496601,
laanwj,2016-01-16T09:54:48Z,"Closing this, it creates too much discussion for a simple whitespace change.\n\nAlso agree with @morcos .

MarcoFalke,2016-01-02T12:47:07Z,NACK on those. Doxygen doesn't care about such white space. IIrc we already had this discussion.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7268#discussion_r48684420,48684420,src/policy/fees.h
