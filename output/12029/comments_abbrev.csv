fanquake,2017-12-29T22:46:00Z,Tested 0f36dba. ```make docs``` and ```make clean-docs``` work as intended. @theuni Any thoughts here?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12029#issuecomment-354509202,354509202,

theuni,2018-01-10T03:31:41Z,"Concept ACK. Agreed with @laanwj's comments.\n\ndoxygen may not be found in the user's path, it may instead be passed like:\n ```./configure DOXYGEN=/my/path/to/doxygen```.\n\nHaving it configured as a tool in configure.ac ensures that that works properly. It also means that we can skip it if it's ever added to the main build, but doxygen isn't installed.\n\nPlease use real makefile targets",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12029#issuecomment-356489879,356489879,
