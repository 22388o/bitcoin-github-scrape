luke-jr,2015-02-07T12:37:36Z,That doesn't actually prove anything (other than what was already proven by you submitting the PR)? I'm not implying you need to do anything more to prove it's yours (although it'd be nice if someone verifies it when they meet you in person).\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5764#issuecomment-73362657,73362657,
jonasschnelli,2015-02-07T12:42:26Z,"@luke-jr it just proves again that i'm holding the corresponding priv-key. But right, it was already obvious with the gitian sigs.
