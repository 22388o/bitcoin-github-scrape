Determining the root cause of the IPv6 issue and how to remove it occupied a large amount of our engineering time yesterday, so we hope to be able to begin shipping other fixes more frequently over the coming days.\n> If you're seeing issues and need assistance, please email support@travis-ci.com\n",
