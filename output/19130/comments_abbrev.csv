In general, this kind of documentation would be better in the header file. This also gets included in doxygen etc.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19130#issuecomment-662626299,662626299,

I see now that #19968 included the formula without the script. That's good.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19130#issuecomment-778755507,778755507,
