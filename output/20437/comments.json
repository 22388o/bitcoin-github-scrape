Hence the constant rather than a fuzzer provided value.\r\n\r\nI agree that if we are okay with invalidating seeds then `SetMockTime(ConsumeTime(fuzzed_data_provider));` is obviously the superior choice. (FWIW I'm not opposed to invalidating seeds for these harnesses.)\r\n\r\nI think we still need a constant for the `-mocktime` parameter passed to `BasicTestingSetup` though (for `InitializeFuzzingContext`). Did you have any number in mind that is better than `1`? :)\r\n\r\nI'll fix `SetMockTime(ConsumeTime(fuzzed_data_provider));` and `-mocktime=N` when we've chosen the most appropriate default :)",
