petertodd,2014-02-09T20:08:46Z,IMO sticking the script in the repo under contrib/meta (maint?) isn't a bad idea. A similar use for such a directory would be a script to update/dump the pnSeeds table.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3646#issuecomment-34584590,34584590,
gubatron,2014-02-09T21:30:21Z,"we could do that, but I'd need a little TLC so it takes parameters (year, file extensions to check)... or maybe it just defaults to current year and .cpp and .h. (it was a quick and dirty thing)\n\nI didn't want to suggest since I don't know how you guys feel about adding scripts in more languages, I'm not sure if python is being used already (didn't check)\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3646#issuecomment-34587428,34587428,
petertodd,2014-02-10T00:42:23Z,Personally I'm fine with throwing the script in there as-is so long as its purpose is documented at the top of the script. A quick one or two line summary is fine.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3646#issuecomment-34593320,34593320,
gubatron,2014-02-10T01:45:44Z,"I've fixed the script, however I don't see a contrib/meta folder, I see a contrib/devtools though which has an .sh script and a README. I could add it there and update the readme to explain how to use the script.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3646#issuecomment-34595174,34595174,
petertodd,2014-02-10T01:48:17Z,"Ah, yeah, devtools looks right to me, put it there. I wouldn't bother with a separate README, just use a sane name for the script and put a line or two of comments saying what it is at the top of the script.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3646#issuecomment-34595251,34595251,
gubatron,2014-02-10T02:08:41Z,"Ok, so rebased and pushed.\nThe script has a nice comment up top, and I've added github formatted documentation to the README.md that was on the devtools folder to keep things consistent.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3646#issuecomment-34595986,34595986,
