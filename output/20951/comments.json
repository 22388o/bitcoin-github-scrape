    "body": "> There is no point in engaging in partial spends if it costs less to avoid them.\r\n\r\nIt never will. The coin selection is less restricted when it is allowed to do partial spends. There will either be exactly the same fee, or the fee will be higher for APS.\r\n\r\nThat aside, I'm +/- 0 on your change. The wording changes the perspective from \"avoiding partial spends at the expense of slightly increased fees\" to \"doing partial spend to decrease fees\". I think the latter will confuse existing users as to them there is no decrease, only an increase.\r\n\r\nEdit: actually, I do think the \"difference\" part in the original should be \"increase\". ",
