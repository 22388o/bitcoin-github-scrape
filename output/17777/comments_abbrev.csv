practicalswift,2019-12-23 07:26:30,@promag I'm scratching my own itch with that commit: the current sort order is a mess which makes it unclear where to add a new fuzzer which in turn leads to unnecessary merge conflicts. 3f95fb0 solves that issue once and for all :),https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17777#issuecomment-568384790,568384790,
