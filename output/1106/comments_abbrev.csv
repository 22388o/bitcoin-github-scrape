jgarzik,2012-04-16T06:20:26Z,"Still too many left in the headers, to remove -Wno-sign-compare.  Several key classes exported directly to the network assign and test 'unsigned int' types against -1.  A few other warnings require some thinking as well.  My patches get 75% of the warnings maybe.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1106#issuecomment-5146395,5146395,
