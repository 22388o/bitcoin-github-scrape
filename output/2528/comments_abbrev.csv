Diapolo,2013-04-14T20:26:12Z,You need to squash the 2 commits into one and I still see the indentation issue?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2528#issuecomment-16358748,16358748,

laanwj,2013-04-14T19:05:24Z,"This fix is not correct. It indeed looks like there is currently a fd leak when `file && GetFilesize(file) < 10 * 1000000`, but your change would also cause a fclose in the case that file == NULL (when the debug log cannot be opened; resulting in a segmentation fault).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2528#discussion_r3786482,3786482,src/util.cpp
Diapolo,2013-04-14T19:19:11Z,IMHO it would be sufficient to write:\n`else if (file)`\n\nAnd please also check your indentation below!\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2528#discussion_r3786539,3786539,src/util.cpp
tariq786,2013-04-14T19:24:58Z,i have done the same (IMHO) and fixed the indentation issue as well\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2528#discussion_r3786565,3786565,src/util.cpp
