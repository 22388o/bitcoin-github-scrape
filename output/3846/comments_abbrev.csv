laanwj,2014-03-11T16:27:20Z,"With Qt 5.0.2 I don't see a difference in behavior with or without this patch. I've tried clicking on a parent checkbox with lots of children, but they go to fully selected in either case.\n\nSo probably the problem was introduced later. I'll test with Qt 5.2.x later on.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3846#issuecomment-37316321,37316321,
cozz,2014-03-11T23:05:54Z,"I havent tested 5.0, only 5.2. But the bug is the same on windows and linux, so its a qt thing.\n\nThe added if-statement should be safe, because I explicitly check for the child to be partially selected.\nThis can never happen, unless bug. So if the bug is fixed, the if-statement does not trigger.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3846#issuecomment-37357731,37357731,
