MarcoFalke,2016-06-08T10:09:53Z,Is it required to change the prototypes as well?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8163#discussion_r66228654,66228654,src/rpc/register.h
paveljanik,2016-06-08T10:22:03Z,"In prototypes, you do not need argument names at all, so I expect the change is not needed strictly speaking (edit: I have just verified this...). I did it just for consistency.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8163#discussion_r66230201,66230201,src/rpc/register.h
sipa,2016-08-25T12:56:17Z,I don't think consistency is useful here; using full names is nicer for documentation purposes.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8163#discussion_r76236789,76236789,src/rpc/register.h

mmeijeri,2016-08-25T19:40:02Z,"Agree with sipa: the real solution is to eliminate the global variable, not to use a less descriptive name here.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8163#discussion_r76310892,76310892,src/rpc/register.h
