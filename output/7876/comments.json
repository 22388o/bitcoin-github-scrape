    "body": "@laanwj well, the idea of #7829 is helping new people doing them. I did #7828 as a \"canonical example\" (in fact, I wanted to pass CPolicy at the same time, but ProcessMessage() has waited enough for CPolicy to exist...) and this one because it seems slightly more confusing (or could confuse someone trying to do it for DisconnectTip()). I wouldn't mind doing DisconnectTip() in this PR for that reason.\n\nProbably the less disruptive remaining ones are ConnectBlock(), CheckBlockHeader() and ContextualCheckBlockHeader() [I didn't put ContextualCheckBlock() because @morcos and I want to just destroy the function]. But these seem good exercises for #7829.\n\nBesides that, I must have tried to do CheckBlockHeader() like in 10 different PRs already (probably 5 of them did it before and 5 of them after the cursed consensus moveonly), but I've never tried to get someone else to do it. Perhaps this breaks the curse or something. \n",
