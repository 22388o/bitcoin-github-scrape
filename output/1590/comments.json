    "body": "Reworked a little bit after getting some feedback from the big mining pools (added options -maxblocksize and -maxfreesize).\n\n@luke-jr : I spent most of today looking carefully at how your proposed priority mechanism (the age_weight1 + fee_weight2 formula) and this one actually behave with the transactions that are in the main network's memory pool right now (I implemented just the \"change the priority calculation\" part of #1240 and ran it).\n\nAnd I came to the conclusion that with your scheme it will be hard to get the weights right, and miners will have no idea what they're trading off if we give them the ability to fiddle with the weights.  I wrote the code, and couldn't predict how many free transactions would be included in a block if I made weight1=1 and weight2=1000.\n\nI like this method better; it is clear what will happen if you set -maxblocksize=50000 and -maxfreesize=10000  (defaults are 250,000 and 27,000 which match the behavior of previous releases). \n",
