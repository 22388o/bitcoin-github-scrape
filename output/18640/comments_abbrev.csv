MarcoFalke,2020-04-15 19:25:32,"I am going to go ahead and merge this. If someone finds a way to speed things up, great, we can take them. Though, it doesn't look like clcache speeds things up at all for us. This might be a configuration error or it might be vaporvare, and keeping in the code in the appveyor yaml isn't helping anyone.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18640#issuecomment-614234270,614234270,
