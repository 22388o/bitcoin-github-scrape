MarcoFalke,2020-10-27 11:27:16,"The system has been introduced in #2658 , where it was tested to be working. So it might have been working at one point, but might be broken after commit 4e0eed88acdd41826868c151373068bfad18b84d (not verified, just a guess). Also the bugfix in commit a2f678d3552aaaaa8d6f480cf5f2fbc849f376c3 is presumably incomplete.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19905#issuecomment-717177478,717177478,
MarcoFalke,2020-10-27 11:28:39,"> For the future, I do wonder if it might be better to instead have GetWarnings reach into validation.cpp and perform the comparison between the active tip and pindexBestInvalid when it's needed.\n\nSounds good. To keep the changes here delete-only, I am happy to address the suggestion in a follow-up or volunteer for review if someone beats me to it.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19905#issuecomment-717178155,717178155,
