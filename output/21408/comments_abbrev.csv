Following future commits or rebases which purport to fix the issue, NACK commit_id must be explicitly removed in light of future commits which fix the issue or if the commit_id is no longer present. A commit ID is not sufficient rationale to justify a NACK. NACKs should be placed on the current t",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21408#discussion_r591748254,591748254,CONTRIBUTING.md
MarcoFalke,2021-03-10 18:10:27,I think common sense can be used to derive that a NACK can't be cleared by simply changing the commit_id. Using that many words to describe a simple concept seems overkill and makes the documentation bloated and harder to parse for newcomers (which are the primary audience for this).,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21408#discussion_r591754892,591754892,CONTRIBUTING.md
laanwj,2021-03-10 20:51:48,"Would agree a problem is that commit IDs change all the time when people rebase, amend, etc, I think it's better to NACK by commit title or subject. Or write out your Concept ACK **but** â€¦ it seems this particular situation is rare enough I'm not sure we need a specifically documented abbreviation case for it.
