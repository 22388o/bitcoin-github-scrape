laanwj,2021-05-11 10:08:35,"Ok, added  ""up for grabs"" label. Looks like this is more involved than expected.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21439#issuecomment-838205617,838205617,
laanwj,2021-03-16 18:00:52,"I wonder if we can somehow test the `-daemonwait` functionality here too, that RPC is available and initialized at the time it returns.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21439#discussion_r595416648,595416648,test/functional/feature_daemon_config_args.py
jonatack,2021-03-16 18:11:37,"Agree. ATM the processes launched by `-daemon` and `-daemonwait` remain alive after the test cleanup, so it looks like the framework needs to be updated to deal with these.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21439#discussion_r595424474,595424474,test/functional/feature_daemon_config_args.py
laanwj,2021-03-16 18:19:33,"Agreeâ€¦ Leaking processes is kind of bad.\nFWIW, one of my ideas in #21007 was to use `-daemonwait` in the test framework to avoid having to poll until RPC comes up. I'm not sure it's actually useful for that (due to how we handle logging) though.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21439#discussion_r595430265,595430265,test/functional/feature_daemon_config_args.py
