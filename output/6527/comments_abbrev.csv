jonasschnelli,2015-08-06T06:48:08Z,ACK.\nCouldn't find any details about when files generated with boost::filesystem::unique_path are deleted.\nI think adding a `boost::filesystem::remove(temp);` wouldn't harm?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6527#issuecomment-128269822,128269822,
laanwj,2015-08-06T09:45:12Z,ACK. Using a hardcoded/predictable temporary file name can be dangerous.\n\nAnd agree with @jonasschnelli that the test should try to clean up after itself.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6527#issuecomment-128310575,128310575,
casey,2015-08-06T14:16:52Z,@jonasschnelli @laanwj It actually does clean up after itself; there's a call to `boost::filesystem::remove(temp)` at the end of the function.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6527#issuecomment-128384710,128384710,
jonasschnelli,2015-08-06T14:19:26Z,@casey: Ah. Now i see how this works. The `boost::filesystem::remove(temp);` removed in this PR was there because the file was not really a random tmp file.\n\nACK.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6527#issuecomment-128386904,128386904,

casey,2015-08-06T14:15:51Z,Isn't the right indentation four spaces? Or is it different for a line continuation?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6527#discussion_r36418799,36418799,src/test/alert_tests.cpp
jonasschnelli,2015-08-06T14:17:19Z,Meh. Sorry. I oversaw the line break... all good!\nYou can always use `clang-format -i <file>` if you wan't to confirm to the code-style-guidelines.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6527#discussion_r36418979,36418979,src/test/alert_tests.cpp
