ajtowns,2020-10-08 22:24:04,"I don't think mocktime makes sense for any chain that's shared amongst untrusted peers; ie setting mocktime on testnet and the default signet wouldn't make sense. If you use -regtest when you've got trusted peers (it's quicker than a custom signet) and a custom signet when you have untrusted peers (since -regtest is trivial to abuse), then the ""mocktime only on -regtest"" is a perfect match.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20103#issuecomment-705854842,705854842,
