rebroad,2013-04-02T01:22:21Z,"This should certainly require a BIP. As a side note, I wonder if adding a timeout value to getdata is worthwhile also - i.e. most nodes wait 2 minutes before requesting a tx or block elsewhere. If a node responds more than 2 hours later it's only likely to be sending something the node already has. a timeout would allow the node to decide whether the requesting node is still interested.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2192#issuecomment-15748163,15748163,
