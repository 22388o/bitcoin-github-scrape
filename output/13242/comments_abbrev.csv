kallewoof,2018-05-16T01:05:44Z,"@Empact Thanks! Wow, this was added because of false positive test failures? I don't know if I can agree with that decision. Hard to test a fix though (no PPC/MIPS here).",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13242#issuecomment-389362095,389362095,
sipa,2018-05-16T01:09:04Z,"NACK, this is invalid C++. You cannot take a pointer to an object of type A and then dereference it as a pointer of type B, unless the types are compatible, or B is a char type.\n\nThis will likely work on little-endian systems, but will produce different results on big-endian ones. And regardless of architecture, this is undefined behaviour.\n\nFWIW, on x86 `ReadLE64` is compiled to a simple load",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13242#issuecomment-389362591,389362591,

kallewoof,2018-05-16T01:21:54Z,"OK, I tried switching to `ReadBE64` from `ReadLE64` and the addrman tests are failing all over the place. If this hash is a hash, that makes no sense whatsoever.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13242#issuecomment-389364500,389364500,
kallewoof,2018-05-16T05:16:38Z,I updated the tests to work on big endian. I also addressed @sipa's point about not dereferencing different type. ,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13242#issuecomment-389396949,389396949,
