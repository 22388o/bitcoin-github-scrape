jonasschnelli,2015-05-19T11:57:15Z,@laanwj: QWindow is actually a non QWidget subclass and would require some adaptation to make it work as it is now.\n\nNow i went for the most easy solution: adding a `Qt::Window` flag for the widget. This should be sufficient to make the debug window act as a normal window. \n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6155#issuecomment-103459156,103459156,
laanwj,2015-05-19T14:51:03Z,"Right. That's fine.\n\nFrom http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qwindow.html :\n""An application will typically use QWidget or QQuickView for its UI, and not QWindow directly""\n\nQWidget is the correct type to use.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6155#issuecomment-103533513,103533513,
jonasschnelli,2015-05-19T14:53:13Z,But i'm not sure if this is even required. I can't reproduce #5908.\nBut adding the `Qt::Window` flag for the console widget should anyway be the right thing.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6155#issuecomment-103534646,103534646,
laanwj,2015-05-19T14:55:33Z,It should get added automatically when there is no parent widget.\nForcing the flag on will likely give problems when the debug console is embedded in the main window (as when running in Node mode).\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6155#issuecomment-103536187,103536187,
