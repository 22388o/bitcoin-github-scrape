laanwj,2017-07-13T15:34:43Z,"If you're going to do this anyway, why not allow overriding the port? (e.g. pass port instead of dummy_port, to make it possible to override the rpcport)\n\nAfter all, the point of bracketed addresses is to allow `[ip]:port` specifications unambigiously.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10812#discussion_r127251780,127251780,src/bitcoin-cli.cpp
jnewbery,2017-07-13T17:15:09Z,"I chose not to allow overriding the port since we already have the `-rpcport` option, and this is the minimal functional change.\n\nI'm equally happy to make the one-line change so `-rpcconnect` can accept `<address>:<port>`. I have zero preference either way and I'm happy to go along with consensus opinion. @theuni has already expressed slight preference for allowing a port number in `-rpcconne",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10812#discussion_r127276640,127276640,src/bitcoin-cli.cpp
laanwj,2017-07-13T18:08:58Z,"I'd really prefer to be able to override the port in rpcconnect.\nFYI we have a similar thing at the server side with `bind` which can either take a address and port (overriding `-port`) or just an address (in which case `-port` is used).\nIf not I'd rather NACK this. It is just confusing to parse an `[ip]:port` spec if you're going to ignore the port.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10812#discussion_r127290082,127290082,src/bitcoin-cli.cpp
jnewbery,2017-07-13T21:16:32Z,"sure - changed to use the port from `-rpcconnect` if it's specified.\n\nIt was a bit more than a one line change because it was a little fiddly to get the precedence correct:\n\n1. -rpcport if there is one; else\n2. port in -rpcconnect if there is one; else\n3. default port for the chain",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10812#discussion_r127332999,127332999,src/bitcoin-cli.cpp
