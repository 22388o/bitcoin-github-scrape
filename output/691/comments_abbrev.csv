Regardless of whether the ""minimize to tray"" option is on or not.\nI agree that the temporary shifting around is a bit hacky.\nFixing it in `BitcoinGUI::changeEvent` might be more elegant, but as far as I can see we'd need to introduce some variable to indicate whether the program is starting up or not, since it's only in the startup phase t",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/691#issuecomment-3088902,3088902,
runeksvendsen,2011-12-10T03:46:28Z,Which tools are you using to debug stuff like this? I'd like to know if BitcoinGUI::trayIconActivated is called when I click the tray icon when it's in its non-responding state. I've tried printf's and message boxes but they seem to not work so well... Are you just using gdb?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/691#issuecomment-3089040,3089040,
laanwj,2011-12-10T09:06:57Z,"Regarding -min not working in latest master: doubly weird, the only thing that's changed is that the constructor of BitcoinGUI no longer calls `show()`. This is the normal behavior for Qt widgets; the client decides whether, and when to show it.\n\nOverriding `BitcoinGUI::showMinimized` was my initial idea. But AFAIK you can't avoid the changeEvent there either, so end up with a similar hack. It'd",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/691#issuecomment-3089933,3089933,
luke-jr,2011-12-24T19:33:44Z,"FWIW, on my system with current master (5ad2ca0), -min ignores the ""minimize to system tray"" setting, and starts minimized normally. I consider this a bug.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/691#issuecomment-3268823,3268823,
