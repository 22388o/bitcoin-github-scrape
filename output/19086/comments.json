    "body": "Thanks for helping with translations! However, changes to translations as well as new translations are submitted to [Bitcoin Core's Transifex page](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/bitcoin/).\r\n\r\nTranslations are periodically pulled from Transifex and merged into the git repository. See the [translation process](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/translation_process.md) for details on how this works. So we do not accept translation changes as GitHub pull requests because the next pull from Transifex would automatically overwrite them again.",
