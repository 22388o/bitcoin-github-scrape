It doesn't really make sense to say which of 0.19.n or 0.20.m is earlier, since they're parallel release tracks. In #21469, the first release is 0.21.1, and in #20861, the first release is 22.0.\n\nI also don't think that a 0.19 backport is necessary, but others may disagree.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21470#discussion_r601794556,601794556,doc/bips.md
