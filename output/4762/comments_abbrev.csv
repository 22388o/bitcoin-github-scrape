TheBlueMatt,2014-08-27T02:15:11Z,Why keep chunks by date instead of by total size (as bitcoind does anyway)?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4762#issuecomment-53519049,53519049,
jgarzik,2014-08-27T03:40:12Z,"Date is more human-centric and useful to some queries.  ""ls -l"" will therefore produce useful, date-based information.  ""ls -l"" tells you which files contain data from >= 2014, etc.  No need to scan the files to determine that.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4762#issuecomment-53523491,53523491,

jgarzik,2014-08-27T19:55:06Z,"Let me slay this shed painting, of which I am also guilty, by noting that the script fully supports split-by-file-size as a criterion, via configuration file setting.\n\nThe default is split-by-size.  Default of ""max_out_sz"" is 1000L \* 1000 \* 1000 bytes.\n\nThis commit adds a non-default split-by-date, enabled via config file.\n\nIt is my fault for not being more explicit about the capabilities ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4762#issuecomment-53630790,53630790,
