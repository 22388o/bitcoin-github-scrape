achow101,2018-07-16T05:16:45Z,@ken2812221 It works for me. Maybe you need to run it as root (with `sudo`) or set docker to run [without root](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user). ,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13368#issuecomment-405150963,405150963,

MarcoFalke,2018-06-22T15:33:31Z,@achow101 Is this hash even supposed to be deterministic or does it just serve the purpose of an unique identifier?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13368#discussion_r197484329,197484329,contrib/gitian-build.sh
