Bypassing the limit makes this prone to accidentally abusive use by confused users (I've very frequently seen people add addnode lists with hundreds of nodes expecting it to make their nodes faster, when doing so has the opposite effect), and the 5 second retry is itself abusive (e.g. imagine a popularly known node that is full with hundreds of people addnoding it).\n\nI'd have no complaint with fixing it so that addnoded peers took priority over other connections and bumped them out, or starting at 5 seconds and doing a capped exponential backoff off on retries though.\n",
