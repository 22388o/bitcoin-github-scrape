    "body": "@TheBlueMatt I gave it some thought. I was getting ready to add the logic to try the first url, then an optional 2nd url, then the fallback url (#4752) if those failed. Realistically, the upstream url and our self-hosted fallback should be enough I'd think. If both of those fail, a backup link isn't likely to work either, and we'd just end up with a set of backup urls that are rarely tested, and are probably long-stale.\n",
