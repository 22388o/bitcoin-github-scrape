sdaftuar,2016-03-05T11:58:02Z,"Needed rebase.\n\n@sipa Regarding your comment about adding exact ancestor state checking to `CTxMemPool::check()` (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7600#issuecomment-192487265), my only concern with adding that was slowing down the test suite to a potentially unacceptable level.  I'm timing that now...\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7594#issuecomment-192626732,192626732,
sdaftuar,2016-03-08T20:55:11Z,"I tried adding complete ancestor-state checks to `CTxMemPool::check()` and timed the rpc tests (with `-extended`), and I saw negligible difference in times (<5%), so I've gone ahead and pushed that commit here.  \n\nI do expect this to be substantially slower, but I assume that since we can now run on mainnet with `-checkmempool=<N>` with N > 1 that we can just use bigger values of N if necessary.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7594#issuecomment-193962259,193962259,

dgenr8,2016-03-12T02:25:31Z,"In `CalculateMempoolAncestors`, how about wrapping the limit checks in `if (fSearchForParents)`?  These checks should be unnecessary if entry is already in the mempool.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7594#issuecomment-195639561,195639561,
sdaftuar,2016-03-14T16:09:04Z,"@dgenr8 I agree that refactoring that code would make that function clearer, but as the content of `CalculateMemPoolAncestors()` hasn't changed in this PR, I'd like to defer that refactor to a separate pull, to avoid making this PR any more difficult to review than it already is.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7594#issuecomment-196387449,196387449,
