sipa,2014-05-07T14:25:46Z,"Wild idea: add an RPC getrpcinfo, which returns structured information (number of arguments, types, help text) about all known RPC calls.\n\nbitrpc.py could then be extended with tab-completion, automatic type conversion, batch requests, ... and we can maybe phase out bitcoin-cli :)\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4144#issuecomment-42433350,42433350,

sipa,2014-05-07T14:43:01Z,"@d3rrial About all. And I mean structured, so that the python script can interpret it to know what RPC calls exist. For help, it would need to go parse the output and guess.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4144#issuecomment-42435625,42435625,
insunaa,2014-05-07T14:45:09Z,"@sipa It would def. help rpc clients remain compatible with newer versions even if parameters were added or removed for example, so I guess it's worth taking a look at\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4144#issuecomment-42435922,42435922,
insunaa,2014-05-08T13:13:56Z,"@sipa Well... I tried something like this now, but it's incredibly static.

insunaa,2014-05-07T12:47:37Z,"Yes it will.\nI don't see how this would make it any more insecure from the password being in the startup parameter, where it is just as visible to any passerby, tho.\nThe idea of this addition was to make the password disappear from log-files, not to make it invisible to people in the vicinity\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4144#discussion_r12374075,12374075,src/rpcclient.cpp

insunaa,2014-05-07T12:58:59Z,"That is a good point.\nI was assuming more users would use bitcoind than the python rpc client, but I don't have any metrics to support that assumption. Thank you.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4144#discussion_r12374520,12374520,src/rpcclient.cpp
laanwj,2014-05-07T13:09:45Z,Yeah - Python is superior for this. Implementing the equivalent in c++ would either pull in extra dependencies or be very OS-specific.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4144#discussion_r12375008,12375008,src/rpcclient.cpp
