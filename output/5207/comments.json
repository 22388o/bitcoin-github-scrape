    "body": "Thanks for the feedback.\n\nI agree, it's a little awkward. My main reason for the key-value pair was to make sure that users did not think that the hex-encoded hash was part of the hex-encoded transaction. I can bring it all onto one line since it's a new flag that won't break anybody yet.\n\nThree options that come to mind:\n1) Like Jeff said: {\"txid\":\"hex tx hash\", \"tx\":\"hex tx\"}\n2) hex tx,hex tx hash\n3) tx=hex tx,txid=hex tx hash\n\nOption 1 is clean and makes sense to look at.\nOption 2 is easier to command line script (e.g.- use \"cut\" instead of going to python, ruby, etc...).\nOption 3 is a mix.\n\nI kind of like option 2 for scripting ease, but it's not a strong preference.\nI'll update to use Jeff's idea (option 1) if I don't get any conflicting feedback within a few hours.\n",
