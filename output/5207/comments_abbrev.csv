jgarzik,2014-11-04T19:51:45Z,No objection to outputting the hash _somewhere_.  The norm is providing the txid and hex-encoded TX in JSON output.\n\nProviding the hash as a key=value line separate from the hex-encoded output is a bit odd.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5207#issuecomment-61702817,61702817,
mruddy,2014-11-04T20:33:23Z,"Thanks for the feedback.\n\nI agree, it's a little awkward. My main reason for the key-value pair was to make sure that users did not think that the hex-encoded hash was part of the hex-encoded transaction. I can bring it all onto one line since it's a new flag that won't break anybody yet.\n\nThree options that come to mind:\n1) Like Jeff said: {""txid"":""hex tx hash"", ""tx"":""hex tx""}\n2) hex tx,hex",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5207#issuecomment-61709440,61709440,
jgarzik,2014-11-04T20:57:35Z,"Another option is ""-hash"" command line option, which _only_ outputs the hash.  That turns some operations into a two-step process, but is clean and util-friendly.  No 'cut' or 'awk' required.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5207#issuecomment-61713048,61713048,
mruddy,2014-11-04T22:15:39Z,"Good idea Jeff! I've incorporated both of your inputs. Now, there is a ""-hash"" that outputs only the computed transaction hash. There is also a new ""-hexhash"" that creates the JSON formatted output containing both the hex-encoded transaction and the hex-encoded transaction id. I like this updated commit much more than my original submission.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5207#issuecomment-61724924,61724924,
jgarzik,2014-11-04T22:21:18Z,"For the latter, I would recommend simply modifying the ""-json"" output to include the txid and hex-encoded tx.\n\nThat then mirrors what bitcoind produces in some of its output, such as 'getrawtransaction' when 'verbose' flag is true.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5207#issuecomment-61725726,61725726,
mruddy,2014-11-04T23:11:27Z,"Ah, cool, I wasn't aware of that, even better.\nI looked at getrawtransaction and this latest commit changes course a bit in order to be consistent with that.\nNow, there are -txid and -verbose options instead of -hash and -hexhash.\nThe -txid is the case where we only show the hex-encoded transaction id/hash.\nThe -verbose option now simply adds the ""hex"" member to the JSON output. This also make",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5207#issuecomment-61732487,61732487,
jgarzik,2014-11-04T23:13:53Z,"I think we are pretty close.  Consider that bitcoind interprets ""verbose"" as implying the entire JSON output.  i.e. ""not verbose"" is the hex-encoded binary form.\n\nTherefore, (1) -txid as you have it and (2) added ""hex"" to JSON output should be sufficient.  No need for an additional -verbose.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5207#issuecomment-61732805,61732805,
mruddy,2014-11-04T23:29:36Z,"OK, what I hear you saying is that requesting JSON output is synonymous with requesting verbose output in this context. Sounds fine, commit updated.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5207#issuecomment-61734532,61734532,
