ajtowns,2017-08-07T02:07:43Z,"@jnewbery Hmm, looking at #10267 in a bit more detail, the current patch seems to only allow a single includeconf directive to have an effect anyway, rather than multiple includes or recursive includes; so you could actually get the same effect as that patch with this one by just giving an absolute path to the netconf directory here.

ajtowns,2017-11-21T21:49:08Z,"@MeshCollider In normal usage, -netconf isn't needed -- you just add the network.conf file to .bitcoin/testnet3/ (or wherever) if you want to use it, and you don't if you don't want to use it.

This removes the need for the netconf argument. Reasoning is that if a user specified a config file they probably want to use it on the network they specify as well, so we really only need to change the default behaviour.
