tkembo,2014-05-28T17:37:33Z,OK. I'll wait a while to see if there are any other suggestions before squashing the 3 commits into one\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4213#issuecomment-44439950,44439950,
Diapolo,2014-05-28T20:31:13Z,I'd also suggest to use `https://www.openssl.org` over the http link.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4213#issuecomment-44460424,44460424,
tkembo,2014-06-02T07:32:22Z,OK. I've just squashed the commits into one commit and changed the http://www.openssl.org to https://www.openssl.org\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4213#issuecomment-44808893,44808893,

tkembo,2014-05-23T06:19:40Z,I wouldn't call it a lot of noise and I think it's a necessary evil. The noise is only just before or just after a hyperlinks and those need no translation.

Diapolo,2014-05-28T20:30:10Z,"IMHO this text could also be set just in the aboutdialog constructor (in utilitydialog.cpp) and we could then use `ui->label_2->setText(""Blabla %1... dadada %2... etc... %3"").arg(""http://www.foo.bar"").arg(""http://www.foo2.bar"").arg(""http://www.foo3.bar"")`.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4213#discussion_r13153950,13153950,src/qt/forms/aboutdialog.ui
