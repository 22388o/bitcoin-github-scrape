JBaczuk,2018-11-09T14:25:50Z,"I agree, maybe `doc/RPC-interface.md` is a better solution, the only problem is that many users will not know about the new doc. Perhaps the incentive to dig a little is great enough. I wonder if the `doc/RPC-interface.md` would be too difficult to maintain, e.g. the manpages are is generated deterministically.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14448#issuecomment-437374705,437374705,

ryanofsky,2018-11-12T21:40:21Z,"I disagree with meshcollider and promag, and think this information is useful. Or at least I don't understand how it harms anyone. I hate documentation that just gives me a handwavy gloss about how an option is intended to be used without saying what it actually does.\n\nOf course it would also be good to document wallet endpoints in markdown.

laanwj,2018-11-23T08:57:04Z,"I generally don't think the option help is the place to put very detailed specifications (just like the release notes are not !), but in this case I kind of like it because it's short and directly illustrates what it does.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14448#discussion_r235874288,235874288,src/bitcoin-cli.cpp
