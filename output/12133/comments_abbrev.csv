MarcoFalke,2018-01-10T21:46:23Z,"In `test_non_standard_witness`, you subtract the fee at some point. Having really small outputs, this could lead to negative outputs, provoking the ""bad-txns-vout-negative"". The smallest observed value depends on the test run and the exception is hit very rarely non-deterministically.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12133#issuecomment-356747291,356747291,
