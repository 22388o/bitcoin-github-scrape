Ran `test/functional/interface_bitcoin_cli.py` in which all tests were successful.\r\n\r\nLooked over code for the other improvements/clean up in this pr and all looks okay to me.\r\n\r\nI agree that the `-` should stay in order to keep consistency with the other commands and changing the error message on `bitcoin-cli generate` to point towards `-generate` as a fallback seems sensible to me.",
