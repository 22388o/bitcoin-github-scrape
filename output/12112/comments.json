While we were discussing this change (admittedly, I was against it), I asked repeatedly for documentation to be written to accompany it because I thought the usage was complex and confusing.\r\n\r\nI think it's best when documentation and code changes are made at the same time. It prevents mistakes, makes code easier to review, and can even lead to better designs because often writing documentation causes you to look at things from a different perspective.",
