NicolasDorier,2017-07-28T10:11:07Z,"For this PR to work, I would need to save `CWitKeyID` and `CWitKScriptID` from the `mapAddressBook` into `CWalletDB`. Problem is, now `CBitcoinAddress` is used to serialized `TxDestination` into string. This mean that `CBitcoinAddress` would need to support Bech32 or completely removed into another system (a new visitor?).\n\nI think this PR will become useful for 0.15.1, so I am not closing it.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10947#issuecomment-318615236,318615236,
