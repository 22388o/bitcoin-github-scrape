MarcoFalke,2021-06-19 10:45:45,I like the error message on typos of the arguments and slightly prefer the alternative solution presented here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/56349168/2084795,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22201#discussion_r654781088,654781088,test/functional/test_framework/test_framework.py
theStack,2021-06-19 10:56:19,"Nice idea.

josibake,2021-06-21 15:17:37,"great call out, @MarcoFalke , i confirmed this does silently accept typos in cli args, which would be super hard to debug when using the test args from the command line.\n\ni updated to the linked solution and, per @theStack 's comment, confirmed this was the only extra argument being passed. it doesn't guarantee new arguments wont pop up in the future and break this, but it seems better to use ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22201#discussion_r655472025,655472025,test/functional/test_framework/test_framework.py
