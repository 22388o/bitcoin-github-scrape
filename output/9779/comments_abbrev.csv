MarcoFalke,2017-02-16T21:49:12Z,"I assume the rationale is that testnet is super flaky and it is better\nto be conservative in what block to assume valid, as it has to be part\nof a valid chain to have any effect.\n\n...

gmaxwell,2017-02-17T03:01:51Z,"@jtimon we only set the assumevalid back because the chain might reorg.  But even if the chain reorgs the work will be strictly equal or better.  So the chainwork should be set as far forward as possible, but assumevalid may need to be set back to avoid reorgs.
