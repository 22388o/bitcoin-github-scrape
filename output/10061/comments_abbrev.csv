TheBlueMatt,2017-05-08T20:36:22Z,"@theuni ping Seems this stuff could generally use a cleanup (merge SetSocketNonBlocking/SetSocketNoDelay, also do we need to set SO_NOSIGPIPE on the newly-listened socket (looks like it inherits), maybe would be nice to merge that too?\n\nAnyway, utACK ad415bc16afdb4fdb6d619624762f1324751a824 this itself, its still a strict improvement.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10061#issuecomment-299983326,299983326,

paveljanik,2017-03-23T06:35:22Z,I don't like this ;-) #ifdef in the middle of the function is worst in my eyes than the previuos solution.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10061#discussion_r107596605,107596605,src/netbase.cpp
tjps,2017-03-23T07:03:11Z,"You mean in the middle of the function call?  I agree it looks visually worse, but I like deduplicating code as much as possible.\n\nHowever on longer consideration, I realized that the conversion from (const char*) to (const void*) will happen implicitly on any platform, so this ifdef isn't even needed.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10061#discussion_r107599504,107599504,src/netbase.cpp
laanwj,2017-04-03T11:39:48Z,"Indeed, seems like the WIN32 check was unnecessary, every pointer can be passed to a `void*` parameter including `char*` so the redundant cast doesn't matter.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10061#discussion_r109396085,109396085,src/netbase.cpp
laanwj,2017-04-03T11:41:46Z," I'd feel slightly better with `rc == 0`. 0 is guaranteed to be the success value both in Windows and UNIX, whereas on failure [windows returns](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms740476(v=vs.85).aspx) `SOCKET_ERROR` (which may or may not be -1, it's not mentioned).",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10061#discussion_r109396419,109396419,src/netbase.cpp
tjps,2017-04-05T18:32:24Z,"But of course, I usually idiomatically check rc == 0 from system calls.  Not sure why I went with != -1.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10061#discussion_r109993849,109993849,src/netbase.cpp
