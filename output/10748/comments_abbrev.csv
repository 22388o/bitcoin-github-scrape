I'm not keen on doing that unless people think this is an improvement and should get merged.\n\n@laanwj @jonasschnelli you've both taken a look at this and left comments. Can I assume concept ACKs from you? Do you think this is an improvement?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10748#issuecomment-322223616,322223616,

jonasschnelli,2017-07-13T07:31:55Z,I think a possible solution would be to have a signal for collecting help strings. The signal emitter then could take care of sorting the groups.

jnewbery,2017-07-13T11:59:20Z,"> possible solution would be to have a signal for collecting help strings\n\nCertainly possible to have a signal for wallet to pass its help strings to server, but qt also has its own help strings (bitcoind should also have its own help string for `-server`, but that's actually implemented in init.cpp for now). Difficult to see where/how those would all be sorted.\n\nReally I don't think it ma",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10748#discussion_r127197060,127197060,src/qt/utilitydialog.cpp
