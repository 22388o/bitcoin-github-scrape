sipa,2013-08-25T15:59:54Z,"Unless serious objections are raised by the community, ACK. A python reference miner sounds good, but can wait, I guess. We should probably at least remove contrib/pyminer in this pullreq too, though.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2905#issuecomment-23230189,23230189,
jgarzik,2013-08-26T02:18:29Z,"Rebased, and fixed a couple comment bugs.\n\nConsidered removing contrib/pyminer, but decided that was best left for a separate commit.  I agree it would be nice to update pyminer, or another simple reference miner, to use getblocktemplate.  Maybe cpuminer, with all assembly, 4way, etc. stripped out would fit the bill better than updating pyminer.\n\nThe person who does the work will decide, I ima",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2905#issuecomment-23240825,23240825,

doublec,2013-08-26T04:47:01Z,That comment was from me. I'm not opposed to getwork being removed although I do currently use it. If I choose to continue supporting getwork I can back it with GBT. I'll need to stick to an older bitcoind until I get this done of course but I backport security issues to what I'm running when I can. \n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2905#issuecomment-23243480,23243480,
