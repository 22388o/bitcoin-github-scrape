jnewbery,2017-08-10T15:45:43Z,"I'm not sure this change is worth it when there are just two bip9 softforks. This is a net +ve LOC change for the same functionality.\n\nPerhaps worth revisiting if we get more bip9 softforks in future, or am I missing some benefit?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10874#issuecomment-321591414,321591414,
achow101,2017-08-10T16:51:44Z,It's fine to do this in the future when we have more soft forks. I had only made the change since I needed to add stats about BIP 91 to one of my branches and the fact that the forks needed to be hard coded in to be displayed with `getblockchaininfo` bothered me.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10874#issuecomment-321609838,321609838,
