We don't have a way to \"commit\" a transaction except for \"sendrawtransaction\", which also sends it. \r\n\r\nAt least it should be documented very well. Otherwise people may be running `fundrawtransaction` in a loop with slightly different parameters, throwing away the transactions and wondering why they race through the mempool so quickly.\r\n\r\nI think the change in this pull is a good idea in any case.

    "body": "@jonasschnelli If the wallet is not unlocked-- you can't. But just because something good can't be done all the time that doesn't mean we shouldn't do it when we can, unless there is some downsie.  Failing to do it doesn't make anything actually work better and it means that even unlock+rescan won't just work when otherwise it would.\r\n\r\nIf key number 95 is used we should mark it and all keys before it as used. If that ends up leaving us with an empty keypool-- ok! thats better than silently reusing addresses. If the keypool is made larger like 1000 or 10000 addresses this is less of an issue and we could also periodically prompt the user to unlock when it gets low.",

    "body": "I really don't like the unreliable behaviour that would follow from this. People may test their software with unencrypted wallet, and then in production a recovery is attempted and keys are missed - forcing the operator to do a full rescan (or if they were pruning, a full resync).\r\n\r\nI think I prefer just increasing the keypool size.
