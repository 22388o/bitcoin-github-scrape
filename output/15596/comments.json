    "body": "Since some people reading the release notes are probably going to end up here confused (I did),  I thought it would be useful to write my understanding here.\r\n\r\nThe min_conf argument to sendmany was functionally part of the now gone \"accounts\" system.  ... that's also why it was only an argument to sendmany and not sendtoaddress, since  sendmany had an account parameter (and as luke-noted, sendtoaddress was soft-deprecated).\r\n\r\nThe accounts system was intended to provide the backing logic for a shared user wallet (in particular, mybitcoin which went away after \"losing\" half its users funds).  Especially after the mental model of UTXO and such started becoming understood by users, accounts functions were commonly misunderstood to be coincontrol features, but they never were: The wallet was written almost entirely with the view that the underlying output model would be hidden from the user. And for a shared-wallet it would be generally undesirable to have multiple users mean separate wallets because of the loss of fee efficiency, in any case.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of min_conf was accurately documented in the help: Use the _balance_ according to a specified number of confirmations. This did not mean use the coins of a specific depth: remember accounts were not a coin-control feature, and the abstraction of coins was originally intended to be completely hidden from the users.\r\n\r\nThe reason an accounts-based shared wallet would want to use this is to prevent an attack where a user deposits some coins, waits for 1 conf (so their balance goes up) then withdraw that amount (which they can because their balance is high enough) which then ends up selecting some different >6 conf coins (since that is coinselection's extremely strong preference) ... then reorg the chain 1 block to claw their payment back while leaving the withdraw in place. ... leaving the user with a negative balance which they never repay.    By setting min_conf to 6, a permitted payment would not result in the user's balance becoming negative if there was a 6 or fewer block reorg + doublespend.\r\n\r\nThough I'm not sure of it, I would be surprised if this option wasn't added in direct response to actual losses.\r\n\r\nSince the accounts system is gone, this setting doesn't have a real use anymore AFAICT.  It probably would have been better if the release notes had said that, rather than suggesting some coin-controlly things which this setting never accomplished, not intended to accomplish, nor was documented to accomplish.\r\n\r\nIt's possible someone was using it to make sure they didn't overspend relative to their well confirmed coins and end up insolvent and owing people for payments in the event of a reorg beyond what they can make good for-- but I doubt it.  If so, I believe there is currently no alternative functionality available for them (certainly not any of the options mentioned in the release notes).\r\n\r\nNor could the setting really have been re-purposed to some coin control-ish purpose, even though filtering your coins by depth is a pretty reasonable ask--  because change and third party payments really need to be treated distinctly if you do that kind of filtering because otherwise any filtering means you can't use your own change which is *extremely* disruptive and surprising, particularly since the interface mostly hides the fact that transacting temporarily kicks an essentially random amount of your balance to unconfirmed status. Any kind of min_conf coin control setting would probably need to work like the coin-selection does and have a separate argument for change (which would almost always be kept at the default of 0). ... maybe such a feature would even need three categories (immature coinbases) or four (change from segwit-only txn should probably be handled differently!). yuck: coin control is hard.\r\n",
