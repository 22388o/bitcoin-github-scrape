MarcoFalke,2015-11-19T19:40:18Z,"Nit: Shouldn't the `print` appear in front of `assert`? So when it fails, we know where it did (Not just by line number)?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7063#discussion_r45389636,45389636,qa/rpc-tests/prioritise_transaction.py
MarcoFalke,2015-11-19T19:41:46Z,Long overdue to have this moved to the test framework. Thanks!\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7063#discussion_r45389845,45389845,qa/rpc-tests/smartfees.py
sdaftuar,2015-11-19T20:30:34Z,"Well then it would be printing something incorrect if the assertion failed.  I guess I could add a different print statement above the asserts, but not sure it's worth it?  If the assertion fails I think the stack trace is informative enough, and I don't think the style here is inconsistent with the rest of the tests.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7063#discussion_r45396046,45396046,qa/rpc-tests/prioritise_transaction.py
MarcoFalke,2015-11-19T22:10:13Z,"Where would you put a comment, when you had put one? Then just replace the `#` with `print` and you get in L109:\n\n`print ""Assert that prioritised transaction was mined""`\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7063#discussion_r45408476,45408476,qa/rpc-tests/prioritise_transaction.py
MarcoFalke,2015-11-19T22:10:57Z,> rest of the tests\n\nI see no reason to do this. You could as well just remove the `print` completely.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7063#discussion_r45408554,45408554,qa/rpc-tests/prioritise_transaction.py
