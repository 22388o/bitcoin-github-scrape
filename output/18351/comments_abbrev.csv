If you do still want to follow up with this change, I'm going to suggest re-opening your PR in the gui repo: https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui. There are currently a few other tooltip/text related PRs open there as well.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18351#issuecomment-658584150,658584150,
