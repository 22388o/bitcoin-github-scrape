Libsecp256k1 is a cryptographic library\n+optimized for the curve Bitcoin uses which was created by Bitcoin\n+Core developer Pieter Wuille.\n+\n+There exist attacks[1] against most ECC implementations where an\n+attacker on shared virtual machine hardware could extract a private\n+key if they could cause a target to sign using the same key hundreds\n+of times. While using shared hosts and reusing keys are inadvisable\n+for other reasons, it's a better practice to avoid the exposure.\n+\n+OpenSSL has code in their source repository for derandomization\n+and reduction in timing leaks, and we've  eagerly wanted to use\n+it for a long time but this functionality has still not made its\n+way into a released version of OpenSSL. Libsecp256k1 achieves\n+significantly stronger protection: As far as we're aware this is\n+the only deployed implementation of constant time signing for\n+the curve Bitcoin uses and we have reason to believe that\n+libsecp256k1 is better tested and more thoroughly reviewed\n+than the implementation in OpenSSL.\n+\n+[1] https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/161.pdf"
