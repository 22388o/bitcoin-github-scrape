morcos,2016-08-04T21:54:39Z,NACK these changes\n\nIt's important to explain the changes so that miners can make educated decisions on how to use the code.  `blockmaxweight` is now the consensus enforced limit and I think its pretty relevant to explain to miners that using that is the most direct way to create blocks that maximize fees while being consensus compatible.

In that situation, we are able to skip the call to CalculateMemPoolAncestors.
