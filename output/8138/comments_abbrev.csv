dcousens,2016-06-02T15:11:28Z,> Perhaps we should also reduce the number 288. Maybe a limit specified in number of transactions is better?\n\nOr perhaps a limit specified in size on disk?  Last 288MB as an example.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8138#issuecomment-223322356,223322356,
kazcw,2016-06-05T22:04:06Z,"The relationship between -checkblocks and -checkmaxtx is not clear from the help text. It looks like as implemented it will stop when either limit is reached, modulo the `MIN_BLOCK_TO_RESPECT_WITH_MAX_TX_CHECK` logic (i.e. they are both maxes). Unless there's a particular benefit to the max-based interface, I think I would prefer if they were both mins, which would also obviate `MIN_BLOCK_TO_RESPE",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8138#issuecomment-223840650,223840650,
sipa,2016-08-25T12:08:57Z,"You could also just get rid of MIN_BLOCK_TO_RESPECT_WITH_MAX_TX_CHECK. The theoretical maximum number of transactions in a block is 16665 anyway, so 100000 transactions effectively already requires 7 blocks anyway. If someone wants to set a lower number of transactions, so bit it.\n\nThat would simplify this PR, and have clearer semantics.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8138#issuecomment-242363410,242363410,
