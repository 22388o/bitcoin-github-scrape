    "body": "@promag I tried to work on a solution based on always providing the entire `params` object recursively normalized, keeping the originals around as well, but it is very easy to mess up. For example if I convert send and leave FundTransaction as it is, the updated send will now put new normalized keys in the options and FundTransaction will fail to find those, even though the initial code had copied everything.\r\n\r\nSince it also adds to named parameters, patches are needed in various places to make it not yell about missing or unknown parameters.\r\n\r\nStill digging, but this seems to increase complexity quite a bit.",
