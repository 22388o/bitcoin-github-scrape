However, if a test\n+  fails, the `test_framework.log` and bitcoind `debug.log`s will all be dumped\n+  to the console to help troubleshooting.\n+\n+To change the level of logs output to the console, use the `-l` command line\n+argument.\n+\n+`test_framework.log` and bitcoind `debug.log`s can be combined into a single\n+aggregate log by running the `combine_logs.py` script. The output can be plain\n+text, colorized text or html.

However, if a test\n+  fails, the `test_framework.log` and bitcoind `debug.log`s will all be dumped\n+  to the console to help troubleshooting.\n+\n+To change the level of logs output to the console, use the `-l` command line\n+argument.\n+\n+`test_framework.log` and bitcoind `debug.log`s can be combined into a single\n+aggregate log by running the `combine_logs.py` script. The output can be plain\n+text, colorized text or html. For example:\n+\n+```\n+combine_logs.py -c <test data directory> | less -r\n+```\n+\n+will pipe the colorized logs from the test into less.\n+\n+Use --tracerpc to trace out all the RPC calls and responses to the console. For\n+some tests (eg any that use `submitblock` to submit a full block over RPC),\n+this can result in a lot of screen output.\n+\n+By default, the test data directory will be deleted after a successful run.\n+Use `--nocleanup` to leave the test data directory intact. The test data\n+directory is never deleted after a failed test.\n+\n+##### Attaching a debugger\n+\n+A python debugger can be attached to tests at any point. Just add the line:\n+\n+```py\n+import pdb; pdb.set_trace()",

However, if there is another bitcoind\n+process running on the system (perhaps from a previous test which hasn't successfully\n+killed all its bitcoind nodes), then there may be a port conflict which will\n+cause the test to fail.

The output can be plain\n+text, colorized text or html. For example:\n+\n+```\n+combine_logs.py -c <test data directory> | less -r\n+```\n+\n+will pipe the colorized logs from the test into less.\n+\n+Use --tracerpc to trace out all the RPC calls and responses to the console. For\n+some tests (eg any that use `submitblock` to submit a full block over RPC),\n+this can result in a lot of screen output.\n+\n+By default, the test data directory will be deleted after a successful run.\n+Use `--nocleanup` to leave the test data directory intact. The test data\n+directory is never deleted after a failed test.\n+\n+##### Attaching a debugger\n+\n+A python debugger can be attached to tests at any point.

However, if there is another bitcoind\n+process running on the system (perhaps from a previous test which hasn't successfully\n+killed all its bitcoind nodes), then there may be a port conflict which will\n+cause the test to fail. It is recommended that you run the tests on a system\n+where no other bitcoind processes are running.\n+\n+On linux, the test_framework will warn if there is another\n+bitcoind process running when the tests are started.\n+\n+If there are zombie bitcoind processes after test failure, you can kill them by running:\n+\n+```bash\n+killall bitcoind\n ```\n \n-If you set the environment variable `PYTHON_DEBUG=1` you will get some debug\n-output (example: `PYTHON_DEBUG=1 test/functional/test_runner.py wallet`).\n+or\n \n-A 200-block -regtest blockchain and wallets for four nodes\n-is created the first time a regression test is run and\n-is stored in the cache/ directory.

This speeds up\n+test startup times since new blockchains don't need to be generated for\n+each test. However, the cache may get into a bad state, in which case\n+tests will fail. If this happens, remove the cache directory (and make\n+sure bitcoind processes are stopped as above):\n \n ```bash\n rm -rf cache\n killall bitcoind\n ```\n \n-Util tests\n-----------\n+##### Test logging\n+\n+The tests contain logging at different levels (debug, info, warning, etc). By\n+default:\n+\n+- when run through the test_runner harness, *all* logs are written to\n+  `test_framework.log` and no logs are output to the console.\n+- when run directly, *all* logs are written to `test_framework.log` and INFO\n+  level and above are output to the console.\n+- when run on Travis, no logs are output to the console. However, if a test\n+  fails, the `test_framework.log` and bitcoind `debug.log`s will all be dumped\n+  to the console to help troubleshooting.\n+\n+To change the level of logs output to the console, use the `-l` command line\n+argument.\n+\n+`test_framework.log` and bitcoind `debug.log`s can be combined into a single\n+aggregate log by running the `combine_logs.py` script. The output can be plain\n+text, colorized text or html. For example:\n+\n+```\n+combine_logs.py -c <test data directory> | less -r\n+```\n+\n+will pipe the colorized logs from the test into less.\n+\n+Use --tracerpc to trace out all the RPC calls and responses to the console. For\n+some tests (eg any that use `submitblock` to submit a full block over RPC),\n+this can result in a lot of screen output.\n+\n+By default, the test data directory will be deleted after a successful run.\n+Use `--nocleanup` to leave the test data directory intact. The test data\n+directory is never deleted after a failed test.\n+\n+##### Attaching a debugger\n+\n+A python debugger can be attached to tests at any point. Just add the line:\n+\n+```py\n+import pdb; pdb.set_trace()",
