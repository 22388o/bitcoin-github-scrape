jnewbery,2017-06-18T15:39:20Z,"Indeed. I'd also like to see an assert within `wait_until()`. I've previously tried adding an assert into that function and it causes several tests to fail.\n\nFixing those cases where `wait_until()` isn't actually returning True is a job for another PR. When that happens, a scripted diff to `s/assert wait_until/wait_until/` should be run, which will update this example test script.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10612#discussion_r122593943,122593943,test/functional/example_test.py
jnewbery,2017-06-18T15:41:59Z,"Potentially, yes. `combine_logs.py` was written to be portable (and even usable on machines where test_framework is not installed).\n\nAgain, I think this is a job for another PR.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10612#discussion_r122594010,122594010,test/README.md

sdaftuar,2017-06-22T18:11:06Z,"I think it'd be nice to mention the locking issues with reaching into a `NodeConnCB` from the main thread.
