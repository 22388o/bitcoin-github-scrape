  "body": "This slightly modifies the behavior of IsTrusted to recursively check the parents of a transaction. Otherwise, it's possible that a parent is not IsTrusted but a child is. If a parent is not trusted, then a child should not be either.\r\n\r\nThis recursive scan can be a little expensive, so ~it might be beneficial to have a way of caching IsTrusted state, but this is a little complex because various conditions can change between calls to IsTrusted (e.g., re-org).~ I added a cache which works per call/across calls, but does not store the results semi-permanently. Which reduces DoS risk of this change. There is no risk of untrusted parents causing a resource exploitation, as we immediately return once that is detected.\r\n\r\nThis is a change that came up as a bug-fix esque change while working on OP_SECURETHEBAG. You can see the branch where this change is important here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/compare/master...JeremyRubin:stb-with-rpc?expand=1. Essentially, without this change, we can be tricked into accepting an OP_SECURETHEBAG output because we don't properly check the parents. As this was a change which, on its own, was not dependent on OP_SECURETHEBAG, I broke it out as I felt the change stands on its own by fixing a long standing wallet bug.\r\n\r\nThe test wallet_balance.py has been corrected to meet the new behavior. The below comment, reproduced, explains what the issue is and the edge cases that can arise before this change.\r\n\r\n        # Before `test_balance()`, we have had two nodes with a balance of 50\r\n        # each and then we:\r\n        #\r\n        # 1) Sent 40 from node A to node B with fee 0.01\r\n        # 2) Sent 60 from node B to node A with fee 0.01\r\n        #\r\n        # Then we check the balances:\r\n        #\r\n        # 1) As is\r\n        # 2) With transaction 2 from above with 2x the fee\r\n        #\r\n        # Prior to #16766, in this situation, the node would immediately report\r\n        # a balance of 30 on node B as unconfirmed and trusted.\r\n        #\r\n        # After #16766, we show that balance as unconfirmed.\r\n        #\r\n        # The balance is indeed \"trusted\" and \"confirmed\" insofar as removing\r\n        # the mempool transactions would return at least that much money. But\r\n        # the algorithm after #16766 marks it as unconfirmed because the 'taint'\r\n        # tracking of transaction trust for summing balances doesn't consider\r\n        # which inputs belong to a user. In this case, the change output in\r\n        # question could be \"destroyed\" by replace the 1st transaction above.\r\n        #\r\n        # The post #16766 behavior is correct; we shouldn't be treating those\r\n        # funds as confirmed. If you want to rely on that specific UTXO existing\r\n        # which has given you that balance, you cannot, as a third party\r\n        # spending the other input would destroy that unconfirmed.\r\n        #\r\n        # For example, if the test transactions were:\r\n        #\r\n        # 1) Sent 40 from node A to node B with fee 0.01\r\n        # 2) Sent 10 from node B to node A with fee 0.01\r\n        #\r\n        # Then our node would report a confirmed balance of 40 + 50 - 10 = 80\r\n        # BTC, which is more than would be available if transaction 1 were\r\n        # replaced.\r\n\r\nThe release notes have been updated to note the new behavior.",
