laanwj,2016-01-28T11:42:09Z,"> (I'm not aware of plans to change [distinct between multiple]) RBF options.\n\nThere are no such plans, but @luke-jr wants to support other kinds of RBF in his own fork.\nNo strong opinion either for or against this.

MarcoFalke,2016-01-28T12:08:38Z,How would this work? The release notes mention `-permitrbf` and you removed that code entirely.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7431#issuecomment-176147483,176147483,
jonasschnelli,2016-01-28T12:18:00Z,"@MarcoFalke: Right. The release notes need an update – IF – we would merge this.\nIIUTC: The forward compatibility means, that of someone throws in string arg like `-replacebyfee=foo,bar,opt-in` it would result in enabling opt-in-RBF.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7431#issuecomment-176151802,176151802,

Also adding it to the blacklist may be worth to consider as the option is already in use and promoted/posted.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7431#issuecomment-176189377,176189377,
