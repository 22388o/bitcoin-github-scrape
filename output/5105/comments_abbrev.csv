laanwj,2014-10-20T07:54:39Z,"Rename is a clear improvement, ACK.\n\nAside: I've always wondered if the intermediate abstract/virtual class makes sense at all. In principle anything could just subscribe/unsubscribe from the signals they care about, instead of having to inherit a class and add methods with specific names (potentially resulting in collisions).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5105#issuecomment-59698348,59698348,
