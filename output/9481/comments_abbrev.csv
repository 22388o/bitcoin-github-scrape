morcos,2017-01-06T14:04:09Z,"Concept ACK\n\nI think there are a few other things we could potentially do:\n- Clarify via release notes that fallbackfee can be set on the command line and should be when starting a new node or catching up from a long time ago.\n- Change the default fallbackfee every release (yeah i know... no one likes this, including me)\n- Prevent transactions from going out using fee estimation if we wo",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9481#issuecomment-270908936,270908936,

MarcoFalke,2017-01-06T10:50:01Z,validating the whole chain is not enough. You also need the mempool at all times of validation.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9481#discussion_r94929703,94929703,src/qt/forms/sendcoinsdialog.ui
MarcoFalke,2017-01-06T10:50:40Z,The warning is one sided. Using the fallbackfee might also *overpay*,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9481#discussion_r94929799,94929799,src/qt/forms/sendcoinsdialog.ui
MarcoFalke,2017-01-06T10:51:52Z,Maybe just mention that the fallbackfee is hardcoded and the fee should be selected manually.
