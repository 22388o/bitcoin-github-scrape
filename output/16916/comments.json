    "body": "Thanks @BlockMechanic. I see some commits here that are not really related to Qt or Android so you should clean that up first. Also bumping the Qt version should probably be a separate PR and even then quite controversial. What I find useful from this PR is the 32-bit support which I don't personally care for (don't see the point going forward) but maybe best to work that in on top of [#16110](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16110).",

    "body": "Rebasing this on #16110 would be nice; that way I can test if that PR actually works on a device rather than just compiles.\r\n\r\nEventually the QT upgrade should be its own PR, but just keep it in here for now; pending more conceptual discussion. We occasionally open an issue to bump the QT version in depends (relevant for this), as well as the minimum supported QT version (not really relevant). See also discussion about macOS and QT 5.12 in #16392.\r\n\r\nOnce you figured out how to build an APK, the next important question, brought up in #16883 is whether this APK can built with Gitian, in particular: if there are any non-deterministic build steps.",
