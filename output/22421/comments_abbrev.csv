MarcoFalke,2021-07-10 05:28:41,"nit: Maybe turn this into a switch-case to get compiler output when v2 is added, but this isn't updated?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22421#discussion_r667293318,667293318,src/script/sign.cpp
MarcoFalke,2021-07-15 08:51:35,@sipa Are you still working on this? Happy to take over if not.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22421#discussion_r670266458,670266458,src/script/sign.cpp
achow101,2021-07-16 00:15:59,This would return true for Taproot scripts that are in the P2SH even though such scripts cannot be spent. Do we want to do that?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22421#discussion_r670882347,670882347,src/script/sign.cpp
sipa,2021-07-16 00:19:46,"Yes, I noticed that, but I think my answer is yes. It also used to return true for unknown witness versions, so no reason to exclude v1 p2sh. It's still segwit; just not taproot.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22421#discussion_r670883548,670883548,src/script/sign.cpp
