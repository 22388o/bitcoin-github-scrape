The consensus rule only enforces that that `coinbase_output <= block_reward + fees`. \r\nYou are right that the output could have included the fees in it too, but it is unnecessary for this test. Adding the additional fees would (slightly)complicate the code, and testing fee reward calculation is not the subject of this particular test.",
