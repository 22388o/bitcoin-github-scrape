jamesob,2018-07-18T18:39:39Z,Doesn't seem like this subclass is necessary. Any reason you can't just use P2PInterface on line 23 below?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13670#discussion_r203487092,203487092,test/functional/p2p_invalid_getdata.py

MarcoFalke,2018-08-11T01:29:48Z,"I think an earlier version of the code would crash when receiving such an inv. But yeah, somewhat agree that a new test file with all the overhead is a bit too much for testing so little",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13670#discussion_r209412592,209412592,test/functional/p2p_invalid_getdata.py
