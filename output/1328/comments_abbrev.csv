laanwj,2012-05-17T10:59:13Z,"Probably depends on the compiler version. Newer compilers will reject the use of undefined functions and types in parametrized templates. Older compilers will only check at instantiation time, so will let this pass.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1328#issuecomment-5761923,5761923,
ahf,2012-05-17T11:20:43Z,"Where exactly is the circular dependency between those headers? `sync.h` includes `util.h` only on OS X if this patch is applied, but `util.h` only includes `netbase.h` which does not include `sync.h`.\n\nHow would you prefer this to be solved? A forward declaration or moving the `Sleep()` function around?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1328#issuecomment-5762173,5762173,
