These class of bugs are common and dangerous. Static analysis is very important for this class of project. I am referring to specifially this PR - NULL -> nillptr. I would think it's one of the less important checks condering it's affects are rare. And even easier to catch in a review so chances are low.

    "body": "[cppcheck](http://cppcheck.sourceforge.net/)'s goal is to actually improve security of software by first and foremost identifying undefined behavior.\r\n\r\nTo quote:\r\n\r\n> Cppcheck is a static analysis tool for C/C++ code. It provides unique code analysis to detect bugs and focuses on detecting undefined behaviour and dangerous coding constructs. The goal is to detect only real errors in the code (i.e. have very few false positives).\r\n>\r\n>[...]\r\n>\r\n>CVEs that was found using Cppcheck:\r\n> - CVE-2017-1000249 : file : stack based buffer overflow<br>This was found by Thomas Jarosch using Cppcheck. The cause is a mistake in a condition.\r\n> - CVE-2013-6462 : 23 year old stack overflow in X.org that was found with Cppcheck.\r\n> CVE-2012-1147 : readfilemap.c in expat before 2.1.0 allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (file descriptor consumption) via a large number of crafted XML files..\r\n> \r\n> These CVEs are shown when you google \"cppcheck CVE\". Feel free to compare the search results with other static analysis tools.\r\n> \r\n> Security experts recommend that static analysis is used. And using several tools is the best approach from a security perspective.\r\n\r\nOther tools like `clang-tidy` can cleary identify issues like `NULL` vs `nullptr` (which I do not consider just a stylistic issue due to type safety), but in a more straight forward way then a bunch of possibly fragile handcrafted scripts. They can be configured just like the existing `shellscript` checker to only check for certain conditions.",

There are currently ~550 open issues on this project. Contributor and reviewer time spent on getting that number down would be more valuable than yet more refactor PRs.\r\n\r\nCode quality is obviously important. At the same time there's a general feeling that the continual code churn and PR traffic that results from all these refactor PRs is slowing down the project and deflecting reviewer/maintainer focus from more important issues.",
