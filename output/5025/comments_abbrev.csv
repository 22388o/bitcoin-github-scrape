theuni,2014-10-01T21:02:10Z,@sipa might be worth pulling this into your headers-first branch and letting it fail so we can see if it is enough to be useful.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5025#issuecomment-57537898,57537898,
TheBlueMatt,2014-10-01T22:21:01Z,Why not just cat instead of tail? Maybe the error was right at the beginning and it kept running.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5025#issuecomment-57550706,57550706,
theuni,2014-10-01T22:34:10Z,See description. Travis has a limit for how big the output can be. Here's what the log looks like after a successful run:\n\n``` bash\ncory@cory-i7:~/dev/bitcoin(travis-print-log)$ wc -l .bitcoin/regtest/debug.log\n26015 .bitcoin/regtest/debug.log\ncory@cory-i7:~/dev/bitcoin(travis-print-log)$ du -h .bitcoin/regtest/debug.log \n1.7M    .bitcoin/regtest/debug.log\n```\n\nThings would get ugly if we,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5025#issuecomment-57552627,57552627,

laanwj,2014-10-02T06:33:35Z,"> Well, we should just include the full debug.log with the copy over to bitcoincore.org or so.\n\nOnce Travis grows support for producing multiple build results and securely uploading them, that would be the idea.
