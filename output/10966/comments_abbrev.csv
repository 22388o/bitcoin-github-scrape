promag,2017-08-02T19:17:37Z,Makes sense since there are no order guarantees of notification commands. Should that be fixed or for now sort both arrays?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10966#issuecomment-319770936,319770936,
jnewbery,2017-08-02T19:35:33Z,"> there are no order guarantees of notification commands. Should that be fixed or for now sort both arrays?\n\nI think it's fine not to change to sort the arrays in this test (as long as you add a comment to say that notifications are not guaranteed to be in order).\n\nFeel free to open a separate pull request if you think notifications should be in order.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10966#issuecomment-319775389,319775389,
promag,2017-08-02T21:26:20Z,"@jnewbery if the out-of-order is not handled in the test, this will cause unrelated travis failures. If at the moment the order is not guaranteed, then the test must handle that IMO. In the future, if the order is guaranteed, then the test is adjusted.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10966#issuecomment-319803596,319803596,

jnewbery,2017-08-02T21:42:35Z,I've been thinking: Does it make sense to combine this and blocknotify with the existing `forknotify.py` test?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10966#issuecomment-319807402,319807402,
