These sort of things belong in your global .gitignore and not in every project. see https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files#create-a-global-gitignore\n\nIf anything the project level .gitignore should be cleaned up, not added to, so it only contains ignores for things that are specific to the project (like compiled objects and all the noise compiler creates etc). IDE and OS exclusions belong in a user's own global ignore.\n",
