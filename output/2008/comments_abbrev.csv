laanwj,2012-11-14T06:29:25Z,"Indeed, you can define flags using an enum, but you can't use the enum as parameter when you want to be able to specify multiple flags as it's no longer an enumeration. I believe Qt has a 'typesafe flags' type but that doesn't help us here :) I do think defining the flag values using an enum has a nicer syntax than a list of const XXX.\n\nAnd I agree with @jgarzik that it's better to have anything",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2008#issuecomment-10356561,10356561,

We should then change to `unsigned int` there, too, right?\n\n@luke-jr: GCC warns about OR 2 enum flags, when the function parameter is expected to be an enum ;), tried it.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2008#issuecomment-10357651,10357651,
