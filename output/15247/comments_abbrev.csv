jnewbery,2019-01-25T17:10:08Z,what is `d` for here? Would changing it to `tx_out` here make it clearer?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15247#discussion_r251061187,251061187,test/functional/wallet_abandonconflict.py
MarcoFalke,2019-01-25T18:43:39Z,`d` is short for `details`,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15247#discussion_r251092810,251092810,test/functional/wallet_abandonconflict.py

MarcoFalke,2019-01-25T19:26:28Z,"It is specific to the rpc, see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/f0c9e1c22b8a043983f3ba90ad910b67cf981e36/src/wallet/rpcwallet.cpp#L1684, so I am sticking to that naming scheme. I don't mind if someone improves the documentation there.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15247#discussion_r251107225,251107225,test/functional/wallet_abandonconflict.py
jnewbery,2019-01-25T20:06:16Z,"The name `details` can't be changed in the RPC since it's part of the API. I'm just suggesting you could use a more variable name which is more descriptive for people reading the test.\n\nACK either way.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15247#discussion_r251119491,251119491,test/functional/wallet_abandonconflict.py
