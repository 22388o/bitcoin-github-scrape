practicalswift,2018-11-05T22:56:56Z,"@ryanofsky I think the `U` suffix suggestion was based on a misunderstanding regarding the types of C++ integer literals.\n\nMore specifically that the integer literal of `4294967295` can be assumed to have the same type as the integer literal `0xffffffff`.\n\nThat assumption is false :-)\n\nProof:\n\n```\n[cling]$ #include <typeindex>\n[cling]$ #include <typeinfo>\n[cling]$ std::type_i",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14636#issuecomment-436067152,436067152,
ryanofsky,2018-11-05T23:15:18Z,"The u suffix isn't needed, but it's nice because it makes it more obvious that compiler will choose an unsigned type. (According to the ""type of the literal"" table in https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/integer_literal, the compiler without the u would choose smallest signed or unsigned type that holds the value.)",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14636#issuecomment-436071705,436071705,
