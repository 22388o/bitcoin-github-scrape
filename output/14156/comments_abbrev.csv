MarcoFalke,2018-09-06T15:37:38Z,"For most cases the performance should not matter (e.g. unit tests or benches where the conversion is not in a hot path. Also, for the rpc interface or tx-tools, where the overhead of communication dwarfs the speedup of skipping the conversion). For other cases, we might want to accept either a mutable or immuatable tx. See e.g.  #13359 or #13309",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14156#issuecomment-419141043,419141043,
lucash-dev,2018-09-06T15:48:16Z,@MarcoFalke I agree with you that in most cases it won't make a difference. But I think having it implicit makes it harder to reason about the cases when it's important.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14156#issuecomment-419144837,419144837,
MarcoFalke,2018-09-06T15:53:19Z,"I think the only case where it could potentially matter is `src/wallet/wallet.cpp`?\n\nBut agree that it makes sense to mark it explicit, so that the other cases are easily visible. Though, might still want to submit the other prs first that do the cleanup you had planned afterward. This way we avoid having to touch the lines twice.\n\nIf you wanted to have this merged first, at the very least",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14156#issuecomment-419146537,419146537,
