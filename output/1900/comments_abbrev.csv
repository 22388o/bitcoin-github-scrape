laanwj,2012-10-02T12:06:50Z,"OK to the changes, except the one that requires an ""extern"" global variable\nin the header file.\n\nThe idea is to keep the communication with the bitcoin core limited to the\n*model.cpp implementation files.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1900#issuecomment-9068559,9068559,

laanwj,2012-10-02T12:35:39Z,"It's violated in a few places, for example signmessage.cpp directly uses\ncore calls and data structures. That's very low-priority, and it's not\nworth adding too much code for, but when I can I try to prevent it.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1900#issuecomment-9069263,9069263,
Diapolo,2012-10-02T16:52:28Z,"@laanwj Thanks for explaining the idea to limit core access to *model.cpp, but I have to ask what makes the difference between having them in a .cpp or a .h only in the end?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1900#issuecomment-9077983,9077983,

laanwj,2012-10-07T07:09:02Z,"I'm neutral on this. This change is balancing on the ugly edges of C++, on one side this cuts down on the amount of boilerplate lines to compensate for the lack of properties, on the other hand this moves implementation details to the interface description which is also undesirable (but in many cases unavoidable, at least if you want to make full use of the language with templates and such).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1900#issuecomment-9205784,9205784,
sipa,2012-10-07T12:29:41Z,"@laanwj Ok, good to know. There has been a general trend towards moving code to .cpp files, but I wasn't sure to what extent we want to pursue this.
