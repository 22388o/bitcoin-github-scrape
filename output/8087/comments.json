I believe you are underestimating how disruptive this PR would be to my previous (but still not reviewed or merged) work in this subject. Let's please take little steps trying to find common ground. I never created the promised \"libconsensus plan\" document with pictures, but people really really interested have always had the chance to look at my longest branches (thus I assumed nobody was really as interested as they claimed...). Please, feel free to comment on any of my multiple \"consensus\" closed PRs.\n",
