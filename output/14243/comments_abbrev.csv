laanwj,2018-09-19T12:20:56Z,"A TCP socket (""network socket"") is also a socket. To be precise, the ""Tor control protocol"" runs over a socket, which can be of different types. On Windows this only supports network sockets, on UNIX it can use a local socket.\n\nTo be honest, I'd prefer to add UNIX socket support instead, if you think that results in confusing. I don't think changing this word is worth it.\n\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14243#issuecomment-422781288,422781288,
emilrus,2018-09-19T14:14:02Z,"@laanwj agree on the use of word socket however this is a different scenario\nIt is the control protocol of tor that has an API, the control socket is just a socket through which the control protocol is used.\nIt is akin to saying RPC API instead of Bitcoin API because you're using the API through RPC.\n\nIt is just a nit and I don't care either way but I think it should be changed for rigorou",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14243#issuecomment-422820167,422820167,
