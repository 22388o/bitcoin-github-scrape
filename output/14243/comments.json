    "body": "@laanwj agree on the use of word socket however this is a different scenario\r\nIt is the control protocol of tor that has an API, the control socket is just a socket through which the control protocol is used.\r\nIt is akin to saying RPC API instead of Bitcoin API because you're using the API through RPC.\r\n\r\nIt is just a nit and I don't care either way but I think it should be changed for rigorousness.  \r\nI also subscribe to having unix socket support added to Bitcoin's tor control given that Debian comes with it by default and has tcp sockets disabled.",
