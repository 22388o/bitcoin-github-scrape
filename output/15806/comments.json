    "body": "To be clear: it was not my intent to remove this filtering completely, especially not in an immediate follow-up PR. \r\n\r\nAs it stands now there are valid reasons to leave out some nodes. The long-term goal should be to harden the code and protocol against spy nodes, but we're not there yet.\r\n\r\nMy principle is that I just don't want to maintain a blacklist as part of the bitcoin core project. So if you want to make this change, please add an option to pass in an external list.\r\n",
