laanwj,2016-01-16T09:20:21Z,"Concept ACK. \n\nNot that you moved it, but for completeness' sake: please leave rpcwallet.cpp in src/wallet. e.g. it is the RPC interface to the wallet. This, imo, logically belongs to the wallet: if there was a different wallet it could have a different RPC interface.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7348#issuecomment-172176263,172176263,
