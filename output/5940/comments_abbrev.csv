jonasschnelli,2015-03-23T19:13:10Z,"utACK.\n\nTwo points:\n\n1)\nWould it make sense to somehow remove this command when running in a non test/dev. mode? I don't have a good idea here (detect --enable-debug, only during `--regtest` & `--testnet` seems not to be the best approach).\n\n2) \nHow about returning a array of rebroadcasted wtx ids instead of a single count int?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5940#issuecomment-85154012,85154012,

luke-jr,2015-03-23T22:14:56Z,"This test appears that it would fail to catch an error, if mempool syncing is ever merged. It would be better if the nodes were all restarted concurrently to clear their mempools, but failing that perhaps just a comment on this limitation in the test code would be good to have.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5940#issuecomment-85227438,85227438,
