Maybe document that the function needs to be called with the lock held.\n\nRelying on the return value from CWallet::AddToWalletIfInvolvingMe should be safe as fUpdate is true. It will always return true unless the transaction is not in the wallet and not involving me, or a write problem happened in wtx.WriteToDisk().\n\nA",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3849#issuecomment-37539435,37539435,
