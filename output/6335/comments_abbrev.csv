jtimon,2015-06-26T07:06:19Z,@theuni re additional declaration. It was to not leave the comment alone until it is replaced with the CStandardPolicy method that will replace it in https://github.com/jtimon/bitcoin/commit/3fdcfedadafebb11f5ee01f10ef2c0f0f98c74d5#diff-d22bc3e058f8982972e2eb381a1df668L35 but I'm happy to remove that line if it doesn't make sense to anyone else. For me having the comment ready there is enough.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6335#issuecomment-115554126,115554126,
