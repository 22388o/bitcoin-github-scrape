Diapolo,2012-09-22T07:58:06Z,"This change is IMO a deeper one, as current release are still build with Qt 4.7.x. I would also love to see us switch to a newer version, but at least I (using Windows) can currently not work with 4.8.3 because of a qmake bug they introduced. 4.8.2 works pretty good and is used by the pull tester afaik, so 4.8.2 seems to be rather matured!\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1852#discussion_r1667457,1667457,doc/release-process.txt
