Should there be an InitWarning when the user tries to setzapwallettxes?\n\nPerhaps, although this is an unlikely scenario since:\n- persistmempool is a new in 0.15, so no-one can be using it yet\n- the default value for persistmempool is true, so there's no reason to set it in bitcoin.conf\n\nI'm inclined not to add the warning, but let m",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10330#issuecomment-311369451,311369451,
