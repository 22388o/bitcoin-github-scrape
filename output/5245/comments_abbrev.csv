laanwj,2014-11-10T19:41:43Z,"@jonasschnelli I suggested to use the constructor parameter, it's fine. Wallet or not is not an option (like the others), so doesn't belong on the options model either.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5245#issuecomment-62441746,62441746,

jonasschnelli,2014-11-10T19:53:31Z,"Okay, i see. Options has nothing to do with startup/config args. Right.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5245#issuecomment-62443773,62443773,
laanwj,2014-11-11T08:04:22Z,"@jonasschnelli Well it's a grey area in this case. It's sort of an option, but one that switches the entire identity of the program. For OptionsDialog it's a matter of 'what version of the UI to show', and I think it's more transparent to just pass a flag.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5245#issuecomment-62514201,62514201,

Diapolo,2014-11-10T13:42:04Z,This has the wrong indentation.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5245#discussion_r20081743,20081743,src/qt/optionsdialog.cpp
jonasschnelli,2014-11-10T14:52:57Z,Is it worth to have a initializer parameter (enableWallet) for this?\nWould it not be possible to wrap the bool through the OptionsModel instance?\nMy idea would be to do...\n   ui->tabWidget->removeTab(...)\n... when setting the optionsModel and after checking thought the optionsModel if the wallet is enabled.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5245#discussion_r20085543,20085543,src/qt/bitcoingui.cpp
