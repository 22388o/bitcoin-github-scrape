laanwj,2017-05-24T10:19:42Z,"Concept ACK. The six-byte hash is a good idea; I thought of replacing it with simply the `fd6b:88c0:8724::<seqnr>` of the DNS seed, but it needs to be compatible over time and those seeds could be added and removed so this solution is better.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10446#issuecomment-303681810,303681810,
