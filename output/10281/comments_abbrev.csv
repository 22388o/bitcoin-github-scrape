kallewoof,2017-04-26T06:42:44Z,"This is not the case right now. At the moment, 0 maps to false and !0 maps to true. See e.g. `getrawtransaction`'s `verbose` argument handling.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10281#discussion_r113375884,113375884,doc/developer-notes.md
kallewoof,2017-04-26T06:43:44Z,Thanks for this! I vaguely presumed this was the case but never found anything explicitly stating it.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10281#discussion_r113376005,113376005,doc/developer-notes.md

laanwj,2017-04-26T07:20:16Z,"Or not. What I meant here is:\n```\nfalse=0\ntrue=1\n```\nE.g, the C++ mapping, not the bash mapping. As far as I know, we follow that everywhere?\nIf this wording is confusing, can you suggest another way.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10281#discussion_r113380903,113380903,doc/developer-notes.md
kallewoof,2017-04-26T07:40:17Z,"I read it as ""interpret 0 as false and 1 as true, and anything else is [??]"".\n\nI.e. if a user passes 2 or -1 to the new RPC command which maps as you said, how will it treat values beyond [0, 1]?\n\nAm I misunderstanding?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10281#discussion_r113384347,113384347,doc/developer-notes.md
laanwj,2017-04-26T08:07:07Z,"I don't say anything about values besides 0 and 1 on purpose. Those may either map to 1, or to something else entirely (referring to ""when bool has switched to multi-value""), or cause a failure.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10281#discussion_r113389070,113389070,doc/developer-notes.md
kallewoof,2017-04-26T08:26:34Z,"Ohh I was reading this backwards. You're talking about when a bool becomes an int, and I about when an int is interpreted as a bool. I'll think on wording to make this obvious.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10281#discussion_r113392662,113392662,doc/developer-notes.md
kallewoof,2017-05-01T07:41:48Z,"Re-reading this, I think I was simply not reading it properly. I think it looks fine as is.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10281#discussion_r114106150,114106150,doc/developer-notes.md
