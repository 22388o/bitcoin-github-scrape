sipa,2018-09-06T21:38:47Z,I think this is not a similarity but a difference: an address does not (generally) convey information on how to spend it; a descriptor does (unless `raw` or `addr` are used).,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14161#discussion_r215787027,215787027,doc/descriptors.md
sipa,2018-09-06T21:41:55Z,"I haven't really thought of descriptors as ""filters"" that match certain sPK, more as compact descriptions for specifically instantiated scripts.\n\nPerhaps it makes sense to describe it this way (especially in the context of `scantxoutset`), but perhaps it is also confusing. It may make people wonder why a range needs to be explicitly specified, or why an `addr(1...)` can't match a P2PK output.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14161#discussion_r215787756,215787756,doc/descriptors.md

ryanofsky,2018-09-10T20:54:30Z,"Well, these edits are just suggestions. I'm happy to revert anything or change it however you'd like.\n\nBut I guess I don't really get the point about BIP32 ranges and addr() with P2PK, because it seems like you have to document the behavior either way. And in theory if we wanted to match P2PK keys & hashes, it wouldn't actually complicate the current implementation very much.\n\nI like sayin",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14161#discussion_r216469388,216469388,doc/descriptors.md
ryanofsky,2018-09-10T21:09:25Z,"Yeah, this sentence would probably be clearer dropping ""that a given wallet knows how to spend"" from the end. The difference you are describing is basically difference #1 in the list below.\n\nBut I think it might be a good idea to drop this section entirely. Basically I was trying to describe the properties of descriptors by contrasting them with addresses. But I think it might be better to hav",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14161#discussion_r216473938,216473938,doc/descriptors.md
sipa,2018-10-12T22:58:43Z,"Ah, perhaps this isn't clear from the current implementation yet.\n\nOne of the original goals was to have an explicit representation for the actual set of scriptPubKeys that match the wallet. This would permit much faster rescans, as it avoids the need to feed every `scriptPubKey` seen in the chain through the `IsMine` machinery, and instead just test for inclusion in a set. Alternatively, it p",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14161#discussion_r224934254,224934254,doc/descriptors.md
sipa,2018-10-12T22:59:58Z,I suspect this will clear itself up when more uses for descriptors appear.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14161#discussion_r224934391,224934391,doc/descriptors.md
ryanofsky,2018-10-17T16:20:48Z,"Replaced ""matches"" with a ""describes"" in a followup commit.\n\nAfter hearing about plans for the wallet, I think I now agree ""matches scriptingPubKeys"" is too narrow, since we're not only going to use descriptors as a way of matching tx outputs, but also as a way of generating outputs and addresses (by replacing keypools in the wallet, and serving as a bridge between wallet and the ""policy langu",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14161#discussion_r226002235,226002235,doc/descriptors.md
