laanwj,2018-03-27T19:49:46Z,"Interesting, good catch.\nThough personally I think it makes sense to describe this possible field if it is in BIP22. Both for consistency with our documentation and the BIP, and in case core would ever want to set this flag, you'd want client implementations to take it into account.\nOn the other hand that's probably very unlikely. Needs more discussion.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12764#issuecomment-376652194,376652194,
