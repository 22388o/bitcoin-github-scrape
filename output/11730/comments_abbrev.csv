TheBlueMatt,2017-11-19T23:05:33Z,"Strong NACK. The use-cases for removing HD seed (mostly desire to have backups not permanently compromise funds) are all but fully addressed by #11085. As for removing SegWit, I'm not fully convinced it's the right direction, but if we do I think making it an external tool is the way to go - supporting downgrading wallets adds a ton of complexity that I don't think is realistically maintainable.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11730#issuecomment-345557893,345557893,
luke-jr,2017-11-19T23:06:08Z,"I don't think it really makes sense to try to support downgrades. In most cases, it would simply be impossible. Better to just restore `-usehd=0` (#11582).\n\nAs for Segwit changes, my understanding is that support for non-Segwit wallets will be retained.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11730#issuecomment-345557931,345557931,

If you really want to allow users to switch to non-HD key generation for some reason, just change the key generation. Start using the legacy key generation for new keys. Don't touch older keys.\n\nAll in all I'm kind o",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11730#issuecomment-345669106,345669106,
