    "body": "@gmaxwell re: transactions that would have been priority eligible in blocks now: I think it's important to attempt to distinguish transactions that were sent with the intention to be confirmed by priority.  Of course I think we will find those, I send those myself, but that doesn't mean those users won't adapt.\n\nJust to summarize some of the reasons to deprecate priority:\n- code complexity: I think the computational complexity can be kept within reason at least for the existing functionality, but the code touches a lot of different places and it makes it more difficult to do perhaps more important work in those areas.\n- long term viability: If it's not incentive compatible, how long should we go about trying to put effort into supporting it.\n- it's currently broken: With mempool limiting not respecting priority its almost a useless concept anyway.  \n- we're not foreclosing on the possibility of some future notion of coin age: Perhaps we can regain most of the lost benefits of the existing priority metric with something like sipa's proposed coin age based fee delta.  Or even just a cleaner and more general way to implement a different metric that doesn't require so much core maintenance.\n",

    "body": "OK, as only me and @luke-jr ACKed, there is a clear dev-consensus that priority is to be removed from Bitcoin Core. I accept it myself. Do not agree with it, but accept it ;-) This will make the code lot simpler but we are loosing interesting aspect/motivation for some people. In fact this decision has economic effect (small though) on some bitcoin users.\n\nThe next time we plan to do something similar, we should announce the plan to do so first (no code changes) and then do it in some of the next releases. This was done correctly (IMO) in case of \"accounts\". We see a lot of DEPRECATED in the helptexts etc. Lets learn from it.\n",

This transaction would have become eligible for relaying and mining under the default priority policy in 0.11, after 21 additional hours (total 33 hours). Without priority, it would never be mined, leaving no recourse for the participants until the sender upgraded to a RBF-capable wallet (which currently do not exist) and decided to make use of that feature.\n",

I looked at 6 weeks of data starting Oct 1st and only at blocks which had at least 100 txs.  I then assumed that the last 10 txs in each of those blocks were fee based txs.  And the lowest fee of those 10 txs was the necessary fee to be included in the block.  So I looked for each block at how many txs were in it that had a fee less than what would have been necessary to be included in at least 2 out of the next 10 blocks, and I assumed those were the txs that benefited by priority.   This amounted to 56K out of 6.7M txs or 0.83%.\n",
