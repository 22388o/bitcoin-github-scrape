    "body": "I'm not sure how I feel about this PR.\r\n\r\nI like the idea of removing code that is untested and unreferenced, since it at risk of bitrotting, or being buggy and unnoticed.\r\n\r\nThat said, I would say that PartiallySignedTransaction::IsNull and CBlock::ToString are both (1) essentially trivial methods with a negligible possibility of error, and (2) seem like they are fulfilling some part of the interface contract of their respective classes.\r\n\r\nFor PST::IsNull, my sense is that by convention we often use value objects as \"nullable\", rather than wrap them in an Option type, if their contents are effectively all nullable. Having some sort of method to test for nullity is part of the contract required to use them in that way. (I feel more strongly about PST than PBSTInput/Output, because the latter are less likely to be useful to code external to the module, and so anybody doing fancy things with them is more likely to feel licensed to modify them to suit.)\r\n\r\nFor CBlock::ToString, it appears to be mainly intended for debugging, and I expect it's the case that many objects have ToString methods intended to fulfill this same sort of \"can be printed for debugging\" contract. I expect this method has been called with useful results in debug printfs that were never checked in, and might be again in the future. (I'm not generally working with CBlock objects, so I'm speculating, but if other nearby objects tend to have ToString methods that _are_ called that would strengthen my case.)\r\n\r\nThe BlockFilter constructor appears to be one among many, and I'm not close enough to that code to have an opinion on whether that specific variant is useful past the removal of whatever was calling it.\r\n\r\nThe comments on CBloomFilter suggest that the tweak is only useful for testing, so the reset method is unlikely to be useful outside the module's own tests, which I think makes it a good candidate for removal (again under the reasoning that anybody who's working with it is probably editing the module itself, and is likely to feel licensed to add it back if they need it.)",
