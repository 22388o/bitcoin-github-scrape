Using a lowercase 'L' looks incorrect and using just a single 'L' would cause it to be implicitly casted to 64 bits on a 32-bit compiler and explicitly defined to 64 bits on a 64-bit compiler (in most cases, because long is 64-bits on 64-bit compiler).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4254#issuecomment-44607576,44607576,
