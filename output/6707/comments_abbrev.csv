petertodd,2015-09-27T18:34:11Z,"@laanwj Done!\n\nHeh, I actually need to add that last commit to #6351, but the getblockchaininfo code was added after it and I'd rather not rebase it if I can avoid it; these two backport patches refer to commits in #6351 by commit ID and I don't want to change that. I'll fix that after #6351 is merged.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6707#issuecomment-143583019,143583019,
