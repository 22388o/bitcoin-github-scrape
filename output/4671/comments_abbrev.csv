ayeowch,2014-08-10T04:39:56Z,Addition of seed.bitnodes.io was discussed and ACK'ed in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3875. This is part of getaddr.bitnodes.io infrastructure sponsored by the Bitcoin Foundation and operated independently by myself. I believe most of the seeders are operated based on sipa's bitcoin seeder (https://github.com/sipa/bitcoin-seeder). seed.bitnodes.io is based on a separate Python implement,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4671#issuecomment-51706115,51706115,
TheBlueMatt,2014-08-10T04:48:42Z,I'm really only concerned with who the people are who are running the infrastructure. They need to be established within the community. ie before bitnodes and open-nodes they were run by developers who had been working on Bitcoin Core and had established trust that they were both technically competent and were acting for the good of Bitcoin. Though I dont propose that only developers can run a DNS,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4671#issuecomment-51706236,51706236,
TheBlueMatt,2014-08-10T04:52:44Z,"Of course I appreciate everything people are trying to do, and though running a seed is useful, its not the most critical thing for the network, especially after #4559.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4671#issuecomment-51706276,51706276,
mikehearn,2014-08-11T09:52:48Z,"I don't think Bitcoin Core needs to care overly much about this given that it has relatively little dependence on the seeds. SPV clients rely on the seeds more, but I'm personally satisfied by Addy's contributions at least. The other one (opennodes) I haven't seen and isn't in bitcoinj: I have no opinion on that one. But my gut sense is: more is better.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4671#issuecomment-51760741,51760741,

TheBlueMatt,2014-09-03T07:42:45Z,"Fair enough, removed only open-nodes.org as bitnodes is only not well established to those who weren't paying attention while they were getting established.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4671#issuecomment-54262273,54262273,
