    "body": "@midnightmagic Most Bitcoin miners are only able to do SHA256(SHA256) proofs -- someone could pose such a challenge if they wanted to and it could theoretically be used with e.g. a USB miner, but I don't know how frequent that will be. A key reason why Cuckoo Cycle was included is because it does not give users with miners an advantage (as this would give attackers an opportunity to DDoS with help of some HW miners).",
