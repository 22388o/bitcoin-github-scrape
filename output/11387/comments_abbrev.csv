theuni,2017-09-25T22:20:09Z,"@jonasschnelli Any suggestion where to stick this? The qt build fails because the global accessor has been removed. I'd hate to add the global back just for qt.\n\nIs it possible to add a QSettings value from gArgs without it ending up stored in the config file?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11387#issuecomment-332030552,332030552,
jonasschnelli,2017-09-26T21:53:00Z,"@theuni: I don't know whats the simples change. You could pass it into a GUI constant holder singleton (or pseudo global). Could be held in `guiutil.cpp/h`. Or just pass it around (to `bitcoingui.cpp`, etc., but I guess that will lead to a lot of code)",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11387#issuecomment-332347249,332347249,
benma,2017-09-27T08:47:26Z,"This seems to be the only option that changes operations on the fly. We could just not do that (`setRestartRequired(true)`).\n\nOtherwise, a clean option might be to register a callback in qt, called when non-restart settings are changed. Could hook up the `dataChanged` signal to a slot somewhere closer in qt to where the callback can be passed.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11387#issuecomment-332453488,332453488,
