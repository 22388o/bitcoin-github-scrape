laanwj,2014-12-16T09:34:14Z,Good catch.\n\nBut you add one missing check and you make changes all over the file. Can you please change this to just make the _one_ change suggested in the pull title?\n\nACK in that case.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5437#issuecomment-67133224,67133224,
Diapolo,2014-12-16T13:20:31Z,"All changes are mentioned in the commit-msg, so you also choose to remove the space after : when logging stuff. This doesn't need a discussion at all if you could just credit what I'm doing and tell me please use 2 commits for example or that you will NACK all minor stuff I try to get in recently ^^.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5437#issuecomment-67158182,67158182,

Diapolo,2014-12-07T12:34:26Z,"Just because the space after function name is not needed, I had a discussion with @laanwj about that. Uppercase just because of consistency... Deserialize is also uppercase.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5437#discussion_r21424137,21424137,src/main.cpp
