jonasschnelli,2015-09-22T12:20:38Z,"Hmm... emit the new ui signal from `DumpBanlist()` would result in multiple calling of `banTableModel->refresh();`. I'd prefer keeping this outside of the core classes (keep the call in the rpcnet.cpp methods).\nOr if you like to move it, you need to take care `RPCConsole::banSelectedNode(int bantime)`, etc. to avoid multiple calls to the same method.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6710#discussion_r40079024,40079024,src/net.cpp

jonasschnelli,2015-09-22T12:38:34Z,Wouldn't this remove the shortcut capabilities? Or where they never working in the context menu?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6710#discussion_r40080336,40080336,src/qt/rpcconsole.cpp
Diapolo,2015-09-22T12:42:15Z,"If I remember correctly we had that discussion during the creation of the pull a few weeks ago, but you didn't want to add these changes :).
