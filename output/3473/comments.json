However your proposed alternative would have even worse usability.

Some suggestions are here:\n\nhttp://eprint.iacr.org/2013/538.pdf\n\nAbility to extract a pubkey from a signature is not harmful or anything like that, but you could easily do it with a bit of custom code too, so it's not really clear this is a particularly useful RPC.

    "body": "Sorry for bringing up such an old issue - but I've run into a situation probably very similar to @tarbell here.  It would be very handy to allow verifying messages without the need to specify an address explicitly.\r\n\r\n@gmaxwell said in an [even older issue](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/1356#issuecomment-5794211) that it would be handy to allow `verifymessage` to work optionally without an explicit address.\r\n\r\nWhat is the current take on this?  I understand that having a separate `extractpubkey` RPC call is mostly a maintenance burden as stated by @laanwj above.  But what about modifying `verifymessage` in a way that allows it to return the address?  For instance, if an empty address is passed, it could return a JSON object like this:\r\n\r\n    {\r\n      \"valid\": True,\r\n      \"address\": <address>\r\n    }\r\n\r\ninstead of just a boolean.  Doing so would be very simple (just a few lines of code) and thus not have much of a maintenance burden at all.  I can do that specifically for my own application, but I wonder if it would make sense to implement this in Bitcoin Core directly (so others can make use of it as well).",
