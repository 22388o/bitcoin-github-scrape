jgarzik,2012-11-05T17:54:13Z,"I understand the motivation -- I use the internal miner every day on testnet -- but this change would defeat anyone who scripts setgenerate-on-startup, because it does not automatically re-enable mining once IBD is complete.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1989#issuecomment-10080541,10080541,
Diapolo,2012-11-05T18:39:55Z,"You are right, but to automatically enable the miner it would still be possible to use -gen or set it via the bitcoin.conf.
