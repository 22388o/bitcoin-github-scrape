People will keep writing comments in lower case non-capitalized form or whatever else that violates your proposal, and someone else will have to redo the work again for the new files.\r\n\r\nIf you want to change the code guidelines to enforce this, that may be one thing, but I don't really know if that's necessary. I'd prefer people write tests, rather than avoid writing them because of a ton of rules on how comments should be formed.",
