kallewoof,2018-10-30T10:45:56Z,"I appreciate the work, but I don't think this will help long term. People will keep writing comments in lower case non-capitalized form or whatever else that violates your proposal, and someone else will have to redo the work again for the new files.\n\nIf you want to change the code guidelines to enforce this, that may be one thing, but I don't really know if that's necessary. I'd prefer people",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14606#issuecomment-434253046,434253046,
fridokus,2018-10-30T11:00:01Z,"Yes I completely agree with you. I'm not trying to add any new rules to be enforced in the future. I want to change what's already there so that when someone new wants to write tests, if that person cares about how to write comments there is a bigger chance the person will follow the same format.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14606#issuecomment-434257074,434257074,
