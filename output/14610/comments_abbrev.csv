MarcoFalke,2018-10-30T17:56:37Z,"Our compile tooling will notice that only test files have been modified and thus `make` will only compile the test files if they have been modified, so the wording as in master sounds correct to me.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14610#issuecomment-434406142,434406142,
