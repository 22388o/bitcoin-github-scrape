MarcoFalke,2016-08-26T08:30:29Z,"If you are trying to achieve three different and orthogonal goals, I think it would make sense to split those into separate commits.\n\nOr even two pulls: One for changing the p2p behavior, the other to change debug prints.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8596#issuecomment-242666125,242666125,
gmaxwell,2016-08-29T01:33:39Z,> Increase the frequency of feeler connections to average to 1 minute instead of 2 \n\nWhy??\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8596#issuecomment-243013961,243013961,
rebroad,2016-08-29T04:25:47Z,@gmaxwell Inpatience? I also don't see why it needs to take as long as it does to purge the unused addresses. Personally I'd rather it was shorter than 60 seconds. Perhaps it could be made a command-line option...\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8596#issuecomment-243029554,243029554,
EthanHeilman,2016-08-26T19:28:36Z,Is it worth the complexity of adding another flag to ConnectNode if all the flag does is alter a log message?\nSetting this flag false does not make the connection not a feeler connection.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8596#discussion_r76474672,76474672,src/net.cpp
EthanHeilman,2016-08-26T19:30:29Z,If we are going to move the FEELER_INTERVAL to net.cpp why not move the other static const int intervals such as PING_INTERVAL or TIMEOUT_INTERVAL in net.h as well?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8596#discussion_r76474947,76474947,src/net.cpp
EthanHeilman,2016-08-26T19:31:27Z,Comment should reflect that FEELER_INTERVAL has been changed to 1 minute/60 seconds.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8596#discussion_r76475102,76475102,src/net.cpp

rebroad,2016-08-27T02:48:50Z,Ok. How should it be done?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8596#discussion_r76508836,76508836,src/net.cpp

rebroad,2016-08-27T02:52:41Z,@EthanHeilman My next commit will remove FEELER_SLEEP_WINDOW as it's redundant. I.e.  RAND(60)+RAND(1) = RAND(61)... i.e. we don't need two random numbers.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8596#discussion_r76508896,76508896,src/net.cpp

EthanHeilman,2016-08-27T16:29:21Z,"We have two sources of randomness:\n1. One FEELER_SLEEP_WINDOW is to protect against synchronization and must be random: [see discussion on feeler pull request](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8282#discussion_r73604140) and discussion in [design statement of feeler connections under risk mitigation](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8282#issue-162739771),\n2.
