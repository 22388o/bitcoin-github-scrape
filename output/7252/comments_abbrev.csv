fanquake,2015-12-25T12:42:43Z,"I'm not sure we want to start making file changes in anticipation of events 6 months ahead. This also means that any gitian builds of master between this merging and the 2016-07 are from the future? :watch: \n\nOther than being the 'real' date, what value does changing these add. I'm assuming the dates are already new enough that the binary file views isn't an issue?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7252#issuecomment-167231881,167231881,

jonasschnelli,2015-12-27T19:24:13Z,Agree with @luke-jr: can we not load the date from the tag/commit date? Time could set be set to 00:00.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7252#issuecomment-167437086,167437086,
MarcoFalke,2015-12-27T19:34:01Z,> Time could set be set to 00:00\n\nNo need to fiddle with the time. Imo it makes sense to have the exact commit (author) date corresponding to the commit which is shown in the debug window.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7252#issuecomment-167437438,167437438,
