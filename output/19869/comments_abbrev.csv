sdaftuar,2020-10-20 14:26:09,"Concept ACK improvements along these lines.  However, I'm not sure about the more complicated interval logic around the feeler connections -- it seems to me like that logic is already a bit hard to follow, so I wonder if a better approach might be to just check for invalidity in the `while (!interruptNet)` loop, and be willing to iterate in that loop many more times if `fFeeler` is set?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19869#issuecomment-712892822,712892822,
naumenkogs,2020-10-22 13:16:10,"@sdaftuar I agree with the high-level idea. Even though I don't think I'm making it significantly harder to follow, simplifying is a good idea.\n\nBut let me check, are you suggesting just to carefully use `continue` instead of `break` inside the loop?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19869#issuecomment-714486552,714486552,
