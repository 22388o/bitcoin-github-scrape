    "body": "> Nodes which have whitelisted a blocks only peer will send them transactions.\r\n\r\nI don't think this is true. When a blocksonly node connects to a peer, it sends the version header with the relay field set to false:\r\n\r\n```\r\n   connman.PushMessage(pnode, CNetMsgMaker(INIT_PROTO_VERSION).Make(NetMsgType::VERSION, PROTOCOL_VERSION, (uint64_t)nLocalNodeServices, nTime, addrYou, addrMe,\r\n            nonce, strSubVersion, nNodeStartingHeight, ::fRelayTxes));\r\n```\r\n(https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/727a79836035b02e82e31a3c941396146eabc207/src/net_processing.cpp#L258-L259)\r\n\r\nThe peer receives that version message and sets fRelayTxes to false for that CNode. Any whitelist settings are not considered here:\r\n\r\n```\r\n            if (!vRecv.empty())\r\n                vRecv >> pfrom->fRelayTxes; // set to true after we get the first filter* message\r\n```\r\n(https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/727a79836035b02e82e31a3c941396146eabc207/src/net_processing.cpp#L1242-L1243).\r\n\r\nWhen the peer is sending messages to the blocksonly node, it checks the fRelayTxes field and explicitly clears all txs from its INV messages:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    if (!pto->fRelayTxes) pto->setInventoryTxToSend.clear();\r\n```\r\n(https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/727a79836035b02e82e31a3c941396146eabc207/src/net_processing.cpp#L3017)\r\n\r\nI've run some tests locally, and they seem to confirm that bitcoin nodes will not send transactions to blocksonly peers, regardless of whitelist settings.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, setting -blocksonly soft sets -walletbroadcast to false, so the blocksonly node won't even broadcast transactions it originates (which is sensible behaviour - nodes that broadcasts just their own transactions are terrible for transaction privacy).\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that the only ways to get transactions into a blocksonly node's mempool are to:\r\n1. connect to it with a non-compliant node which ignores the relay field in the version message; or\r\n2. explicitly set walletbroadcast to true and give up any transaction privacy.",

    "body": "Whitelisting was originally added so that armory user's mandatory Bitcoin nodes would still be able to reliably relay transactions when the armory software, which ignores frelaytxes, behind them wanted the transactions relayed.  I have been told that other commercial custom wallet code depend on this whitelist always relays behavior (which is too bad, because I dislike it and think we never should have done it that way).\r\n\r\nThe reason for this is because otherwise if your 'wallet' is implemented as [bitcoin core] - [custom stuff]  there is no way for your custom stuff to implement a rebroadcast like functionality similar to that of the integrated wallet.\r\n\r\nBlocksonly isn't even a document option yet, because it has no servicebits significance so nodes could avoid having all their automatic outbound peers be blocks only and ending up unable to relay transactions. It will be at least one BIP and two releases from being a documented option for that reason (unless the thinking changes), so I really don't think it matters how we handle its memory usage vs dbcache for now.\r\n",
