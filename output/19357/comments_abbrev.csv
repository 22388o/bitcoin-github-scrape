Sjors,2020-06-23 08:57:04,This doesn't produce a link (see markdown preview). I think you need to use `bitcoin/issues#19133`.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19357#discussion_r444070110,444070110,doc/release-notes-19133.md
laanwj,2020-06-24 12:13:41,"FWIW neither `#<issue>` or `bitcoin/issues#<issue>` produces a link in release notes (at least those published on the websites). They're markdown without github extensiosn. I don't think this is a problem though, people can look up the issue number of they want, it doesn't need to be full of links to github.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19357#discussion_r444849399,444849399,doc/release-notes-19133.md
MarcoFalke,2020-06-24 12:27:14,I think the goal is so that the verbose paragraphs refer to the list of merged pull requests below (and again those refer to the actual pull requests on github?),https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19357#discussion_r444856614,444856614,doc/release-notes-19133.md
