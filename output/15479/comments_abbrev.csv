practicalswift,2019-02-25T23:14:14Z,@MarcoFalke Out of curiosity: have you tried `black`? Some major Python open source projects switched over to `black` during 2018.

jnewbery,2019-02-26T15:04:57Z,"I'm vaguely against this if it encourages people to submit style changes that aren't part of the style guide.
