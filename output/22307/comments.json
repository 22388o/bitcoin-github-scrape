    "body": "I'm not sure this is the direction we want to be moving in. Ideally, our transaction and block relay logic are mostly separate. It'd be good to disentangle any logic/state in our net_processing code that has tight coupling between the two.\r\n\r\nThe root cause here seems to be that the block download timeout is way too long in most cases, and should be significantly reduced once the node is out of initial sync and at the tip. That timeout isn't specific to compact blocks and could be reduced for all block downloads.",
