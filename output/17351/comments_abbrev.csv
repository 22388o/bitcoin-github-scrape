RandyMcMillan,2019-11-03 00:23:06,@laanwj - I apologize for the PR noise. For some reason I can't reopen PRs. It is probably something I did. (forced push setting in your admin settings) - I have since figured out my workflow. So if it is an admin setting on your side - I apologize and have since implemented my own build environment and will only create PRs once I have tested my changes personally FIRST! Again sincere apology.  di,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17351#issuecomment-549093194,549093194,
