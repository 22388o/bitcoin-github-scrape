    "body": "Keep in mind that the RPC interface is intended for software to use, not people.\n\nSpeaking of Python, Jeff Garzik's python-bitcoinlib library now has a decent RPC interface - you might find it useful to use it to write code to automate whatever tasks you find the RPC interface useful for. I'm working on \"pythonizing\" it further to make using it more Pythonic, see my pythonize branch: https://github.com/petertodd/python-bitcoinlib/tree/pythonize Jeff has said that he sees my work as the direction the library will go in the future, so feel free to write code against it; that branch isn't going to be rebased prior to merging at this point.\n\nA small and easy to understand example of it being used for a real-world task is my dust-b-gone program: https://github.com/petertodd/dust-b-gone\n\nHope that helps!\n",

Thanks for it, now is my problem solved :-)\n\nAnd yes, I agree that RPC commands should be processed by software, not people. Actually, this is only command that I feel necessity to use (so something in the GUI is missing). When coin control will be released, I think that this will be solved definitely.\n\nPeter, thank you for interesting branch, I look into it deeper.\n\nSo thanks again, problem is solved for me :-)\n",
