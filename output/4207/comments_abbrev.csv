Review is hard enough without having to sort out functional changes vs visual noise.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4207#issuecomment-43803164,43803164,
laanwj,2014-05-22T08:26:49Z,"Closing this again. I am not going to merge this. As I already commented in #4202, trivial code changes that turn to to be controversial are not a good use of our review and testing time.

rebroad,2014-05-22T04:51:45Z,"It's not a convention, it's a requirement of the C++ language to put braces if there is more than one statement. It's optional when there is only one statement, and considered good practice when it's a statement that's quite long, as is in this case (i.e. a long if statement).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4207#discussion_r12934913,12934913,src/main.cpp
