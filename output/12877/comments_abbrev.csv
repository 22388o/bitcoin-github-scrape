sipa,2018-04-04T06:03:17Z,"Sure, but there are many other options people may want to combine with the Tor specific ones (for example `-logtimestamps` or `-dbcache` or `-txindex` or `-maxconnections`). Some of these may be necessary in your particular setup; others may be personal preference.\n\nBut this document isn't trying to give a comprehensive overview of all options; just the Tor specific ones.

There is another instance of that at the bottom of the file, btw.\n\nWhich options you run with depend on your setup. For high performance systems, running without dbcache may be unacceptably slow for example.
