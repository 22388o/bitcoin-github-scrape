    "body": "I think maintaining several `Dockerfile` like this as one big advantage: We can use those as part of the CI to be sure bitcoind build correctly on the different OS which should be supported by Bitcoin, as well as running the tests on different distro. (Actually I think this is what we do for now only on ubuntu?)\r\n\r\n@sipsorcery for example maintain a dockerfile for building on Windows via msvc, and configured CI to run it. This way he can warn you when something break Windows msvc build. \r\nEven if you are not fan of windows, I think you will see the advantage to have it for your favorite linux distro instead of relying on outdated documentation and untested dev environment.\r\n\r\nIt is also way more useful than maintaining a documentation, as anybody can reproduce the build on their environment just by reading the dockerfile related to their OS.\r\n\r\nSee this as a documentation which can be checked automatically during CI.\r\n\r\nIt also has the advantage that people can easily distribute their own bitcoin core image with their favorite freshly backed commits.\r\n\r\nMy repo https://github.com/NicolasDorier/docker-bitcoin is good if you want just an official release, but I totally see the advantage of providing dockerfiles which build from sources.\r\n\r\nIt is big ACK for me. It is better than trying to maintain a documentation, but serve also other purposes.",

    "body": "I'd compare Dockerfile to RPM spec and docker-compose as a way to manage your containers, e.g systemctl/systemd for services, just portable across different OS versions. While you can run any docker image with 'docker run', it's much easier to start with docker-compose, which allows easier and faster configuration for running containers. In this case testnet/mainnet nodes can be started within one go, scale if needed. Network isolation/ports management provided out of the box, if you wanted 3 nodes, you do not need to change configuration for port mapping, as compose will assign random host -> same port in container, etc...",

    "body": "As someone new to bitcoin compilation, I found getting a gitian build up and running quite complicated, especially on an OSX machine trying to use virtualization. \r\n\r\nI get the motivations around providing Dockerfiles in external projects but that means there is no (obvious) \"source of truth\" for getting started. If we want more devs poking at bitcoin I think it would be good that there was an official Dockerfile here that just gave you a build that you could play with locally (the intention being development, not production). That way you could test your changes easily. I was about to submit one but then saw this effort and decided to pile on my comment. \r\n\r\nI greatly support making it easier for new devs to get a local image running and docker provides exactly that.\r\n\r\nA few prior comments may not be entirely familiar with how docker works. We need provide only one file and that file will be universal and will not require any maintenance as it will self-document all the dependencies. A CI build could be used to verify that the container builds and produces the bitcoind binary, which is all that's necessary to make sure nothing is broken as far as deps go. In this regard it's much simpler than an rpm spec and not directly comparable.",

If you google bitcoin on docker you get a variety of blog posts and repos. It's not that hard to provide a dockerfile and make sure it's working which ensures that it's as easy as possible to run a node. If more nodes is what we want, then providing a production friendly way to spin one up is not a bad idea.",

    "body": "> If this pull request is to be used to add a devel dockerfile, I'd suggest prefixing the title with \"test\" or \"qa\".\r\n\r\nFiles in this pull request would match the prod setup. We use it the way it is to run and scale nodes in prod environment. I'd suggest that better way would be to create a separate pull req for development environment as it will differ significantly and close this if there's no need for prod env. Though, I would agree @skwp that official production friendly docker environment would be nice to have. As for someone having resources it's as easy as one command to run x prod/test nodes in the current containerised infrastructure. And I don't see how it would influence deployment as mentioned by @promag apart from the fact that it would make it much easier to deploy and manage.",
