petertodd,2014-05-20T08:05:05Z,"As I said privately to schildbach I'm out of country and don't have the ability to log into that server for another week. (Laptop died unexpectedly)\n\nAs discusses on the mailing list DNS seeds should be best effort; inability to handle them being down is a security issue. \n\nAnyway, if you want you can have your funds back from the grant. \n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4203#issuecomment-43596980,43596980,
laanwj,2014-05-20T08:08:34Z,"Let's just wait another week or two then. There is no hurry here, it's not like the change would propagate instantly. Also, bitcoind should be able to handle non-working DNS seeds fine, so if it doesn't this is a good test case.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4203#issuecomment-43597264,43597264,
petertodd,2014-05-20T08:13:10Z,"Thanks. And yeah, a week ago I thought it'd just be a week but unexpectedly found myself changing plane tickets yet again to speak at the Tel Aviv Bitcoin meet up next week. \n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4203#issuecomment-43597633,43597633,
schildbach,2014-05-20T08:16:38Z,"@petertodd You just pointed at other people so I assumed you won't look at it.\n\n@laanwj I heard of at least of one case of bitcoin-qt not being able to bootstrap, because Matt's node (the only one returned by his seed) is also down. So if this is a test case, it has failed.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4203#issuecomment-43597932,43597932,

petertodd,2014-05-20T08:22:17Z,Semi-failed - in bitcoin-qt you can just use -addnode once of course and after that you don't need the seeds again. Other apps are less robust of course. \n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4203#issuecomment-43598480,43598480,

schildbach,2014-05-20T09:11:11Z,"@wtogami I don't see any alternative for bootstrapping. IRC seeds have been abandoned a long time ago. Hardcoded nodes get outdated very quickly.

petertodd,2014-05-20T09:27:34Z,"Bitcoin Core has a hard coded fallback list. (we need to add that for testnet for code parity at the very least)\n\nSecondly bootstrapping should only need to be done once, not every time the node starts up. \n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4203#issuecomment-43604226,43604226,
schildbach,2014-05-20T09:32:12Z,"@petertodd Hardcoded nodes get outdated very quickly. Heck, even hardcoded DNS seed lists get outdated very quickly, as proven by the current situation.\n\nI agree about further node startups. That part just hasn't been coded, and it cannot be done with the current bitcoinj API.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4203#issuecomment-43604650,43604650,
petertodd,2014-05-20T09:38:09Z,"I'm not sure I'd call the current situation ""outdated"" - again, the seeds are best effort.  In particular, just removing a non-malicious, if incompetently run, seed isn't very useful compared to adding another redundent one. \n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4203#issuecomment-43605173,43605173,
laanwj,2014-05-20T10:52:19Z,@schildbach If all the bootstrap nodes are down you can hardly blame the software. Removing bootstraps isn't going to solve the problem in that case. It would remove all redundancy.\n\nIf bootstrapping for the testnet is important we need _more_ bootstraps not less.\n\nClosing this.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4203#issuecomment-43611110,43611110,
schildbach,2014-05-20T11:38:32Z,"@laanwj It wasn't me blaming the software. Maybe you're referring to @wtogami 's comment?\n\nI'm trying to contribute by keeping the list of seeds up to date. If that means at some point we have no seeds any more, well then we're at least honest about the situation.\n\nI'd appreciate if we could keep this pull open until the issue is resolved.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4203#issuecomment-43614646,43614646,
petertodd,2014-05-21T01:05:18Z,"@schildbach I think your definition of ""up to date"" is flawed: if my DNS seed is up 90% of the time, and someone else's is up 90% of the time, we've got 99% uptime between the two of them. (Uncorrelated obviously) A much better pull request would be the addition of another DNS seed. Perhaps you want to run one?\n\nWhether or not the development fund is getting good value for its money is another m",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4203#issuecomment-43701865,43701865,
leofidus,2014-05-21T02:43:27Z,"I'm not sure why we're even discussing to remove a seed simply because of some downtime. If the seed would be up 50% of the time, that would be enough to justifiy having it configured. And as long as it will come online again before the next release, there's absolutely no point in removing it just to add it again.\n\nIf the seed would be gone forever this would be another issue, but as it seem it ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4203#issuecomment-43706759,43706759,
laanwj,2014-05-21T07:01:15Z,"@schildbach Right, I think there is a misunderstanding here. The list of seeds in chainparams.cpp is not meant to be a day-to-day reflection of which DNS seeds which are up. That would result in a lot of git diff chatter :) If it was down for months at a time, I would agree with you and remove the seed.\n\nMaybe someone should write a document with requirements for DNS seeds.
