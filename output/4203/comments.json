    "body": "@schildbach Right, I think there is a misunderstanding here. The list of seeds in chainparams.cpp is not meant to be a day-to-day reflection of which DNS seeds which are up. That would result in a lot of git diff chatter :) If it was down for months at a time, I would agree with you and remove the seed.\n\nMaybe someone should write a document with requirements for DNS seeds. But having 99% uptime is not one of those. Due to the nature of P2P networks I'd rather have more, sometimes unreliable DNS seeds than a few very-reliable ones.\n",
