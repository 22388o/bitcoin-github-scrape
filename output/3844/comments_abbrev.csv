laanwj,2014-03-11T07:46:55Z,This needs some testing:\n1. Set -testnet/-regtest on command line\n2. Set -testnet/-regtest in configuration file in data directory\n3. Specify both -testnet and -regtest: Does error message still work?\n4. Check with mainnet URI and testnet URI\n   - Do URIs still affect testnet/mainnet when launching\n   - Are URIs sent to the right process if both testnet and mainnet is running?\n5.
