    "body": "Not against this change, but I wouldn't suggest doing too much work for insecure_rand:\n- It's called insecure_rand because it shouldn't be used for anything requiring security, it shouldn't matter for its use case if it generates the same sequence every time. If anything does that is a bug.\n- One current goal is to replace replace the OpenSSL PRNG with built-in Fortuna implementation - as Fortuna is so fast it will also be used for insecure_rand, see #5885\n",
