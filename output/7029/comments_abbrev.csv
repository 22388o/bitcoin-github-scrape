sdaftuar,2015-11-16T15:26:08Z,"@MarcoFalke The framework for testing multiple binaries is still in place.  The methods I used in this pull (especially using invalidateblock/reconsiderblock over and over) should probably be done a better way somehow, but I haven't thought about how I'd do it again if I were going to reimplement.\n\nAs for the meat of this test, it is just implementing the script tests that are performed by the u",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7029#issuecomment-157066526,157066526,

laanwj,2015-11-20T09:35:55Z,Removing unmaintained and dead code is good practice. Anyone that wants to 'resurrect' the code can always get it from git history.\n\nSpeaking of which - I'd really like to re-enable the rpcbind.py test without the IPv6 part until the a new stable libevent is in common use.
