maaku,2012-09-26T21:10:13Z,"This can't lead to a blockchain fork. These opcodes aren't on mainnet, and wouldn't be accepted on mainnet anyway by any existing client. They would be illegal before the change, and they would be illegal after the change. It only changes the behavior of a hypothetical client that relaxes IsStandard() script restrictions.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1869#issuecomment-8906463,8906463,

Transactions may appear in the blockchain, even if they fail IsStandard().\n\nThe set of acceptable behaviors is much larger than the set of relay-able IsStandard() behaviors.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1869#issuecomment-8906613,8906613,
