za-kk,2020-05-31 12:21:13,"Concept NACK - as mentioned in #16808, an `upstream` fix for this would seem more suitable to me, rather than hard coding a fix into this project. \n\nHowever I would defer to someone else who has a better understanding of `Qt` and the overall project than myself.\n\n`ku_IQ` seems to work correctly for me.
