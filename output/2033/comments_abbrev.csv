rebroad,2012-12-20T17:33:12Z,@sipa it looks like it was a bug that could have successfully created a DOS attack that may even have broken the network - i.e. create loads of conflicting transactions so that the mempool fills up to its limit and then the nodes would have stopped passing on new transactions... yes/no?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2033#issuecomment-11582771,11582771,
gmaxwell,2012-12-20T17:36:19Z,"No, not reallyâ€”  because it requires mining blocks that have later spends than everyone else had accepted. So it's naturally limited by the attacker's ability to mine blocks.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2033#issuecomment-11582870,11582870,

rebroad,2012-12-21T13:41:45Z,"Why would orphan flooding be a more potent attack than filling the mempool?
