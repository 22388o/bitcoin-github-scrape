dhruv,2020-09-26 18:36:31,Nit: I found these next 6 lines added complexity to something that was very clear thus far. Do you think the simpler formula makes it easier to reason about the size of the bloom filter?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19968#discussion_r495483350,495483350,src/bloom.h

laanwj,2020-09-30 11:23:51,"How does this render on doxygen? If it is markdown style you'd likely want to quote an inline script using triple-backquotes.\n\nTBH I'm not sure the python script adds much in the first place. Sometimes a simple but good-enough approximation is better for documentation purposes. Is this level of precision necessary?\n\n(edit: whoops, didn't mean to click the resolve conversation button)",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19968#discussion_r497433612,497433612,src/bloom.h
robot-dreams,2020-10-02 03:31:35,"Yeah, fair question @laanwj . I picked this up from the ""up for grabs"" #19130 but I could go either wayâ€”if we think the extra precision doesn't really help then we can close this PR.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19968#discussion_r498605464,498605464,src/bloom.h

robot-dreams,2020-10-02 04:10:52,Thanks for the input! Agreed that the extra complexity from the Python script is not worthwhile for the small accuracy gain; I'll update.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19968#discussion_r498611401,498611401,src/bloom.h
