MarcoFalke,2017-08-13T10:32:33Z,"Looks like my compression was slightly more efficient. (I used `contrib/devtools/optimize-pngs.py`)\n\nAlso, rewriting existing files in the git repo will keep the old versions around. Probably not worth trying to reduce the size...\n\nI reverted the change to the existing files and force pushed the commit to the litecoin repo.
