gmaxwell,2015-03-14T17:53:41Z,"I think having some fun, gimmicky sort of visualization would be fine and useful-- maybe even something that can run as a screensaver.

Some ideas...\n\nHighlight wallet txes in the mempool and maybe block flyovers, user will be looking for them.\n\nTo @gmaxwell's idea about ""motion,"" maybe it could represent the activity that interrelates the three objects shown.   New txes and blocks visually fly from the received-from node to their lists.

This gives the node GUI something more to show. +1 on making it a screensaver/fullscreen visualization.\n\n> Requires more node<->wallet communication but bitcoin core is suited for it.\n\nLet's not add anything wallet related here.

I can imagine I'd call this up during initial sync since it takes a while and it's doing a bunch of stuff, so maybe it would be interesting to visualize more of that process?

jonasschnelli,2015-03-16T19:44:16Z,Okay. I'll continue with this and try to make the screen layout flexible and add a fullscreen-size by default.\nI'd like to stick to the limit of not changing core code for now. A first version should be a independent new window with just a few lines of changes in the existing code. This will avoid risks of introducing new issues in the UI or the core.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5896#issuecomment-81893844,81893844,

jonasschnelli,2015-06-24T06:33:22Z,@luke-jr: The custom font is about 50% of the UX feeling. If i would go back to Arial or something which is available on OSX/Win/Linux it would really look bad.\nThe font is totally embedded. No need to install or anything like this.\nYou have to trust me here. :)\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5896#issuecomment-114746640,114746640,
luke-jr,2015-06-24T06:50:08Z,"As a user, I always consider inconsistency in fonts to be _bad_ UX. This one is particularly ugly IMO.

It probably because the resizing window feature is totally unfinished and was included halfway in the last rebase. :)\n\nFont: i really like to have a custom font here.
