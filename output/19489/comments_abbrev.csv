jnewbery,2020-08-03 12:41:03,I think this could be improved even more by making `add_p2p_connection()` wait until `is_connected` is True before returning. That way you could leave `check_connected` as True for `wait_for_verack()` as well as in p2p_filter.py,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19489#discussion_r464387191,464387191,test/functional/test_framework/mininode.py
