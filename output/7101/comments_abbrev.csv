raedah,2015-11-28T20:21:51Z,"This fixes the transaction list so that it shows 1 row per transaction instead of 2, and for the amount shows the transaction Net value. More importantly, this fixes the details view so that Debits and Credits are shown accurately, allowing one to discern what Debits and Credits were theirs in this transaction.\n\nWhat additions are you planning? \n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7101#issuecomment-160333304,160333304,
jonasschnelli,2015-11-30T07:43:59Z,@raedah: I think we should visually distinct coin-join transactions. Maybe adding in/out types for `sub.type = TransactionRecord::MixedXXX;` and use a different icon or row background (slightly different color) could make sense.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7101#issuecomment-160545987,160545987,
raedah,2015-12-03T07:49:27Z,"I suppose a coinjoin transaction would be identified as a transaction which has inputs which are yours but also has inputs that are not yours.

jonasschnelli,2015-12-16T07:20:28Z,This is not how merge things.\nI really think we first need a clear concept how we display CJ in the UI.\n\nAlso we mostly only merge PRs that are tested through multiple contributors (tested ACKs).\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7101#issuecomment-165021300,165021300,
raedah,2015-12-25T22:49:18Z,"There is already a definition that coinjoins fall under. It was already in the code as 'Mixed debit transaction'. This update fixes the logic to remove the assumption that Net positive transactions only have credits and no debits. Right now none of the debit information is being shown in the details view, which makes it extra difficult to try and discern what is happening with failed transactions ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7101#issuecomment-167265835,167265835,
