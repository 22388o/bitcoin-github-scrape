aalness,2014-09-25T21:19:21Z,"@laanwj I think it's a bit subjective. The ""addresses"" field serves no protocol purpose but is merely informative for the user. IMO, if an address can be derived from the script we should show it to the user and leave it to them to infer what the implication is if the number of signatures required doesn't match the number of addresses they see. That said, I don't feel strongly about this. The only",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4954#issuecomment-56885724,56885724,
sipa,2014-09-25T23:52:27Z,"IMHO, the fact that the ""addresses"" is plural is a historic mistake, confusing between addresses (shorthand notations for particular scripts) and addresses (as identifiers for particular public keys).\n\nEvery script by definition only has (at most) one address, though potentially we may recognize the script as involving particular keys.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4954#issuecomment-56902611,56902611,
