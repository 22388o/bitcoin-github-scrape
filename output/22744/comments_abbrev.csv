MarcoFalke,2021-08-19 11:12:54,To clarify: There is currently no Cirrus CI cron job running. Previously this was run on Travis every day with the last two days worth of commits. Now it runs on every push on the last 10 commits.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22744#issuecomment-901826779,901826779,

josibake,2021-08-23 15:41:05,"not important, but perhaps change the comment to ""sanity checking the last 10 commits seems sufficient and cheap."" i read the comment and was then surprised to see 10 (which is why i initially commented ""why 10""). \n\nfeel free to ignore, tho. could just be my brain. a few to me means ""greater than one but not many""",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22744#discussion_r694088765,694088765,ci/lint/06_script.sh
