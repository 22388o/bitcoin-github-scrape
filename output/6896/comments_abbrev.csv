laanwj,2015-10-28T09:13:49Z,"Oops.\nProbably needs a range check, >1 and <0 will still silently overflow.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6896#issuecomment-151775265,151775265,
dcousens,2015-10-28T10:04:55Z,"@laanwj I think the issue was that it would overflow to 0.\nAt least that was my understanding.\n\nIn any case, a range check would be sane.\nOr just `min(max(dFrequency, 0), 1)`\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6896#issuecomment-151788664,151788664,
laanwj,2015-10-28T10:25:25Z,Isn't _any_ overflow an issue?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6896#issuecomment-151793384,151793384,
instagibbs,2015-10-28T14:37:11Z,"Right now it doesn't appear overflow as currently used(post-fix), but probably a good idea to internally check.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6896#issuecomment-151865875,151865875,
laanwj,2015-10-30T23:37:36Z,"Apparently a range clamp is already done in init.cpp. That's good enough, going to merge this.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6896#issuecomment-152674051,152674051,
dcousens,2015-10-28T03:45:25Z,Any reason not to cast explicitly?\n`std::static_cast<int>(dFrequency * 4294967295.0)`?\n\nIMHO it might have made this more obvious to reviewers.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6896#discussion_r43215996,43215996,src/txmempool.h
jgarzik,2015-10-29T00:44:51Z,"Agree w/ @dcousens \n\nAdditionally, raw big numbers with no explanation comment should be avoided.  I know it's 2^32 but it's not immediately obvious to every code reader.\n\nThis should be uint_max-1 and getdouble() should be similar.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6896#discussion_r43337648,43337648,src/txmempool.h
