I will test too.\n\nI still think that whitelist drastically changing our P2P behavior (instead of merely bypassing resource limits/banning/eviction) is highly surprising, and undermines the utility of whitelisting if we're unable to unlink them; so I'd rebase 7099 on top of this and be open to making it default to on.\n\nI think long term we should have another p2p message type which means \"force relay this transaction\" which we ignore the force part for non-whitelisted peers. ... we we don't manage to get initial transaction broadcast out of the basic p2p relaying mechanism first. \n",
