I will test too.\n\nI still think that whitelist drastically changing our P2P behavior (instead of merely bypassing resource limits/banning/eviction) is highly surprising, and undermines the utility of whitelisting if we're unable to unlink them; so I'd rebase 7099 on top of this and be open to making it default to on.\n\nI think long term we should have anoth",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7106#issuecomment-159995586,159995586,
