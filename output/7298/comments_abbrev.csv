But `-prune=1` should fall back to `MIN_DISK_SPACE_FOR_BLOCK_FILES` (currently 550MB). Otherwise – i guess – you calculate the wrong min space requirement?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7298#discussion_r48961759,48961759,src/qt/intro.cpp

But what if we change the constants. `-prune=1` only results in 3GB because you use `std::ceil` and a chainstate size of 2GB.\nI just think the require space should be calculated with respecting the MIN_DISK_SPACE_FOR_BLOCK_FILES, otherwise we give wrong promises to the users (even if it f",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7298#discussion_r48963503,48963503,src/qt/intro.cpp

MarcoFalke,2016-01-07T11:57:54Z,"Makes sense. What about merging this as is and then backport to 0.12, so translators don't have to go through all translations to update two chars.\n\nAfterward, we can apply your proposed changes to this in 0.13 and maybe additionally add another sentence to the translation which tells that pruning is enabled?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7298#discussion_r49066287,49066287,src/qt/intro.cpp
