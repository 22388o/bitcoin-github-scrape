That's surprising to me, as these are errors that (beside the case modified now in 1.17) usually indicates actual database corruption.\n\nOnce this is merged I think we should experiment with setting paranoid_checks to true, so corruptions other than s",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4161#issuecomment-42810987,42810987,
