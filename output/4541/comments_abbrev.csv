The previous checkpoint has a difficulty more than high enough to make that DoS attack extremely expensive to pull off, and it's a continual source of confusion as to the actual security model of Bitcoin.\n\nIt's about time we stop updating them every release.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4541#issuecomment-49469837,49469837,
