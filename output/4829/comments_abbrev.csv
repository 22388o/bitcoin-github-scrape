sipa,2014-09-03T07:13:08Z,Would it suffice to log this once at startup instead? It's an immutable string anyway.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4829#issuecomment-54260057,54260057,
rebroad,2014-09-03T07:22:45Z,"@sipa well, yes, but they same could be said for other items in the version string, e.g. protocol version - do you want these moving out of the line per node also?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4829#issuecomment-54260773,54260773,
sipa,2014-09-03T07:26:51Z,@rebroad That sounds reasonable; no need to log it on every established connection.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4829#issuecomment-54261071,54261071,

rebroad,2014-09-03T18:05:50Z,"Not sure I understand. This is logged only once in the debug.log now, as @sipa requested. Do we want it logged once, or every time it's used? It was initially every time, (as was PROTOCOL_VERSION), but then I changed it to just once.\n\nThere's much info in debug.log that isn't available via RPC, so I'm assuming you're not suggesting we move everything to RPC instead.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4829#issuecomment-54339624,54339624,

laanwj,2014-09-04T07:51:22Z,"Agree with @jgarzik here. I think what you're trying to do (collect statistics by parsing the log) is misguided. The log is not an interface, RPC is. A better solution would be to have an external tool periodically collect the information through RPC. This is what I'm trying to say in  https://github.com/rebroad/bitcoin/commit/a973b79e78cf4139efd8d778736cb7831ce775b6#commitcomment-7654200 too.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4829#issuecomment-54424799,54424799,

laanwj,2014-09-03T08:54:12Z,"Not 100% sure what you are trying to accomplish with this, but wouldn't it be better to offer this information on RPC (`getnetworkinfo`)?
