TheBlueMatt,2017-10-14T23:05:35Z,"Yea, I mean this and labels in the same release sounds good, though I cant say I'm excited about removing accounts pre-labels.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11497#issuecomment-336673499,336673499,
jnewbery,2017-10-16T18:45:20Z,Thanks for tackling this @achow101 . I'd echo @TheBlueMatt's feedback that labels needs to be in place before we remove the accounts system. The `-deprecatedrpc` framework was put in place with a specific purpose: to make sure that RPCs can be removed or changed in a release without suddenly breaking clients. The idea is that the `-deprecatedrpc` option is only in place for a single release before,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11497#issuecomment-336991350,336991350,
achow101,2017-11-30T16:42:58Z,"Rebased. \n\nThis should be done after #7729 is merged. I will update it accordingly then.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11497#issuecomment-348246839,348246839,

ryanofsky,2018-04-11T10:39:29Z,Might be helpful for updating this PR: release notes https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/release-notes-pr12892.md list the parts of the accounts api that are deprecated.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11497#issuecomment-380407428,380407428,
Sjors,2018-04-11T10:44:50Z,Concept ACK. Agree with @ryanofsky that all prerequisites seem to be in place now.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11497#issuecomment-380408719,380408719,
jnewbery,2018-04-11T13:07:20Z,@achow101 - I've already started rebasing this on #12892. I'll open my own PR later today unless you really want to keep hold of this one.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11497#issuecomment-380444976,380444976,
achow101,2018-04-11T16:10:04Z,Closing in favor of whatever @jnewbery does because I'm too lazy to rebase this.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11497#issuecomment-380508513,380508513,
meshcollider,2017-10-20T05:47:30Z,"Also, this should be re-purposed to label rather than removed, after #7729 merge, same as other RPCs with account arguments",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11497#discussion_r145882425,145882425,src/wallet/rpcwallet.cpp
