laanwj,2014-07-20T05:32:09Z,"Same here, if you need a const cast that's an indication that something should not be const, or (in case of caching and such) that you need a 'mutable' field.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4561#discussion_r15147643,15147643,src/coins.cpp
domob1812,2014-07-20T18:36:36Z,"I understand your point.  In this case, however, I believe that the ""const"" is justified - one could simply copy the implementation of the non-const FetchCoins and replace ""iterator"" by ""const_iterator"".  I used the const_cast to avoid code duplication - but if you prefer, I can also implement it with a private template routine that can then be used for both the const and the non-const variant of ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4561#discussion_r15151190,15151190,src/coins.cpp
domob1812,2014-07-20T18:37:42Z,"In this case, I guess the best way forward is to simply duplicate the three lines of code from non-const GetCoins (as they are rather trivial).  Is that ok?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4561#discussion_r15151196,15151196,src/coins.cpp
laanwj,2014-07-23T12:07:03Z,"Hm - I see the point now! A template-based common function would be slightly less evil, although if moving the implementation to the header pulls in extra dependencies, it may be best to keep it like this.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4561#discussion_r15283800,15283800,src/coins.cpp

sipa,2014-07-27T14:49:29Z,I'm fine with the const_cast here. It's a typical example of not propagating constness correctly automatically.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4561#discussion_r15439635,15439635,src/coins.cpp
