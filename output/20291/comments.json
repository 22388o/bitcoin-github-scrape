That comment is just plain wrong. It doesn't find the entry, it always creates it. And it doesn't update the nTime and nServices. I think it's probably vestigial from when the code was being written. Perhaps logic was moved around (what it's describing is closer to what the `Add_()` function does), but it's inaccurate now.",
