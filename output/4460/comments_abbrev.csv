AlreadyHave doesn't currently return true if the tx is not an orphan but is rejected from the mempool; so as it stands, rejected tx must not be removed from the map since they are never included in AlreadyHave. #4542 would make this PR work.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4460#issuecomment-49150779,49150779,
