Even, a single function must not/should not represent the behavior of the whole system (if someone would define our system behavior to reject 0 values everywhere).\n`AmountFromValue` is also used in `createrawtransaction` and there i could imagi",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6239#issuecomment-109397022,109397022,

The old check `dAmount <= 0.0 || dAmount > 21000000.0` did not allow zero amounts, whereas `MoneyRange` allows `nValue >= 0 && nValue <= MAX_MONEY`.\n\nUnsure what to do here. The no-brainer solution would be to restore the old behavior, however \n- There is one place in the source where this is worked around with an ugly hack: https:",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6239#discussion_r31792940,31792940,src/rpcserver.cpp
