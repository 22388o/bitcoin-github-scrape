To this end I am curious if there will be incorporated a floating relay fee ~ e.g., @sipa's https://github.com/sipa/bitcoin/commit/6498673f99da9976df170052648ff2f0026210d2 ~ which was removed by @morcos from a prior iteration in the process of getting to this point.  Shouldn't this (or something like it) be reincorporated at this point, or am I misunderstanding / jumping the gun?\n",

    "body": "@TheBlueMatt  Agreed, the right wallet behavior should likely be the same regardless of which mempool limiting approach we take.  I think this pull is now in good enough shape to try to digest, so that people who are interested can look at this, #6673, #6722, or any other suggestions that are proposed so that we we can pick an approach to focus on, which we can then try to refine.  \n\nI am definitely curious if people have ideas about whether it's problematic for a wallet's transactions to not make it into the mempool in the first place, or get evicted from the mempool?  Or if there are downsides to accepting one's own transactions into your mempool if you can only do so by bypassing the limiting logic?\n\nRegarding your CPFP comment, that seems like an interesting idea but I don't have a clear picture in my head of how that could actually be implemented.  Seems like the tx relay logic would need to be reworked (along with the logic for not re-requesting rejected transactions), and I'm not sure what the logic would be of how to figure out which combinations of transaction bundles to try (the naive algorithm seems like it's n^2 in the length of the chain?  maybe I'm missing something....).\n",
