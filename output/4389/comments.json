    "body": "On one hand, this is very useful for diagnostics.\n\nOn the other hand this moves our internal anti-DDoS mechanism into the P2P interface. This means that\na) we can't change it to some other mechanism anymore at a later time\nb) other node implementations need to use the same or a similar system\n\nNot sure how much of a drawback this is. Accumulating a ban score is a straightforward mechanism. All in all I'm mildly positive about this. But I'd suggest proposing this on the mailing list.\n",

    "body": "I think there's a general intent to be conservative about offences causing DoS scoring; in particular, anything that can be relayed by older nodes can generally not trigger DoS, as it could lead to network partitioning.\n\nThey are not random frequently occurring things - they are highly exceptional, intended to never trigger for non-attacking nodes, and the only reason they don't always cause a disconnect/ban immediately is to limit the impact of a software bug.\n\nI consider them to be highly implementation specific, and not useful information that peers should care about or act upon. If you're developing a P2P client it's useful of course, but you'll need more information anyway for that case, and likely need to develop by running against a local node with -debug anyway.\n",

A good example of when this might be needed is with the recent pull that has been merged that allows nodes to double-spend. It was only noticed after the merge about a potential attack vector where nodes could be manipulated into being banned. If this patch (and a following patch to modify behaviour) were applied, then this would protect against all future examples of this happening. It would be quite easy to link the misbehave and reject messages. Simply remember the last \"reject\" message and the last message , and then when a \"misbehave\" message arrives, you'll have a good idea what it's referring to.\n\n@kazcw Above paragraph addresses your question also.\n",

I like the \"bye\" message idea also, although technically, it's not needed as all unknown commands are currently logged so any messages could be sent that way :) \n\nI'd be happy to write a commit now that sends bye messages prior to disconnects and ban 100s. For the ban <100s, what could be used? A reject message? e.g. a reject message is currently sent in response to multiple version messages.\n",
