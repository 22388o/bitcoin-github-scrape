leishman,2018-08-26T05:13:51Z,"@practicalswift I'm ok with removing the else statement, but the reason I added this is to improve the user experience. Currently a user has no reliable feedback regarding where bitcoind is getting config values. If an invalid conf file path is passed in, bitcoind doesn't tell the user this file doesn't exist and says it's using the file. If we remove the else statement, the user will have no idea",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14057#issuecomment-416014664,416014664,

leishman,2018-08-26T21:41:10Z,@practicalswift @Sjors the reason i didn't add that extra condition was for the following scenario: A user creates a `bitcoin.conf` file in the wrong directory and they can't figure out why bitcoind is not using their settings. At least with this change they will be able to see where bitcoind is looking by default for a configuration file and they will know that bitcoind does not see what it's loo,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14057#issuecomment-416074399,416074399,
Sjors,2018-08-28T10:56:00Z,"@leishman that makes sense. Perhaps if `-conf` is not set, the error could say ""No file exists _at the default location_ %s"", but maybe that's overkill.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14057#issuecomment-416542338,416542338,
