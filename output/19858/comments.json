Should we converge at least those to IsBlockOnlyConn() check?\r\n\r\nI actually didn't mean to necessarily include that `m_tx_relay == nullptr` in the `LogPrintf()` that I did; the clarification of changing to using the `IsBlockOnlyConn()` check was leftover from a previous version of this work where I was going to introduce a new connection type altogether, and the `m_tx_relay == nullptr` check would have been incorrect for identifying the peer type.\r\n\r\nIn this PR that change is unnecessary (though an improvement), but I guess I don't want to do a wholesale review of all the `m_tx_relay==nullptr` checks still in the code -- many of them are places where we check for `nullptr` before dereferencing, which I think would make sense to leave as-is.  Places in the code where we use that check to determine how to do something logical with that peer are different, and should be switched at some point.  If there are places like that which make this new code harder to understand, please flag and I can include fixes here, but I think since I'm not adding new peer-types I hope that wouldn't be necessary.",

These connections are short-lived, and generally speaking under normal circumstances rotation doesn't actually occur, because we're unlikely to get a new block from one of these connections rather than from one of our high-bandwidth compact block peers.  Even if rotation were to occur, I don't think #17428 has any meaningful negative consequences here -- keeping track of helpful block-relay peers seems an independently good idea.",

    "body": "> What would be the best arguments against bumping m_max_outbound_block_relay by 1?\r\n\r\nThe best argument I'm aware of: we use up more connection slots on listening nodes, which is a limited resource.  So if we start increasing the number of outbound connections we make, we should think hard about also increasing the default number of connections we expect a listening node to be able to handle.\r\n\r\nI think that these connections should be lightweight enough that we ought to be able to allocate more inbound connection slots to low-resource peers like these; however that is not easy for us to do until we have a way to communicate to our outbound peer when we connect that we're a block-relay-only peer and not planning to re-enable transaction relay later on in the connection's lifetime.\r\n\r\nMy plan to increase this number is to: (1) first propose a p2p protocol upgrade that would inform our peer that we're block-relay only, then (2) add support for reducing resources that we allocate to such inbound peers, and then (3) propose that we increase the number of inbound connections by accounting for block-relay inbounds differently from the rest, and finally (4) then increase the default number of outbound block-relay-only peers.\r\n\r\nBut if there are other concerns about increasing this number, I'd like to hear them!  I'm currently working on steps 1 and 2 in the above.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, I'm not inclined to propose increasing the number of connections in this PR, because I didn't want to use further permanent block-relay-only connections until we made more progress reducing the resource impact.",

An attacker's sybil if selected as extra-block-relay might be able to outrun a high-bandwidth compact blocks peers such that evicting this peer from its anchor slot.\r\n\r\nI don't think that is a big concern -- by construction, only 1 out of our current 2 block-relay-only peers will be able to be rotated this way, and to maintain this attack an adversary has to continually give us the best block faster than anyone else, which makes them not much of an attacker until they stop.  And once they stop, this logic continues to protect us because it's always connecting to new peers to sync tips.\r\n\r\n> With regards to functional test coverage we are limited by #19315 and mocking addresses of P2P connections I guess ?\r\n\r\nYeah, I'm not aware of any way to test this code in our current testing framework.  I believe that even after #19315, we still will not have a way to exercise the logic in `ThreadOpenConnections`, so I think manual testing is best for this PR.",

    "body": ">Should this wait until it's verified the new chain is valid?\r\n\r\n@luke-jr I'm interpreting your question as asking: \"Should we wait to decide which peer to keep and which to evict, until after any new chain received from the new peer has been validated?\"  If that question is not what you meant, please clarify.\r\n\r\nI think a good question is exactly what we want to happen if we connect to a peer that is on another (equal-work) fork.  (There's no real need to stay connected to a peer on a less-work chain, while a peer on a more-work chain will have its blocks downloaded and validated and we'll either stay connected because they gave us new blocks, or disconnect if the chain is invalid.)\r\n\r\nWith this PR, it's very likely we'd stay connected to a peer on an equal-work and evict an older peer, because our download logic is designed to download blocks on all chains with work equal to or greater than our current tip.  And then the eviction criteria would cause the old peer to be disconnected.  I think this is okay behavior; in the event that the new fork gets extended and is valid, it's probably better for us to have been connected to the part of the network graph that was working on that tip as well as the part of the graph working on the one we had.\r\n\r\nIf the alternate chain proves to be invalid, then we can disconnect, but arguably we've done some harm by losing our previous (potentially honest) block-relay-peer.  However, I think this is a negligible problem, for two reasons: we only ever rotate 1 of our 2 block-relay-peers this way, so there's no way to use this to disconnect us from all our peers.  Also, practically speaking, mining a block in order to have a chain at equal work as our current tip is an extremely expensive attack to pull off, and so while someone could do so in order to take over 1 of our peer slots, it's not sustainable to repeat block after block.  In practice, if this were to occur I'd expect it to happen at the time of a consensus fork (like segwit2x or bcash), in which case this would resolve shortly after the forking point, as the competing chain extends an invalid block, and we'd either eventually detect that (if that chain has more work) or ignore it (if it has less work).",

    "body": "I'm curious how the timings for this mechanism were chosen:\r\n\r\n- we'll connect to an additional block-relay-only peer every 300 seconds on average\r\n- we'll consider eviction of the additional block-relay-peer every 45 seconds\r\n- if the youngest block-relay-connection is less than 30 seconds old, then we won't disconnect it.\r\n\r\nThat means that the additional block-relay-only connection has a lifetime of 30-75 seconds (52.5 on average), and we make one every 300 seconds. We therefore have an additional block-relay-only connection for 52.5/300 = 17.5% of the time. Put differently, this PR increases the average number of block-relay-only connections we have from 2 to 2.175.\r\n\r\nWould it be simpler to simply increase the number of block-relay-only connections to 3, and then periodically evict the worst/youngest? That empty slot would then be filled using the normal mechanism in `ThreadOpenConnections()`. That seems like it'd give just as much protection as this approach (a new connection is tried every 300 seconds), but without adding yet another complex timing interaction between net and net_processing which is difficult to reason about and test. The downsides would be potentially a bit more churn in connections (since 100% of blocks can now cause the second-oldest block-relay-only peer to be evicted instead of 17.5% of blocks), a bit more resource usage on the node (which should be fine - if it can handle an additional connection 17.5% of the time, it can handle it 100% of the time), and a bit more usage of listening sockets (which again should be fine, it's much less of an impact than when we added block-relay-only connections in the first place).",

    "body": "@jnewbery I think the biggest difference between what is implemented here and what you seem to be suggesting is that your proposed approach would be much more aggressive about making outbound connections. When we increase the target number of connections we want to make, `ThreadOpenConnections` will constantly be trying to achieve that target, making connection attempts whenever we are below our target.  In this PR, we use a feeler-like approach to making these additional connections, which should be lower load on the network, as we just make one connection *attempt* every 5 minutes.\r\n\r\nAs for your question about how the times were chosen - the only new parameter here is the frequency of these block-relay-only connections (the existing 30 second and 45 second timers were re-used from the existing outbound peer eviction logic, and those were based on making sure we checked frequently enough that we didn't persist connections for a long time, while trying to give reasonably enough time for headers sync and block download to occur).  I figured adding about 2 connections every 10 minutes was not such a big increase in outbound connection initiation amount, though if reviewers are concerned about the frequency we could reduce it.  \r\n\r\nThe trade-off here is that the more frequently we make connections (and therefore add edges to the network graph of nodes), the more security we have against partitioning attacks, but also the more network load we sustain. I don't think we have a great framework for evaluating the load, so I'd just eyeball it and observe after we deploy it, and we can always tune it if we think it's excessive or insufficient.  From watching the logs on my own node to verify how frequently connections are made and how much bandwidth is used by these connections, these numbers seemed fine to me, fwiw.\r\n\r\nAlso, I don't think that we gain all that much in complexity reduction by going that route, as we still need to have intelligent eviction logic, which I think is where the meat of the complexity lies.  I took a quick look right now, and I believe the additional changes to `net.cpp` to support feeler-like connection behavior (versus just having a target of 3 peers, of which we'd always try to evict 1) seems to be about 4 lines of code (not including comments), and is patterned off the existing feeler logic. Not too bad?",

    "body": "(Oops, prematurely hit submit on this comment before I finished writing.)\r\n\r\n@jnewbery I fixed the unnecessary lock assertion in the latest commit.  My strong preference for now is to merge this PR as-is, as no problems seem to have emerged in review and testing thus far, it has several ACKs, this PR represents a substantial improvement in our peering behavior, and frankly this work has gotten stale for me, having been several months since I last worked on this extensively.  So if we can save minor improvements or tweaks for future work that would make progress much easier -- I'm not inclined to do minor rewrites at this point (and if there are major problems remaining I should just close this PR!).\r\n\r\nI think for some of the changes (like the `m_tx_relay==nullptr` thing), we could easily do that in a followup refactoring-only PR.  For some of the initialization sequence points that came up, I believe the code here is reasonable and correct, but there is room for further improvement too -- I think it's worth careful consideration of behavior changes that might be introduced in doing so, and since those seem non-essential to the behavior introduced here, I think this PR shouldn't be held up for such minor optimizations.\r\n\r\nI'd like to focus any further discussion on this PR on the actual behavior introduced (such as concerns about the timing of connections, maintenance or cognitive complexities introduced, or behaviors I've glossed over as unimportant such as the initialization sequence, if I'm mistaken and there are indeed significant concerns around how that will work).",

On my to-do list is to propose and implement support for negotiating block-relay only behavior at connection time; I think at that point we can add better understanding to our code for inbound versus outbound block-relay-only peers (as right now we have no way of knowing that an inbound peer is a block-relay-only peer).

    "body": "Code Review ACK b3a515c, only change since last time is dropping a useless `cs_main` taking. I manually tested a previous version of the PR, and not substantial change has been introduced since then which would alter behavior IMO.\r\n\r\n__________\r\n\r\n> The trade-off here is that the more frequently we make connections (and therefore add edges to the network graph of nodes), the more security we have against partitioning attacks, but also the more network load we sustain. I don't think we have a great framework for evaluating the load, so I'd just eyeball it and observe after we deploy it, and we can always tune it if we think it's excessive or insufficient.\r\n\r\nAFAIU this PR, I'm not worried about the network load introduced by this PR, whatever the metric we're picking (connection slots/application bandwidth/IP/TCP bandwidth). Let's assume a really worst-case scenario, where the victim node is always fallen-behind from a better-work chain by ~5 headers and has to download them every 5 min (EXTRA_BLOCK_RELAY_ONLY_PEER_INTERVAL). 80 * 5 * 12 * 24 * 30 = 3_456_000, this node will consume 3.45 MB by month from the network ? If I get the math right, I think that's fairly acceptable.\r\n\r\nThat said, I would be glad if we start to develop and sustain frameworks to evaluate question like network load which rightfully spawn up in this kind of work. Beyond agreeing on security model efficiency, having sound quantitative model would ease reaching Concept ACK/NACK.\r\n\r\n> I thought I did document this innet.h, but I think it would make sense to put a writeup of how all this works on our wiki, which I'd be happy to do after this is merged.                                       \r\n\r\nI know I'm a minority opinion, but I still feel we should have a sound discussion before dissociating further rationale from code by writing more documentation in the wiki instead of in-tree.                    \r\n\r\nContra:\r\n* splitting code rationale from code paths increase the risk of documentation being airy, hard to link back and easy outdated                                                                                      \r\n* rationale should be submitted to the same review process, wiki is free to edit for project members,, IMO code rationale is a much important than code correctness, because ultimately rationale is leading how code\r\nshould be\r\n* increase project reliance on centralized GH infrastructure of duplicated git copies\r\n\r\nI'm a big fan of the code documentation approach which has been done for #19988, and I hope to stick more to this kind of code documentation standard in the future.",

    "body": "> Testing this, I'm seeing some cases where the extra block-relay peer is being evicted for sending a tx, [...]\r\n\r\nLooking into this a bit further: I'm only seeing this coming from nodes advertising themselves as 0.20.1, and the timing seems like it's consistent with a 5s poisson delay since the connection is established. Not all 0.20.1 nodes are failing this way. I've just added some additional logging, and it looks like the txs they're advertising aren't particularly strange, but all the violating nodes seem to be running on cloud hosting (digital ocean, amazon, google cloud). So seems plausible that they're just buggy and lying about their version details?\r\n\r\nOne thing that might be worth considering: our sybil mitigation only works for concurrent connections -- our 10 regular outbounds all have to be in different netgroups because they're simultaneously connected, but 10 sequential extra block-relay-only could all end up to the same netgroup. Could fix this by keeping track of the last 10 extra connections we've tried, and trying to choose the next one from a different netgroup. ",

You obviously have NET logging enabled since you're seeing the \"receive version message\" line. These are outbound connections, so I'd expect to see \"send version message\" (in `InitializeNode()`) between \"Added connection peer\" (in `ConnectNode()`) and \"receive version message\" (in `ProcessMessage()`). Very odd.\r\n\r\nEven if we did have that logging in `PushNodeVersion()`, it doesn't include what the fRelay was set to. That'd be evidence that the peer is misbehaving and we don't have a bug.\r\n\r\nPerhaps peer message capture would help here (#19509)",

    "body": "> One thing that might be worth considering: our sybil mitigation only works for concurrent connections -- our 10 regular outbounds all have to be in different netgroups because they're simultaneously connected, but 10 sequential extra block-relay-only could all end up to the same netgroup. Could fix this by keeping track of the last 10 extra connections we've tried, and trying to choose the next one from a different netgroup.\r\n\r\n@ajtowns I think this is an interesting idea -- seems like it would be a strict improvement in security (in a mathematical sense, ie I can't imagine how our security could be any worse off with that approach); but I'm not sure if the additional complexity is worth the potential gain?  Not intrinsically opposed, but maybe this isn't low-hanging fruit either.",

The stale tip logic more aggressively seeks out a new peer to connect to (staying in that state until a new connection is actually made) while this logic fires once on a selection from addrman and gives up even if no connection is made. Moreover the stale tip logic is an eviction algorithm for full relay peers, while this logic is only for block relay peers. I think having rotation logic for both makes sense, though there is probably room to improve the interaction between these two behaviors in all the various cases we can think of. \r\n",

    "body": "@sdaftuar Thanks for explaining. Could this be a way to improve the interaction between the two behaviors?:\r\n\r\n1. Upon stale tip, seek extra outbound-block-relay more aggressively rather than a 5 minute interval (stay in that state until the tip is no longer stale). \r\n2. Novel block discovery by the extra outbound-block-relay triggers outbound-full-relay eviction.\r\n3. Eliminate extra outbound-full-relay connections.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the simpler starting point is just to implement (2)? Are there any downsides/known attacks if we do that?",

The fact that a stronger attack A can easily bypass counter-measure for attack B doesn't invalidate worthiness of counter-measure B.\r\n\r\nFor this new periodic-chain-sync counter-measure, I do agree it improves against eviction logic takeover or partial addrman poisoning.

There's already a commit in this branch for _Use conn_type to identify block-relay peers, rather than m_tx_relay == nullptr_, so I don't see why we wouldn't fix them all up at the same time.\r\n\r\nUsing `m_tx_relay == nullptr` is more indirect and confusing for reviewers. See for example https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20217#issuecomment-728275457:\r\n\r\n> I think I'm confused because the check for block-relay-only connections in the code is sometimes to see if m_tx_relay exists, which is non-intuitive because block-relay-only also implies that addrs are not gossiped with this peer either, not just transactions, and sometimes to call IsBlockOnlyConn().",
