The underlying (psychological) issue is that the progress bar makes the sync look like a normal linear download of a fixed-size file in the mind of users. Adding a percentage adds to this illusion.\n\nEven though in reality it fetches a growing tree structure of uncertain (at least to any one observer) size, of which only the longest path is significant.\n\nSo ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2103#issuecomment-11369569,11369569,
