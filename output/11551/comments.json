    "body": "I was brain-farting a bit and thinking that (signed)(2^63 - 1)*-1  was UB but it's actually the opposite case where -1 times a maximally negative number that I was thinking of (-(signed)(2^63 - 1)-1)*-1. ... I'm hesitant to spend more time reviewing these kinds of changes than they take to write. It was also unclear if bits returned 63 or 64 on 1<<63, and I ultimately wrote a test to check.  It's easy to introduce bugs with changes like this, and hard to review them to be absolutely sure. Sorry for the distraction there.",
