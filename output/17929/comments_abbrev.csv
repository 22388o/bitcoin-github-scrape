fanquake,2020-01-15 21:53:19,"> How is this different from #16791?\n\n@MarcoFalke Despite similar naming, this is not the same thing as LTO. This will optimize the symbol hash tables in binaries, whereas LTO does intermodular optimizations. More info on either: [Optimizing Linker Load Times](https://lwn.net/Articles/192624/) and [LTO](https://llvm.org/docs/LinkTimeOptimization.html).",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17929#issuecomment-574873621,574873621,

dongcarl,2020-03-09 21:14:21,"Concept ACK, although would like to see this in Gitian/release builds instead of default configure. At some point we should probably add a doc to the repo of recommended configure flags and what they do.\n\n-----\n\nIt seems to me that, when supplied with `-O2`:\n\n- `ld` optimizes the hash chain size for the symbol hash table, which may lead to larger outputs\n- `ld.gold` optimizes the out",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17929#issuecomment-596783259,596783259,
