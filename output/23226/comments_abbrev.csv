theuni,2021-10-12 16:07:31,"@laanwj Yes, but in this case we're actually opting out of some of those protections because of the semantics of Span. By default, the returned iterator type for a potentially dangling reference is a `std::ranges::dangling`. By opting in to `enable_borrowed_range`, we get a real return type. Otherwise it'd fail to compile the `*iter` dereference in the `printf`. This is also used by `std::string_v",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23226#issuecomment-941155912,941155912,
