laanwj,2012-04-30T19:03:02Z,I'll never understand this war on spaces. IMO this just breaks other patches for reason at all.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1170#issuecomment-5424971,5424971,
jgarzik,2012-04-30T19:16:40Z,"It is a very minor change, yes, but it pops up again and again in pull requests for various projects.  Sometimes editors automatically trim this stuff, which may generate larger patches (with changes in unexpected areas) down the road.\n\nOthers will submit this stuff, as was already done in #1136, so might as well make our stuff uniform all in one go.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1170#issuecomment-5425248,5425248,
Diapolo,2012-04-30T23:31:23Z,Great big and never-ending ACK ;).\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1170#issuecomment-5430469,5430469,
rebroad,2012-05-02T17:41:38Z,Well done. Does this mean I'll have more free disk space after applying this?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1170#issuecomment-5467480,5467480,
gmaxwell,2012-05-05T18:55:51Z,I think we should pull this in 0.7.0 after pulling most of the other outstanding 0.7.0 pulls that this would break.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1170#issuecomment-5529556,5529556,
Diapolo,2012-05-06T10:36:27Z,"I think this should be rebased once more (if needed) and then get merged. Why should this even break pulls, it removes not a single line only spaces?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1170#issuecomment-5534655,5534655,

jgarzik,2012-06-27T16:03:55Z,Closing.  Will run script to do this immediately prior to 0.7rc1 release...\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1170#issuecomment-6607555,6607555,
