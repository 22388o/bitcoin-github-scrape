practicalswift,2018-03-20T14:34:28Z,"Yes, upstreams' tests are intentionally not checked by `lint-tests.sh` since we don't want Travis to block on things where we need help from upstreams.

eklitzke,2018-03-21T07:43:11Z,"There is a serious shell quoting problem here. This isn't just a nit, it changes the semantics of the test.
