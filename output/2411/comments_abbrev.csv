Tested on mainnet and testnet and peer finding works as expected; with the DNS seeds disabled the pnSeed table finds a seed correctly so I don't think you made any mistakes.\n\nIf we do this we should create a pnTestnetSeed table. I also like the suggestion that came up on IRC of making an addnode UI eventually.\n\nStrange, it must be dusty in here or something...\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2411#issuecomment-15372941,15372941,
