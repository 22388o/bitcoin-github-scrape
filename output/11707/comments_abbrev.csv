MarcoFalke,2017-11-17T19:23:45Z,"nit: Are the default values required for `headers` and `inv`? For the case of `inv_node`, we must only ever send `inv`s and `headers==[]`.

jnewbery,2017-11-17T22:11:26Z,"Right, having the default arguments like this allows looser or stricter testing. If the function is called without both arguments, then the testing is looser. We can make it tighter by explicitly calling with one of the arguments set to an empty list.\n\nI think it's ok as is, but I'm also happy to change if you have a better suggestion.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11707#discussion_r151801513,151801513,test/functional/sendheaders.py
