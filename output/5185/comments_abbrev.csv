gavinandresen,2014-10-31T15:18:18Z,ACK from me.\n\nRE: adding a few minutes to the test time: I think we should start with more testing at every PR; we can optimize or do a run-expensive-tests-against-git-HEAD-once-a-day if it becomes too much.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5185#issuecomment-61275816,61275816,

theuni,2014-10-31T18:06:52Z,Ok. I picked the current ones (wallet/listtransactions/forknotify) because they were the ones listed for the old pull-tester. Are there any others that should be hooked up initially?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5185#issuecomment-61302968,61302968,
