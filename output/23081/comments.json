    "body": "Thanks. However aside from the fact that this should be opened in the [gui repo](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui), I'm not sure this is necessarily an improvement. We could massage this text in all sorts of ways. Also, if you are going to make commits for this project, I'd suggest reading through the developer notes and contributing.md. I'm going to close this PR for now.",
