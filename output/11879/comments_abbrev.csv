MarcoFalke,2017-12-13T23:00:12Z,"> no risk or downside to merging this PR\n\nI disagree. There might be no risk, but there is a downside. One tool for testing changes is to break the software (or test) on purpose and see if the test (or software), i.e. the ""counterpart"", fails. Merging the pull request now would make it infeasible to use this approach for testing on univalue objects.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11879#issuecomment-351552858,351552858,
