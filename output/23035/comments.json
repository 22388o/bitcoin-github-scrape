    "body": "Concept ACK, approach NACK. I don't think it makes sense to add this addrman-specific data into the `CAddress` class, which is used by many different components.\r\n\r\n> Two ways to expose them are (1) move them from CAddrInfo to CAddress or (2) use CAddrInfo instead of CAddress for the GetAddr_(), GetAddr() and GetAddresses() functions and callers.\r\n\r\nI don't think we want to do (2) either. In general, we're trying to encapsulate addrman more. `CAddrInfo` is an addrman implementation-specific class, so ideally it wouldn't be exposed at all in the header. That's done in #22950, which introduces a very clear compilation firewall between implementation and public interface.\r\n\r\nI think the best way to do this is update `CAddrMan::GetAddr()` to return a vector of tuples, `std::vector<std::tuple<CAddress, /* tried */ bool, /* refcount*/ int>>`, similar to how `Select()` is updated to return a `std::pair<>` in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22950/files#diff-164bd9e2e30f54d0a79eb7cc372309e2f2155edc6c3f051290ab078f03f6a771R89. That means that the public method is returning only what the caller needs, minimizing the coupling between implementation and client code.",

    "body": "I'm uncertain about this concept (adding table & refcount in `getnodeaddresses`), I don't currently have a strong opinion, so am just sharing some thoughts & tradeoffs:\r\n- From the POV of a user, I can see how this additional information could be interesting. Since the `getnodeaddresses` endpoint is already essentially for super users or clients utilizing addrman, it seems reasonable to add this implementation-specific information.\r\n- For functional tests, I don't think it makes sense to regularly test the internal storage mechanism of addrman. That seems better suited for unit tests. So, I'm not sure this is adding much value. If the root issue is expectations around what is on new vs tried because of collisions, adding a way to construct a deterministic addrman (eg. as suggested in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22831#discussion_r710894714) seems like a more robust solution.\r\n- For the unit tests, simply returning the address table & multiplicity if on new seems insufficient to support the current tests with a smaller interface, because several of the tests require the specific bucket & position of the address.\r\n- For the fuzz tests, specifically `addrman_serdeser`, this more informational endpoint could potentially be used to replace the `operator==()` functionality. That would be nice to simplify the interface, but reduce the thoroughness of the check, and require multiplicity + collisions to detect any inconsistencies in bucket hashing logic. Since the majority of the time in the fuzz test is spent filling an addrman, I think more thorough checks would be preferable. \r\n\r\nSo overall, I think the biggest benefit to this added functionality would be for superusers or clients using the RPC interface to observe or build on addrman. Additionally, there seems to be some marginal benefit for the functional tests. I am uncertain if these benefits outweigh the maintenance costs of the code.\r\n\r\nMany thanks to @mzumsande for collaborating to form these thoughts :) ",

Along with the other feedback here, it may be a good idea for `getnodeaddresses` to have its own GetAddr-like function that is separate from the one used by internal components.",
