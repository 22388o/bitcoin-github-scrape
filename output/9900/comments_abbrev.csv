TheBlueMatt,2017-03-02T00:05:02Z,"I'd be surprised if you are spending a significant amount of CPU/bandwidth on such nodes. This patch doesn't stop them from connecting (only disconnects directly thereafter), so it won't lower the CPU cost much, either. Do you have any idea what the nodes are who are doing this? I have never seen this except for one specific case of a misconfigured testnet node.\n\nOn March 1, 2017 4:33:11 PM EST,",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9900#issuecomment-283512938,283512938,

Rav3nPL,2017-03-02T07:42:08Z,"As for now those ""bad altcions"" nodes keep our daemon busy for no reason - it have to accept connection, receive some handshake data and parse response. Then daemon decide to drop connection, but do nothing more, so node is back in few seconds trying again, again, again. \nBecause they are on totally different blockchain if we allow to connect there can be a lot more resources wasted network-wide",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9900#issuecomment-283579975,283579975,

laanwj,2017-03-03T14:23:27Z,Banning is supposed to be used when nodes waste resources. Sending invalid/incomprehensible data just warrants a disconnect.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9900#issuecomment-283965609,283965609,
pstratem,2017-03-04T01:41:49Z,Possibly the solution here is to change the log level for connections from nodes which produce gibberish?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9900#issuecomment-284116154,284116154,
gmaxwell,2017-03-04T19:41:48Z,"Bluematt's comments were my initial thought.
