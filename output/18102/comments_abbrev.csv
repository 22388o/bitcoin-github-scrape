theStack,2020-02-09 22:04:38,"@yancyribbens: It seems that your problem is caused by omitting any path name on executing `test_bitcoin`, which will search in `$PATH` for the binary, which then most likely is the installed one. To execute unit tests from your local build, either use `make check` or `src/test/test_bitcoin` (as described in `src/test/README.md`).",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18102#issuecomment-583899234,583899234,
yancyribbens,2020-02-10 08:51:50,@theStack thanks that works.  Maybe it would be helpful to add the local path prefix under the section `Running individual tests` since running the system installed binary isn't useful here.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18102#issuecomment-584017104,584017104,
fanquake,2020-02-20 12:36:21,"Adding the prefix here seems fine, as we use it throughout the rest of the file. You just need to fix the commit message. i.e ` doc: add src/test/ prefix to test_bitcoin in test README `.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18102#issuecomment-588999832,588999832,
