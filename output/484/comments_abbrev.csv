gavinandresen,2011-09-02T13:02:52Z,"I'm testing, and failing to connect.\n\nI think the code needs to randomize the order in which it trys to connect to seed nodes-- it is always picking the first one on the list to try.\n\nAnd if the connection to that node fails, it either takes a very long time to try another or isn't trying another at all...\n\nI'm testing by removing the addr.dat file and running -nodnsseed -noirc\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/484#issuecomment-1978753,1978753,
gavinandresen,2011-09-02T15:51:26Z,New seed nodes are working nicely after I fixed the code to randomize which one to connect to.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/484#issuecomment-1980284,1980284,
nanotube,2011-09-02T16:32:03Z,"great. I guess we were unfortunate enough that the first node or two in the new list happened to go down or fill up sometime between me testing it and including it in the list, and you testing this :) (or fortunate, as the case may be, since it encouraged you to improve the code with the randomization bit :) ).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/484#issuecomment-1980661,1980661,
