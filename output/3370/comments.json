My intuition says that as long as you select one of the valid highest-pow chains, and there is no way to make a node switch to an equal-work chain when it already has one, we should always converge - but perhaps we need to think harder about that.\n\nIn any case, I like the rule \"the earliest seen of all highest-pow valid chains\". Perhaps this needs to be discussed outside of this pullreq though.\n",

    "body": "@laanwj I'm pretty sure it's possible to recreate the old behavior in a headers-first compatible implementation, but I'd rather not. I like having a clear rule about what the intended behavior is, and have that implemented.\n\nAfter having thought a bit about this, this is a case where the old and new implementation differ, IIRC:\n- The following setup exists: A->B and A->C. Now an orphan E is announced (with unknown parent D that builds on B), D is requested, but in the mean time block F (building on C) arrives. We switch to chain A->C->F in any case, but if now D arrives, and E turns out to be invalid, the old implementation would remain on A->C->F, while the new implementation will switch to A->B->D as D arrived before F.\n  I doubt this is the simplest scenario to trigger a difference, and it would surprise me if that was what PullTester observes.\n\nI still like the \"the earliest received of all valid maximal-PoW chains\" rule, as it's easy to implement and stateless. The current rules depend on what the current best chain is.\n",

    "body": "Yes, actually I believe this (and similar cases) are what pull tester is tickling. The latest run tickles a few cases:\n- b8 is an invalid block built on an equal-work fork (b7). pull-tester expects to stay on b6 (the previous best chain), but this pull appears to switch to b7.\n- b11 is the same case with b11 being invalid in a different way (too much fee vs double-spend).\n- b13/b14 is:\n\n```\n        //     genesis -> b1 (0) -> b2 (1) -> b5 (2) -> b6  (3)\n        //                                          \\-> b12 (3) -> b13 (4) -> b14 (5)\n        //                                              (b12 added last)\n```\n\nOnly b14 is invalid so pull tester expects to select b13 but this pull differs somehow (its not entirely clear from the logs what the difference is, and this one is very likely to be pull-tester responding incorrectly to getblocks/getheaders, confusing the download process to be confused)\n",
