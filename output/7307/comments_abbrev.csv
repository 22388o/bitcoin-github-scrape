laanwj,2016-01-07T11:30:57Z,"Concept ACK. It's good that 'modules' can register their own RPC calls. The wallet is a prime example of this, but there may be more in the future.\n\nSome nits:\n- `walletRegisterRPCCommands` should not be on CWallet. CWallet is the class that implements the wallet not its RPC interface. A better place is in `rpcwallet.cpp`.\n- `walletRegisterRPCCommands` implementation should not be in the heade",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7307#issuecomment-169635852,169635852,
jonasschnelli,2016-01-07T12:20:31Z,"Agreed with and fixed @laanwj points/nits.\n\n> Having a data structure initialization in a header file means it can only be included in one place, otherwise there will be duplicate definition errors.\n\nJust curios: wouldn't this be avoided because of the headers preprocessor marcos (like `#ifndef BITCOIN_WALLET_RPCWALLET_H`)\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7307#issuecomment-169646198,169646198,

jgarzik,2016-01-07T14:34:56Z,ut ACK\n\nNote - The need to define functions in rpcwallet.h is greatly diminished.  The rpcwallet.cpp externs could be removed from rpcwallet.h right now.  The only reference is the in-rpcwallet call table.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7307#issuecomment-169680636,169680636,
