petertodd,2015-11-20T21:55:25Z,"Nit: I think it'd make more sense if FindFilesToPrune() took a params object, as the PruneAfterHeight feels like an implementation specific detail that FlushStateToDisk() doesn't need to know about.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7053#discussion_r45523660,45523660,src/main.cpp

petertodd,2015-11-22T21:20:02Z,"Right now it is, but my point is the fact that it is is an implementation detail that may change in the future!\n\nBut anyway, that's a pretty minor nit.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7053#discussion_r45564692,45564692,src/main.cpp
jtimon,2015-11-23T11:12:10Z,"I'm not sure it was a good idea to put nPruneAfterHeight in CChainParams in the first place. In any case, for functions that only take one thing from CChainParams (not Consensus::Params) I prefer to use the single thing directly instead of the full CChainParams, and if FlushStateToDisk ever needs more things from CChainParams, he can change the function prototype himself.
