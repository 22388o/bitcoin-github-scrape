    "body": "It seems to me that it would make more sense to separate p2p-layer behaviors that we want to test from consensus-layer behaviors that we want to test -- otherwise there's a risk that changes to one might break our tests for another.\r\n\r\nI was surprised, when reviewing this just now, that the behavior of `send_blocks_and_test` when `request_block=False` is to not send the block at all, rather than force delivery of the block whether or not the peer requested it.  Anyway I think we should just get rid of the `request_block` parameter altogether and test what happens if the block were delivered outright (which is the case that I think we care about in all the places we currently pass in False); ideally we'd do that both via p2p and via RPC's `submitblock`.\r\n\r\nSeparately, we should write a test that covers what we want the p2p behavior to be when various kinds of valid and invalid block headers are received.  It'd be great if changing p2p behavior with respect to block download meant only changing p2p-related tests, and not worrying about the downstream effects of changes like that on our consensus tests.\r\n\r\nAnyway, this PR is currently a strict improvement as the existing code is buggy, so utACK if you'd like to leave this as-is and leave discussion of the broader point for a future PR.",
