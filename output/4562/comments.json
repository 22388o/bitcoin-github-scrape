    "body": "No we didn't and probably the gains won't be very big.\nThis came up in a conversation when I was pointing out that if we knew the sighash before calling EvalScript, the serialization could be done before and only once per script evaluation (instead of once per CheckSig). EvalScript receives a nHashType parameter but it's only used for checking it is the same as the ones contained at the end of the signatures. As shown in #4555, it is almost always called with a 0 which makes CheckSig ignore the check and just use what's contained at the end of the signature.\nI'm still struggling to understand why there can be different sighashes for the same script/output and why they're are placed after the signatures instead of somewhere else. Sipa's \"ask Satoshi\" it's not a satisfactory answer to me... \n\nI'm also still thinking what good be a way to benchmark this...\n",

It could be a field on each input, for example:\n\n```\nif (input.nSighash == SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY)\n```\n\nProbably is too late to change that, but I would like to understand if there was a motivation I'm missing  or it was just a design mistake.\n",

No one is talking about Bitcoin's scalability problems, just about small improvements you could have if you could completely redesign the protocol (without hurting functionality), that was my thought exercise, nothing else. \nAnyway, enough of polluting the thread with what-ifs, my apologies.\n",
