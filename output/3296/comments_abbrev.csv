gmaxwell,2013-11-26T09:28:03Z,"pfrom->strSubVer is read in from the network without any sanitation, this change appears that it would allow log entry emulation. It should be changed to prevent that (I think I'd suggested urlcoding the strings elsewhere where we were going to log untrusted strings from network).\n\nAck the mempool peer logging, since its off by default in any case.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3296#issuecomment-29277996,29277996,
mikehearn,2013-11-26T12:38:44Z,"@gmaxwell Good catch. It was being put into RPC responses too, though I guess JSON-SPIRIT should escape things appropriately. I introduced a cleanSubVer field that's been run through SanitizeString and changed logging and RPC responses to use that one.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3296#issuecomment-29288860,29288860,
