Wallet names are already part of the RPC interface, and they must be unique, and they are already a familiar concept to callers. No need to introduce a new concept that doesn't have a good use-case and adds extra code, and then expose it externally through confusing warnings and pruning behavior.\r\n\r\nI added the first use of BDB fileids in #11429 to avoid data corruption when multiple wallets with the same fileid are loaded into the same environment.

    "body": "> What did you have in mind?\r\n\r\nJust basic file management. Maybe I want to make a bunch of wallets with the same password and import different keys into them. Maybe I want some wallets with the same keys. Maybe I want to set up a few wallets together on one machine and them copy them to different machines, and sometimes use them on the same machine again. Nothing impossible to work around, but it's nice for wallets to behave like normal data files and be copyable, and I don't think code should go out of its way to make wallet data more complicated or harder to manage.\r\n\r\n> This is always broken behaviour, and has never been supported...\r\n\r\nIt works fine, and I'm not saying go out of the way to add support. I'm saying don't go out of the way to remove support.\r\n\r\n> Wallet names are not unique and can be changed.\r\n\r\nIt's exhausting to discuss things like this with you Luke!

This means have it in CWallet, have a way to fetch it from CWallet, have the record in `walletdb.cpp` and writers for it in `WalletBatch`.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, this PR is a massive layer violation. While I accept that we will have a layer violation here because of BDB (although I would prefer we don't use the BDB id as a wallet id, @luke-jr insists that we must), the layer violation should be limited to just BDB. It should not be put somewhere that we plan on supporting for a long time. Put the layer violation in the module that's slated for removal.\r\n\r\nThe wallet id should be at the wallet level, not the db level. The only thing that belongs in the db level is writing the BDB unique id as a wallet id record. Having SQLite write a newly generated record is not the correct way to implement a wallet id.\r\n\r\n#20205 does this correctly.",

There should be a GUI wallet rename feature and `renamewallet` API anyway to rename wallets explicitly and update external wallet references. Not just the ones in prune locks, but also references in the settings file, and references in memory if renaming is allowed without unloading and reloading. Any case it would be best to discuss this directly in the relevant issues.\r\n\r\n",
