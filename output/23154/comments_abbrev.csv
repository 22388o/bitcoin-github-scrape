To be really finicky maybe a new standalone doc for any project should only be merged once the project is completed (fully merged) and functional.

michaelfolkson,2021-11-03 12:15:39,I think @MarcoFalke and @ryanofsky have some good points above on docs generally so added their comments to #20132. This doc and the docs generally are definitely a work in progress with lots of scope for improvement. I agree with this being merged though as James' first attempt at a doc for Assume UTXO as there are no inaccuracies or clear sources of confusion (as far as I can tell) and follow up,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23154#issuecomment-958974768,958974768,
