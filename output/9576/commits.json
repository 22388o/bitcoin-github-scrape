      "message": "[wallet] Remove redundant initialization\n\nPrior to this commit pindexRescan was initialized to a chainActive.Tip().\nHowever, the value of pindexRescan set at time of initialization was never\nread before pindexRescan was being set to either chainActive.Genesis()\n(case 1), FindForkInGlobalIndex(chainActive, locator) (case 2) or\nchainActive.Genesis() (case 3). Thus, the initialization was redundant.\n\nThis commit a.) removes the redundant initialization and b.) simplifies\nthis logic so that pindexRescan is initialized to chainActive.Genesis()\n(case 1 and 3), and set to FindForkInGlobalIndex(chainActive, locator)\n(case 2) as needed.",
