laanwj,2015-06-12T10:45:57Z,"@paveljanik Yea - good catch, but I'm ok with that. This is effectively a way of saying that you don't acknowledge that the `alert` message is part of the P2P protocol. Also remember that ""unknown message"" will only appear with `-debug=net`.\n(but it's easy enough to avoid if people prefer that...)\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6274#issuecomment-111445913,111445913,

Diapolo,2015-06-12T10:14:32Z,Nit: The check for fAlerts would be faster I guess? Why not place switch the checks? If we are talking about a DoS situation perhaps that could make things less ressource hungry?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6274#discussion_r32304796,32304796,src/main.cpp
