It doesn't matter here, but if there's no need to introduce a dependency on something so bitcoin-specific in general RPC protocol code that may be better. Hex encoding on the other hand is trivial and readily available.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8858#issuecomment-250957819,250957819,
