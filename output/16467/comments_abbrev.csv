Relaxo143,2019-07-28 10:46:56,Maybe a policy could be implemented so that nodes rebroadcast even transactions which are already in their mempools for let's say up to 10 times. That will prevent privacy leakages and also limit abuse. After the node hears the tx for the eleventh time it will no longer resend it.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16467#issuecomment-515752137,515752137,
