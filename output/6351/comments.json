    "body": "So, @mruddy brought up two issues that are really the same as with the BIP66 tests: out of date copyright headers and TODO items that are out of date. The latter issue is pretty simple: bipdersig-p2p.py covers the missing test cases marked as \"TODO\" in bipdersig.py\n\nI wanted to show I've replicated the exact same testing procedure done on BIP66 given that the code changes itself are also replicated exactly; if I'm going to fix these two nits I think it makes sense to fix them in the BIP66 tests first, in a separate commit that'll go first in this pull-req, so the two sets of tests can still be diffed directly to show exact equivalence. Makes sense?\n\n@mruddy Yup, I'll add release notes later, and similarly, will look at what changing the NOP2 name will entail later. Right now I'm focused on making the minimal possible change that gets the job done so backporting the changes to v0.10.x (and probably v0.11.x) will be easy and clearly correct. v0.12.x can do the more invasive stuff of changing opcode names and what-not.\n",

    "body": "@petertodd I see what you're saying about trying to keep the diff compares as close and easy as possible. But, the diffs on the tests are necessarily going to be somewhat different. I wouldn't make updated BIP66 test cases part of this change set. My choice would be to make the minor cleanups to these tests so that they are cleaner when reviewed in isolation (and in the future, not within the context of how this change set compares to that of BIP66). I can see how line-only diffs vs some block or structural diffs might have some value to reduce dissonance though. So, however you want to handle it is OK with me.\n\nAbout the decode name update, I agree, leave that until later. I was just saying that if you mention the upcoming change in the notes now, then it makes actually pushing it through later, easier. It's more of a busy work change anyways, so leave it for someone newer to the project than yourself to work on. It's good for someone newer to work on because of how it may affect various parts of the code base.\n",

Also, @gavinandresen confirmed w/ other devs recently that they'll add CLTV support to XT.\n\nIn terms of deployment, this IsSuperMajority() deployment mechanism is well tested and works, and there's no compatibility issue with it and a future nVersion bits deployment. (or subsequent IsSuperMajority() soft-forks) The _only_ issue is if CLTV fails to gain acceptance, which right now I think is very unlikely.\n\nSo, ACK merge to get CLTV deployment on-track and in-progess.\n",

The optics, communication difficulties, and extra work of pulling off multiple lock-time related soft-forks are not being properly considered.\n\n#6312 was proposed three months ago and has seen a good deal of review. The much simpler and less controversial #6564 and #6566 have been open for a month. Together these constitute a complete upgrade to the behavior of lock-time in bitcoin. Rolling out CLTV first will cause head-aches. In particular #6566 changes how lock-time validity is determined. Having to go back and fix infrastructure written against the current behavior if/when #6566 is rolled out will be a giant waste of everyone's time.\n\nThere was a plan discussed on the mailing list, this very issue, and the IRC development meeting a week ago to get reviews of the above mentioned PR's and do a point release just prior to 0.12. What happened to that plan?\n",

I know softforks/hardforks don't need to coincide with major releases, but still, I don't see the problem with rolling the 2 changes in 2 different softforks if necessary.\nYou mention that #6566 changes how lock time validity is determined.

It checks that the nlocktime field in the transaction agrees with the value on the stack, if it does-- it does nothing. If it does not, it terminates execution. It has no clue about the height of the blockchain, and if it did it would make script execution no long a pure function of the transaction, violate the layering between transactions and the blockchain, make it possible for a script to become invalid that was valid before, etc.\n",
