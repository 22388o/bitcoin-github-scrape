MarcoFalke,2019-11-14 15:54:59,"I wasn't sure if @jamesob was using it for some projects, but I interpret the reply as ""no"", so going to remove the `assert_memory_usage_stable` as well.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17469#issuecomment-553950801,553950801,
jamesob,2019-11-14 15:55:41,"FWIW I think this is a totally appropriate assertion for a functional test, since it's the highest-level suite of tests we have, and ensuring sane memory use is a feature of the system, but if we can't do it reliably across platform then we should either not do it on unreliable platforms or remove it entirely. My preference would be for the former, but if other people don't want to maintain this t",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17469#issuecomment-553951095,553951095,
laanwj,2019-11-14 16:00:52,"In theory I agree, in practice a modern OS is so complex with so much going on in the background, that deterministically testing memory use seems to be impossible. It's the same as for timing tests. Sure, this can be done in a controlled environment, but not Travis and definitely not with parallelism of many.\n(Edit: it'd probably work better with some LD_PRELOAD library that tracked malloc/free ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17469#issuecomment-553953593,553953593,
MarcoFalke,2019-11-14 16:03:22,"I think the check itself is useful, but the limitations of the functional test framework make it almost useless in practice. The current status of this tests is: Running for twelve months, not a single reproducible failure.\n\nI think this can be implemented as a fuzz test, making it more powerful, useful and easier to debug in case of failure.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17469#issuecomment-553954770,553954770,
