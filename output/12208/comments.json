But not the end of the world. Mixing @flack's, @makomk's and your own suggestion:\r\n\r\n> The generated address begins with bc1 and lowers your fees when you spend it (BIP173).

    "body": "> goal is to push native segwit addresses forward\r\n\r\nHaving this checkbox already goes a long way in encouraging adoption. Firstly it lets normal (non-RPC) users actually use it. Secondly it raises the bar for other wallets / services and gives them some confidence they're not wasting engineering time. See e.g. [this tweet from Kraken](https://twitter.com/krakensupport/status/949596199006306304).\r\n\r\nLike RBF, I think this needs to happen in two phases: first we clearly offer it to the user and then - assuming no unexpected problems arise and the rest of the industry actually adopts it - we make it the default.\r\n\r\nMaking it the default now would lead to confusion, especially from users who don't even notice the checkbox, suddenly see a different address format and think something is wrong with their wallet. I forgot the word for \"UX should not change as fast as technology allows, but should respect human ability to adapt to these changes\", but it's similar to how Apple used [Skeuomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeuomorph) on their early iPhones but switched to more abstract representations (and relied more on gestures) once people became familiar with smart phones in general.",

    "body": "FWIW, my view on deployment is that even having the checkbox is rushing things... but not unacceptably. I think initially software should be made able to send to these addresses, then later made able to receive them.  Having the checkbox allows faster usage, but at a cost of creating a small amount of confusion due to having a somewhat complicated option that often (esp initially) won't work.  I think it's a good trade-off, and I'm already using BC1 addresses (as I assume many other advanced users will)-- but it's not a free decision either.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "@luke-jr You make a fair point, especially since English has been changing due to acronyms being used in texting on cellular phones (e.g., \"afaik\" is obviously easier to type than \"a.f.a.i.k.\"), and so I don't think that you're wrong.  My thinking was that in many circles \"aka,\" (without the periods) is still regarded as slang, leaving \"a.k.a.,\" (with the periods) as being the more traditional usage, but of course English is evolving (as it always has).\r\n\r\nAlso, for people who are not fluent in English, \"aka\" has the potential to be confusing because it looks like a word, whereas \"a.k.a.\" will be much more easily understood as an acronym.\r\n\r\nMy personal preference is to favour the English style that lends itself more to academia and English writing tradition because from my perspective it gives the Bitcoin software, as a whole, a more professionally-polished appearance, which I think is ultimately beneficial to this project overall.  But this is also peer-review, and what I think isn't necessarily correct either.",
