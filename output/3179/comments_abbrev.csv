laanwj,2013-10-28T17:42:55Z,I'm not sure that I understand -- why not simply fail if a bitcoin URI contains an invalid address or the payment request cannot be read?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3179#issuecomment-27236069,27236069,

Diapolo,2013-10-30T08:32:26Z,"@gavinandresen @laanwj See, the problem is, if I supply an invalid address in an URI, but have a running Bitcoin-Qt instance a new one is started, which won't work, because there is one running already ^^. This patch tries to deliver the faulty bitcoin: URI and THEN displays a nice warning message.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3179#issuecomment-27372314,27372314,

Diapolo,2013-10-30T10:45:29Z,"@laanwj Tell me, is it easier/better UX wise to (try to) send an invalid URI to a running server and get a nice error message or show a saved error that the URI could not be parsed (via QMessageBox in init.cpp) and then another error, which tells that you already have a running instance, because when ipcSendCommandLine() fails we try to start a new instance (which also is not recommended to let an",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3179#issuecomment-27379278,27379278,
laanwj,2013-10-30T11:00:31Z,"Eh, I just checked bitcoin.cpp and PaymentServer::ipcSendCommandLine is called _after_ the GUI initialization. The QApplication object is created and translations are loaded, which is far enough along to show a dialog box and exit. What's the problem?\nThere's no need to let it come as far as creating an actual instance. Exit before the second error.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3179#issuecomment-27380101,27380101,

Diapolo,2013-10-30T13:56:12Z,"Can we exchange a few more thoughts on this Please? Take another look at `ipcSendCommandLine()`.\n\nCurrently we have 2 checks for normal URIs that can fail `GUIUtil::parseBitcoinURI()` and `CBitcoinAddress::IsValid()`. Both of which are used _just_ to detect the active network (for sending the received URI to the TCP local sever), we currently don't use them to reject invalid URIs or show any mes",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3179#issuecomment-27390617,27390617,
laanwj,2013-10-30T14:20:26Z,"I understand what you mean but this is a weird edge case anyway:  ideally, users should not encounter malformed URIs and payment requests. We shouldn't be spending this much time on it. The only thing that matters here security, and clear feedback that something is wrong.
