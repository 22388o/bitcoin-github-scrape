jonasschnelli,2017-12-20T18:30:09Z,"Concept ACK... the only bothering thing is, that regtest mode gets quite useless without passing in a -fallbackfee... and for that reason #11882 (removes default fallbackfee on mainnet only) may make more sense.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11918#issuecomment-353144907,353144907,
MarcoFalke,2017-12-20T18:38:02Z,"My understanding is that regtest mode becomes more and more useless as the number of differences to mainnet increase. If we special case that on mainnet, there'd be no way to test other than running a mainnet node.\n\nEspecially since we plan to rework the gui based on the fallback settings, it is important to be able to test in a non-mainnet setting.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11918#issuecomment-353146785,353146785,

MarcoFalke,2017-12-20T20:24:14Z,"They could specify it in their bitcoin.conf, assuming that it exists. If no bitcoin.conf exists, the only way I see is by passing it in on the command line.\n\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11918#issuecomment-353173021,353173021,
