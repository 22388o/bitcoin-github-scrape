laanwj,2015-09-17T16:38:26Z,"I'd say ""meh"".\n\nThere's an infinite number of these pulls that could be created , that make small changes to the log format here and there, perturbing a line here and there.\n\nBut remember that the log is just a debug log. Its format is not meant to be standardized or machine parseable. To be concise: it is _not_ a well-defined external interface. You can't really speak of convention.\n\nMaybe ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6674#issuecomment-141143018,141143018,
TheBlueMatt,2015-09-17T16:44:25Z,"I'm generally not a fan of changing debug log format just to change it. It's not designed to be machine parsable, and changing it breaks any existing parsers or people trying to grep old logs across format changes (my debug.log is a few months old and a few hundred gb, which offers useful ability to grep for interesting things).\n\nOn September 17, 2015 12:38:35 PM EDT, ""Wladimir J. van der Laan"" ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6674#issuecomment-141144402,141144402,
shea256,2015-09-17T17:51:45Z,"@laanwj My goal with this PR was to glean a standard as best as I could. I noticed that there were certain things that were common across the various log messages, and so I went with whatever patterns were found there.\n\nI do think that there should be a convention and I would be happy to help develop one. As you can see, I started taking notes on conventions above.\n\nI understand that it's _jus",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6674#issuecomment-141165384,141165384,
