    "body": "@laanwj My goal with this PR was to glean a standard as best as I could. I noticed that there were certain things that were common across the various log messages, and so I went with whatever patterns were found there.\n\nI do think that there should be a convention and I would be happy to help develop one. As you can see, I started taking notes on conventions above.\n\nI understand that it's _just_ a debug log but I actually think it is just another thing that can make developers' lives happy when they have to parse through the logs. When logs are more human readable this does actually make it simpler to parse through things. When one has to figure out what this or that means, that results in that much more time for a developer to address issues and that much more value lost in terms of application value or contributions back to bitcoin core.\n\nFurther, I think this also is an issue of professionalism for a piece of software that should be up there with the most professional ones, given it's societal importance.\n\n\"Paint the back of the fence... because you'll know.\"\n\n@paveljanik the reason I went with two spaces is that seemed to be the favored method and if you only use one space, there's not a clear separation between properties, unless of course you use some other delineator like commas, which I would also support (that's probably even cleaner).\n\n@TheBlueMatt The point here was not to change the debug log format just to change it. I was motivated to submit this PR after spending time going through the logs and realizing how they should have been much easier to parse. You all are much more familiar with what all of the log messages are for, but I'd put yourselves in the position of a developer working with bitcoind early on.\n",

    "body": "> \"Paint the back of the fence... because you'll know.\"\n\nI'm not deeply against it, just a bit afraid that if this is done uncoordinated it will open the floodgates to zillions of pull requests that will just change a logging line here and there. This makes history hard to read, and may interfere with more important changes.\n\nWe've seen this before with proposals to e.g. sort the include files at the top of implementation files. Its nice if it is sticked to consistently, but if not it gives a lot of extra traffic for questionable gain.\n\nAs it is there's still plenty of painting at the front of the fence that needs to be done.\n\nEdit: so to be concrete: first add a document to doc/XXX, make people agree on the new convention for log messages (if there is interest in it), and only then apply it.\n",
