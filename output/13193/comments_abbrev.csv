promag,2018-05-15T13:08:47Z,"> @promag Is setAlreadyIncluded.count(childHash) the most common case? And, can its result be affected by the call to setChildren.insert(childIter).second?\n\n@murrayn the idea is to avoid the `childIter = mapTx.find` call, which `setChildren.insert(childIter)` depends on.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13193#issuecomment-389160174,389160174,

andreip,2018-05-09T05:44:52Z,"one effect of adding this here would be that `setChildren.insert` won't be called for those that are skipped here anymore, but since `setChildren` is locally declared and only used once below, it looks fine.\n\nThis change lgtm since it's only adding a check to be called earlier to avoid an unnecessary `mapTx.find()` call and the rest of the boolean looks the same.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13193#discussion_r186935709,186935709,src/txmempool.cpp
