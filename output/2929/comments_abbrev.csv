jgarzik,2013-08-25T02:30:41Z,ACK the code change... what is the use case?   How is this useful?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2929#issuecomment-23220619,23220619,

In my example, I was having a tough time because I couldn't tell if my external IP address was being seen correctly by the outside world.

Krellan,2013-09-07T21:00:42Z,"Thanks for the thought.  I actually hide the `addrlocal` field from the output entirely, in the getpeerinfo handler, if it's blank.  If local address is not known yet, the output is unchanged from upstream.\n\nThought about adding the field anyway but leaving it as an empty string, but that just added bloat to the output.  Using `n/a` instead introduces a magic constant string that conveys no more",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2929#discussion_r6225802,6225802,src/net.cpp
