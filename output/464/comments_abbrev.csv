TheBlueMatt,2011-08-25T19:13:13Z,"It would be nice to get a confirmation that the results here are deterministic...IIRC devrandom said that there are a few bytes changing in the final nsis exe, but everything else should be stable (including the boost and wx results).  Im going to see if I can work on the nsis exe, but Ill leave this open because if it doesnt happen before 0.4 is ready to go, its fine by me.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/464#issuecomment-1902959,1902959,
