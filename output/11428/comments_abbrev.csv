meshcollider,2017-10-01T02:31:25Z,"Agree with Marco, and it sounds a little weird, I'd prefer something like `Allow transaction to be replaced by one with a higher fee later on (BIP 125)`\n\nAlso, in your PR it's better to write `Fixes #11344` rather than `see`, because then GitHub automatically closes the issue and links to this PR",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11428#issuecomment-333348955,333348955,
