ken2812221,2018-09-12T03:26:54Z,`__GNUC__` is also defined by clang. Don't have to check `__clang__`,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14194#discussion_r216886892,216886892,src/attributes.h
arvidn,2018-09-17T14:11:36Z,"it seems odd that this would be necessary in a declaration. instead of adding the attribute here, you could just remove the name of the parameter (just like for the second parameter). neither are used in the declaration anyway.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14194#discussion_r218084083,218084083,src/rpc/blockchain.h
arvidn,2018-09-17T14:12:41Z,`ibd` seems to *always* be unused here. I think a better approach is to just remove the argument name,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14194#discussion_r218084492,218084492,src/rpc/blockchain.cpp
arvidn,2018-09-17T14:13:47Z,`title` appears to be unused as well. I think a better approach is to remove the parameter name.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14194#discussion_r218084904,218084904,src/qt/transactiontablemodel.cpp
