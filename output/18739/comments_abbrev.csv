kiminuo,2020-04-22 21:00:51,"Good job. Concept ACK\n\n(bikeshedding: One thing I've just noticed is that commands are prefixed with `$`. I find it nice from documentation POV. Although it may be impractical when somebody wants to copy the commands and run them in a batch. Moreover, mostly it looks like other documents in `doc` folder do not follow this convention - there are no `$` prefixes for command listings.)",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18739#issuecomment-618038129,618038129,
