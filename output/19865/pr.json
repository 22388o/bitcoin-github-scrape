  "body": "**This PR is a simple 3-line scripted diff followed by a documentation cleanup.** The scripted diff does three things:\r\n\r\n1. Deletes all existing `AssertLockHeld` calls. Since #19668, `AssertLockHeld` has had an `EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED` annotation which has guaranteed (though ongoing travis and cirrus CI builds since #19668 was merged) that these `AssertLockHeld` calls are redundant with `EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED` or `EXCLUSIVE_LOCK_FUNCTION` annotations already present in surrounding code, and specifically that:\r\n\r\n  - There is no way the assert calls can trigger any behavior at runtime.\r\n  - The assert calls provide no new thread safety information to the compiler.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Reverts `AssertLockHeld` implementation which got changed in #19668 to it's original pre-#19668 state. In #19668, `AssertLockHeld` was changed to have an `EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED` annotation instead of having an `ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_LOCK` annotation. As described above, having an `EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED` annotation on an assert statement is only useful as proof that the assert statement doesn't do anything or convey any new information. By contrast, having an `ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_LOCK` annotation on an assert statement can be an actually useful way of conveying to the compiler than a specific mutex is locked at a specific place in the code, when the compiler thread safety analysis can't determine that on its own (because of lost type information).\r\n\r\n3. Removes `LockAssertion` class, replacing all current uses with calls to `AssertLockHeld`. Ever since the `LockAssertion` class was first introduced in #14437 (as `LockAnnotation`), it has always been an inferior alternative to `AssertLockHeld` and not had a reason to exist. (#14437 was originally written before #13423 which added ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_LOCK annotation. It was justified when the code was first written, but no longer necessary by the time it was merged).\r\n\r\n**Motivation for this PR** is to get rid of confusion between different types of lock assertions and only keep one assertion: `AssertLockHeld` which goes back to the implementation it's had since #13423 was merged until #19668 was merged. After this PR, `AssertLockHeld` only needs to be used sparingly to augment compile-time thread safety annotations, which are a superior alternative to runtime checks for guaranteeing thread safety.\r\n\r\nPR is compared with alternatives in https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki/AssertLockHeld-PRs",
