    "body": "I agree with @ajtowns' [comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19668#discussion_r483287210):\r\n> We have three types of assertions related for locking:\r\n> \r\n>  - marking a function as `EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED` has a compile time check with clang that the caller has already obtained the lock\r\n> \r\n>  - declaring a `LockAssertion` instance overrides the clang compile time checks by saying that we've already somehow acquired the lock in a way that we can't prove via clang thread safety annotations. This is useful for lambda functions (which could be annotated) that are called from some generic dispatcher like `ForEach` (that can't be annotated).\r\n> \r\n>  - adding a call to `AssertLockHeld` does a runtime check if DEBUG_LOCKORDER is enabled. it's annotated with EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED so is redundant with the compile time checks, but the compile time checks aren't available outside of clang. it's automatically called from LockAssertion to ensure that the compile time checks aren't overridden incorrectly.\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> As a result:\r\n> \r\n>  - using AssertLockHeld everywhere remains fine, and no longer needlessly disables the compile time checks\r\n> \r\n>  - LockAssertion should only be used very rarely -- and in fact it's only used in net_processing in some ForEach/ForEachNode functions.\r\n\r\nProbably, `AssertLockHeld` deserves a better name, but its functionality and usage are ok.\r\n\r\n`EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED` is used in a header file. If a function definition is placed in a `*.cpp` file, using `AssertLockHeld` has the following benefits (besides a run time check):\r\n- it shows to a code reader the expected state of lock without referencing to a header file\r\n- it will warn about missed proper `EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED` annotation\r\n\r\n`AssertLockHeld` is a great tool to transit from `RecursiveMutex` to `Mutex` in a safe and proven manner. See: #19303, #19833, #19854.\r\n\r\nConcept NACK.",

    "body": "> While migrating from `RecursiveMutex` to `Mutex` how one could be confident in the fact that a mutex is actually locked without run time assertion?\r\n\r\nIf it is annotated with EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED, it seems you should be confident either that the mutex is actually locked or that LockAssertion was used earlier and would have triggered a runtime error where it was used. This PR isn't removing all runtime checks, just runtime checks redundant with compile time checks. AssertLockHeld is still available whenever you want to use it. It just returns to functioning like a normal runtime check, and not a strange compile time check enforcing the presence of a different compile time check. I can see how the strange check was useful during development of #19668, but it doesn't serve a purpose for thread safety going forward or help with future PRs.\r\n\r\nIf you want to make an argument for keeping all AssertLockHelds based on readability, that's fine, but then I think you should make a developer guideline saying that AssertLockHeld should be called first thing in any function annotated with EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED, and ideally have a linter to enforce this. Otherwise if the assert is only used in some places but not others, that is just adding confusion and inconsistency.",

    "body": "I think by default `./configure` will pick up gcc, which does not check lock annotations, so the current `AssertLockHeld` in master have a slight benefit of telling `./configure --enable-debug` devs (with gcc) who run the tests before creating a pull that something with their locks is wrong. Though, you correctly say that travis will compile with clang and fail if there is an inconsistency.\r\n\r\nThe redundant run time checks also serve as a insurance against bugs in clang.\r\n\r\nIdeally, they'd be inserted by the compiler whenever a function is annotated. Though, I don't see a way to do this in C++ without wrapping everything into more macros.

    "body": "We managed to misuse the compiler directives:\r\n\r\n* Our `AssertLockHeldInternal()` does a runtime check and would not return (aka `abort()`) if it fails. There is an attribute exactly for that: [ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_LOCK](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ThreadSafetyAnalysis.html#assert-capability-and-assert-shared-capability), but we don't use it. We use [EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ThreadSafetyAnalysis.html#requires-requires-shared), meant for something else. This is a misuse because `AssertLockHeldInternal()` does not do anything that requires holding the mutex (like reading variables protected by that mutex).\r\n\r\n* Our `LockAssertion::LockAssertion()` does the same as `AssertLockHeldInternal()`, but is tagged with [EXCLUSIVE_LOCK_FUNCTION](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ThreadSafetyAnalysis.html#acquire-acquire-shared-release-release-shared). A misuse because `LockAssertion()` does not acquire the mutex.\r\n\r\nI think we shouldn't be doing that for no matter what reason - misleading the compiler that we do one thing while we do another.\r\n\r\nThe OP in #19668 boils down to:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n 1 int x GUARDED_BY(cs_main);\r\n 2\r\n 3 void f() // not annotated with EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED(cs_main)\r\n 4 {\r\n 5     // AssertLockHeld was properly annotated with ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_LOCK() before #19668\r\n 6     AssertLockHeld(cs_main);\r\n 7\r\n 8     // no warning here that we access x without holding cs_main\r\n 9     x = 5;\r\n10 }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe compiler does not issue a compile-time warning for line 9 because it knows line 9 is unreachable at run-time if `cs_main` is not held - `AssertLockHeld()` from line 6 would not return in that case. IMO we shouldn't try to extort the compiler to produce a warning here. Mis-labeling `AssertLockHeld()` with `EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED()` only to ensure that `f()` has that attribute indeed looks like [adding an annotation to check for the presence of another annotation](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19865#issuecomment-687192979).\r\n\r\nI agree with @MarcoFalke that clang may have bugs and we better not have it as our sole protection. The thread safety analysis look a bit immature to me - for example the warnings produced [depend on the order in which attributes are defined](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19668#discussion_r467244459) (:-O). IMO [compile time checks are good and they are an addition to runtime checks, not a replacement](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19647#discussion_r468442853).\r\n\r\nWhat about going back to using the proper attributes? Tag `AssertLockHeldInternal()` with `ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_LOCK` when `DEBUG_LOCKORDER` is defined and no attributes otherwise (because it is a noop, don't fool the compiler) and remove the confusing `LockAssertion()`?",

We're trying to prevent buggy code, by in order of preference, (a) making it impossible to write (eg RAII so locks are free automatically); (b) making the compiler complain about it (eg thread safety annotations); (c) getting predictable safe errors at runtime rather than crashes, hangs or undefined behaviour that only happen randomly (eg lock order checks).\r\n\r\nIn our code, it's never correct to call `AssertLockHeld` (that is as it stands prior to this PR, not after `LockAssertion` is renamed) without already holding the lock, so the additional behaviours allowed by ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_LOCK aren't helpful, and make it easier to write buggy code.",
