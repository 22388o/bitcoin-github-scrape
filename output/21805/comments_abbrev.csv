No need to micro-optimize the bandwidth here.\n\nHi, no, actually the rounding causes it to send them more often as the number ""wobbles"" above and below the actual. Please see the attached log. The wobbling happens most often when the actual isn't moving much:- \n\n> 2021-04-30T05:5",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21805#issuecomment-830011998,830011998,
rebroad,2021-04-30 11:01:01,@MarcoFalke another fix would be to change the rounding function so that it only ever goes in one direction (rather than in two directions as it currently does).,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21805#issuecomment-830016772,830016772,

My point is that the round function is supposed to provide some privacy, and it's failing to do that, and it's also causing unnecessary traffic to be generated. Surely this is worth fixing for both these reasons.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21805#issuecomment-830211707,830211707,
