MarcoFalke,2018-07-14T16:40:33Z,"I believe it will automatically prompt you to use `-reindex` when needed while in pruning mode, so maybe no need to mention it here?\n\nThen, you could move the note about corruption to reindex. E.g. ""Rebuild chain state and block index from the blk*.dat files on disk *. Only needed when blocks on disk are corrupted.* """,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13662#discussion_r202519608,202519608,src/init.cpp
Sjors,2018-07-16T13:01:36Z,"I just sabotaged a pruned node by deleting the most recent `blkxxxxx.dat` file and then started bitcoind: `Please restart with -reindex or -reindex-chainstate to recover.`\n\nRestarting that pruned node with `-reindex-chainstate` will result in the same error message and won't tell the user they need to use `-reindex` instead. So I think it's better to mention pruned node in the help here.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13662#discussion_r202673093,202673093,src/init.cpp
