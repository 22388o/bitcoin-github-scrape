laanwj,2014-10-24T07:16:34Z,"For larger comment blocks I generally use JavaDoc style syntax, ie\n\n```\n/**\n * ... text ...\n */\n```\n\nI'd suggest to take a look at the doxygen documentation, especially http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/docblocks.html  on how to handle different cases.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5131#issuecomment-60352492,60352492,
laanwj,2014-10-24T09:13:34Z,Looks good to me now (tested w/ doxygen). ACK.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5131#issuecomment-60363053,60363053,

laanwj,2014-10-24T07:13:08Z,Any reason for changing comments _within_ functions? Does doxygen ever show them? `//!` is meant for descriptions of variables and properties AFAIK.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5131#discussion_r19325442,19325442,src/addrman.cpp
fanquake,2014-10-24T07:16:19Z,Comments within functions are shown by doxygen. Maybe /// would be better suited here?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5131#discussion_r19325514,19325514,src/addrman.cpp
laanwj,2014-10-24T07:20:33Z,"IMO it's better to just touch the API documenting comments for now, not those inside functions.\n(so those documenting the behaviour of functions, methods, classes, properties, etc...). I don't like to change every single comment in the program and require a specific comment style in functions.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5131#discussion_r19325619,19325619,src/addrman.cpp
fanquake,2014-10-24T07:52:45Z,Understood. Have pushed some changes.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5131#discussion_r19326577,19326577,src/addrman.cpp
