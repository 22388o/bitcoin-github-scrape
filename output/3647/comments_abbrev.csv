laanwj,2014-02-09T12:02:04Z,Looks good.\n\nI think it would be a good idea to split the GUI changes and the default change. The second is going to be a much harder sell. Personally I have the fee at 0 and I never have problems with transactions not getting mined.\n\nAlso: Seems to me that with floating fees (#3335 is preparation for it) and automatic fee estimation this setting isn't needed anymore?

cozz,2014-02-09T13:10:22Z,"Ok, I have reverted the default fee to zero. So only Qt changes now.

laanwj,2014-02-09T13:57:03Z,This makes the intro dialog very complicated. The way to do this would be to make it a multi-step wizard. But let's leave it at this for now.

Diapolo,2014-02-10T15:22:26Z,"I don't like the GUI changes, it looks like our other options in main are a sub-option of the fee setting now.
