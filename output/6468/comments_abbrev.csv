Diapolo,2015-07-24T06:01:43Z,Nit: Indentation and space after begin of comment.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6468#discussion_r35397389,35397389,src/base58.h
laanwj,2015-07-24T08:43:49Z,"I'm not sure that a fixed size check is a robust solution here (also, hardwiring 74 without any kind of constant) - doesn't the underlying decode function return an error if it couldn't decode?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6468#discussion_r35405138,35405138,src/base58.h
laanwj,2015-07-24T08:47:20Z,"OK I understand now why. ret.Decode takes a fixed-size object of 74 bytes.\nIn that case, please define a constant.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6468#discussion_r35405370,35405370,src/base58.h
jonasschnelli,2015-07-24T08:52:27Z,I didn't add a constant because fixing this is already covered in: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6215.\nThe Decode really expects 74 bytes (=hardcode check okay IMO)\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6468#discussion_r35405694,35405694,src/base58.h
jonasschnelli,2015-07-24T11:27:16Z,replaced the magic `74` with the template var `Size`\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6468#discussion_r35414416,35414416,src/base58.h
