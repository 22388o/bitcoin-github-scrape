razamobin,2017-08-10T22:08:29Z,"Hi, I'm new to the bitcoin source code, but I looked for redundant includes and got the same changeset as you. Also I was able to run unit tests and they all passed (although I guess Travis did this already?). Either way, looks good to me.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10574#issuecomment-321686787,321686787,
luke-jr,2017-09-02T04:03:22Z,Soft NACK. IMO it's better code quality to explicitly include everything needed in each source file using them.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10574#issuecomment-326720270,326720270,

sipa,2017-09-10T19:53:55Z,"@luke-jr @danra Then you should argue to change the guidelines in developer-notes.md:\n\n> Every .cpp and .h file should #include every header file it directly uses classes, functions or other definitions from, even if those headers are already included indirectly through other headers. **One exception is that a .cpp file does not need to re-include the includes already included in its correspon",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10574#issuecomment-328367333,328367333,
danra,2017-09-10T20:12:41Z,"@sipa Yes, I'm for changing this rule as it creates an unnecessary dependency of the implementation (.cpp) on the interface (.h). If the interface no longer uses some other include directly, but the implementation still uses that include directly, removing the include from the interface would require adding it to the implementation.\n\n(Note I'm not for having the implementation re-include *ever",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10574#issuecomment-328368586,328368586,

promag,2017-12-12T14:06:48Z,This is in the header BUT I believe it's not necessary there. IMO the first exercise should be to reduce to a minimal the includes in a header file.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10574#discussion_r156374116,156374116,src/qt/platformstyle.cpp
