gavinandresen,2014-02-12T20:15:33Z,"Can you fix all of the bash nits in qa/rpc-tests/wallet.sh, test with directories with spaces/etc. and submit a pull request for that?  I based the txnmall.sh code on wallet.sh, and, frankly, making it work if you've got a wacky directory hierarchy is not high on my TODO list.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3661#issuecomment-34912332,34912332,
