Before, they were passed in plain std::strings.\n- As I understand the conversions don't cause any extra allocation/deallocation of insecure memory, the conversions just pass memory around (and there's not _that_ many more) from one mlocked area to another, which is filled with zeros before freeing.  \n- By using a specific SecureString type it is signaled clearly that the data inside it should be handled with care.\n\nSigh, seems that sometimes you just want to disagree with things for the sake of disagreeing... do you really like arguing that much?\n",
