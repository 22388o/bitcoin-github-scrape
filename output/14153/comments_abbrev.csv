MarcoFalke,2018-09-05T19:04:30Z,I doubt that such an option even exists: I get `unknown command: getwork`,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14153#discussion_r215390778,215390778,doc/build-osx.md

MarcoFalke,2018-09-05T19:16:02Z,"Right, could make sense to remove it in build-unix.md as well.\n\nThough, shouldn't the configure options be independent of operating system? So maybe a doc shared across all os that describes the configure options could make sense.

bitstein,2018-09-05T19:20:29Z,"I noticed every operating system has a very difficult structure and format for its build instructions. It would be nice to see that more standardized. In this instance, I had been specifically building on OSX, which made me notice the missing section. I'll make that commit and update the PR title for now.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14153#discussion_r215395231,215395231,doc/build-osx.md
