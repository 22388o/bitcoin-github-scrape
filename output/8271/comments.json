    "body": "To 0.13.0 nodes these blocks should not have witnesses, as there has not been a softfork to define them. Sure it could strip them off before processing when received from a 0.13.1 node, but that is inefficient (especially for a protocol that tries to minimize bandwidth) and does not solve the problem for other potential future data extensions to the serialization.\n\n0.13.1 will never request from 0.13.0 after segwit activation, as blocks are only downloaded from other peers that can provide witnesses.\n",
