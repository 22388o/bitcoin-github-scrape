sipa,2016-11-29T19:21:59Z,"I think this is a bit radical. As long as no alternative for mempool sync exists (like mempool reconciliation), I think it's a useful feature. The resource usage and privacy concerns can be addressed by for example only responding incrementally (a second mempool request only gets invs for txn that were added since the previous mempool request) or further rate limiting.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9238#issuecomment-263670623,263670623,

I don't really think it is a good use of a service bit for this.  We already closed off the use of the mempool requests for timing analysis (as much as relay is closed off, at least).
