jnewbery,2018-10-25T17:44:22Z,Thanks for fixing this @jonasschnelli! I see that the same commit (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/18f05c765c800126b74a6d5b7f33cef7c9aae1b7) that changed the `WindowsBounds` value from a string to a bytes object also changed `backgroundImageAlias` to a bytes object. Does that also need to be changed back to a string for Python 3?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14416#issuecomment-433142979,433142979,
