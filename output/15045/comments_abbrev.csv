If a script is valid with standardness flags, removing these flags shouldn't make it invalid.\n\nThis also fixed an existing bug that many tests containing standardness flags (mostly STRICTENC) are unnecessarily skipped.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15045#discussion_r248372069,248372069,src/test/script_tests.cpp
