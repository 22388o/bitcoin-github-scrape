promag,2018-02-16T10:47:59Z,utACK 30e9d24. Can you create the transaction programatically instead?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12436#issuecomment-366202809,366202809,
l2a5b1,2018-03-09T00:20:19Z,"Thanks @promag! I have added two additional tests, which create the transaction programmatically per your request, to assert that the minimum and maximum transaction version number in the RPC output are a signed 32-bit integer. I have kept the utACKed test vector, because it is part of the issue that we are trying to resolve.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12436#issuecomment-371670901,371670901,

jnewbery,2018-04-02T21:29:45Z,I don't see the reason for using this particular transaction. The max and min versions below seem sufficient to me.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12436#discussion_r178656010,178656010,test/functional/rpc_rawtransaction.py
