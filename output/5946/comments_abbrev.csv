I was planning on just writing to the mailing list for the later, but having an editable document in the wiki or somewhere with the whole proposed API (even if it has question marks in some functions) will probably be better.\nI will do that after I reorganize t",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5946#issuecomment-87203127,87203127,

I'm not very happy with it as it is myself, because it ends with a little bit of a hack to get rid of the chain.o dependency.

Why the move away from blockindex->pprev ?

I don't like much myself but I wanted to give an example of a C API at the end of #5995. As explained there, that's the last thing is done (there) to help people replace those last 2 commits with their own proposal.\nBut we can start to prepare that removi",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5946#issuecomment-91606456,91606456,
