practicalswift,2021-10-03 08:51:43,@MarcoFalke Nice cleanup! I think we can get rid of the entire `ParsePrechecks` function now since the only remaining caller `ParseDouble` is unused (last use of `ParseDouble` removed in 78c312c983255e15fc274de2368a2ec13ce81cbf).,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23156#issuecomment-932891458,932891458,
