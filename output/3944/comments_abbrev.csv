laanwj,2014-03-23T08:11:40Z,"Indeed. Only update copyright headers when something in the code changed in that year.\n\nNote that the copyright headers in src/test and qa/ were added recently, so the adding of those headers doesn't count towards the year either.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3944#issuecomment-38376633,38376633,

laanwj,2014-03-24T08:05:17Z,"I vaguely remember that historically the reason that Copyright (C) is used in software is that (C) in itself is not the real copyright symbol and thus may not be valid in court.\n(There is Â©, but using non-ASCII characters in C/C++ source is still non-portable)\n\nBut even if not strictly necessary anymore, please don't do an all-over-the-place update for this.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3944#issuecomment-38419359,38419359,

""Copyright 2014"" sounds unambigious, has no redundancy, looks good, uses no non-ASCII characters ... so why is ""Copyright (c) 2014"" so often prefered?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3944#issuecomment-38420935,38420935,

felipelalli,2014-03-24T16:27:40Z,"Actually isn't wrong as well to change all files to 2014, since the file is fundamental part of the entire project and the project was modified.
