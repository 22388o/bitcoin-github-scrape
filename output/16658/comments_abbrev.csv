michaelfolkson,2019-09-07 12:49:09,"Concept ACK. I ran a `git grep` on `CheckInputs` in this PR branch and apart from old release notes that obviously won't change, there  is a `ValidateCheckInputsForAllFlags` function in `src/test/txvalidationcache_tests.cpp`, a `CheckInputsAndUpdateCoins` function in `src/txmempool.cpp` and `CheckInputsFromMempoolAndCache` function in `src/validation.cpp`.
