laanwj,2012-06-12T20:49:47Z,"BTW one unrelated comment regarding your commit messages. It's not very urgent, and there's no need to change it for current pulls. However, currently you try to trim everything into one line, this makes for very long ""git log"" lines when abbreviated. The general format that most people use for a commit message is:\n\n```\n<short description of ~50 chars>\n\n<long description>\n```\n\nfor example,",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1434#issuecomment-6282405,6282405,
