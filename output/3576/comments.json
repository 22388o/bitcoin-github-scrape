If the `getaccount` returns an account name which is not listed in `listaccounts`, it's considered a \"sending\" address. This is a disgusting workaround, and it requires access to the wallet.dat. I designed the api call in this PR for my own needs, but maybe it would be better to have something like `listalladdresses` which doesn't assume any kind of intent and wouldn't necessarily run into the account name overlapping issues. Then again, I can't really think of any other use cases to argue in favor its existence.\n",

But in practical use, people don't change their address EVERY time and if they don't care about the MORE apparent visibility then why does it matter?\n\nMy argument here is that its not a huge change but gives a HUGE UX improvement for some bitcoin clients. If there is some other way this can be done that is \"cleaner\" that would be awesome as you have already mentioned, Bitcoin-QT already has this type of functionality in some way.\n\nI'd just love to see this merged as I know it would save a lot of people some pain :).\n",

    "body": "@luke-jr is right: the label/account system is messed up due to historical reasons. This further confuses them.\n\nbitcoind has accounts, bitcoin-qt has labels. There is no way to have it vice versa. This would require changes to the storage format as well as the wallet API that no one is planning to do.\n\nBut even without this conflict the account system has many properties that people find.. unexpected atleast. Everyone expects a different thing from it, it appears, it's a bit of a layering violation to have it in bitcoind in the first place.\n\nIf you have a multi-user site I must recommend to make account (internal ledger) functionality yourself as a layer on top so you can implement it in the way that you expect. If you need something that maps addresses to users, keep your own database. Do not use bitcoind accounts.\n\nA future wallet redesign will likely not have per-address labels or accounts at all (at least not accounts in the current ledger sense, maybe subwallets consisting of deterministic address 'streams' that BIP-0032 calls accounts). \n\nEdit: but apart from my critic on direction, the code changes look ok\n",
