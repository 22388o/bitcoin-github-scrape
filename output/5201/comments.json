While thinking deeply about how code and data structures should work, reordering and writing new code, it's easy to make a stylistic \"mistake\" here and there. Focusing too much on them is distracting. This is true during review as well.\n\nI'm not sure how to handle this better - the two-phase approach is just a proposal that may not actually work either - but 'Please Dia don't always spam our pulls with nits' sounds good to me for now.\n",
