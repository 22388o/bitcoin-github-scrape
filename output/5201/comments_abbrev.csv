laanwj,2014-11-03T12:53:24Z,"I think even with this we should split up the review of difficult pulls into two phases:\n- In the first phase, we allow only only commentary on the correctness of the code and the overall concept\n- Then just before merging we can go into a ""clean up"" phase, and nit about extra spaces, indentation, comment style and other minor details\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5201#issuecomment-61473349,61473349,

Diapolo,2014-11-03T14:43:40Z,"Fell free to do that, I just think it's anoying to make such nits for core devs anyway. If all would use this convention, it wouldn't even cause the need for a ""cleanup phase"" nor the need for such a pull ;).\n\nIt's also likely that not many will ever contribute to such a cleanup phase... if the intention is: ""Please Dia don't always ""spam"" our pulls with nits!""

laanwj,2014-11-03T15:15:01Z,"@Diapolo Yes, _if_ everyone would keep exactly to the convention. But we're human, not robots (ok, speaking just for me). While thinking deeply about how code and data structures should work, reordering and writing new code, it's easy to make a stylistic ""mistake"" here and there. Focusing too much on them is distracting. This is true during review as well.\n\nI'm not sure how to handle this better",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5201#issuecomment-61491886,61491886,
jgarzik,2014-11-03T16:33:05Z,"Indeed.  Referencing the Linux kernel, there were periodic cleanup patches from ""janitors"" who are typically just entering the codebase / learning the code.  This is better than nagging on every PR.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5201#issuecomment-61505205,61505205,
sipa,2014-11-03T16:46:03Z,"At Google there were very strict rules about ordering of includes etc, and this worked well. But that was with automatic tools for reordering, and their code-review tool would tell you about this immediately (and many more things), so it was much easier to make sure that everybody always knows and used the same system.\n\nHere we tried, and I don't think the benefits are worth the effort.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5201#issuecomment-61507476,61507476,
