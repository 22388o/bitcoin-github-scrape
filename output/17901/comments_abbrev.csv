paymog,2020-01-11 17:06:05,nit: `spec` might also be read as `specific` or `specification` when a new reader comes into the codebase. I think naming it with the full `specialHelp` you use in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17901/files#diff-8c9d79ba40bf702f01685008550ac100R482 would make it easier on new readers to understand what's going on.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17901#discussion_r365531642,365531642,src/qt/utilitydialog.h
paymog,2020-01-11 17:11:50,It helps encapsulate logic by naming a block of code. I don't have strong opinions on this but I think it would be helpful for readers. It looks like this loop is determining if the provided `helpName` is a valid command name.
