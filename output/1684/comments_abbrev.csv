laanwj,2012-08-18T07:35:08Z,"@luke-jr So to decode that, you mean run this importing in a thread (after the Init succeeds), pretend that the blocks come in from the network, and use the current progress mechanism? I suppose that could work, if you block the real network for the duration that the file is being read.\n\nAlso it doesn't address the above points. Does it somehow need to remember where it was with importing, betwe",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1684#issuecomment-7842609,7842609,
Diapolo,2012-08-18T09:07:31Z,"I recently added an info message when doing a -loadblock, so this needs a rebase + the shorter the message the better, because of the small splashscreen.\n\n@luke-jr When doing a -loadblock nothing is interactive, the client is just displaying the splashscreen and a message for ~1 hour or more.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1684#issuecomment-7843040,7843040,
luke-jr,2012-08-18T13:26:38Z,"@laanwj I guess that would keep the current IBD behaviour during a loadblocks. However, it seems like it has potential to slow things down, so should probably be tested.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1684#issuecomment-7844448,7844448,
laanwj,2012-08-18T14:38:01Z,"It should not be used for the specific -loadblocks, which is also a benchmark. \n\nBut for the automatic loadblocks for bootstrapping users (that jgarzik is proposing) it'd be fine. It's fine if it is a bit slower as long as the user gets feedback and doesn't have the idea that his client crashed at the splash screen.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1684#issuecomment-7844969,7844969,

gmaxwell,2012-08-20T13:21:59Z,Am I misunderstanding this patch?  It looks like it will reimport at every startup because it doesn't remove/move/flag the file when done. That seems pretty surprising.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1684#issuecomment-7868811,7868811,
