gmaxwell,2012-08-30T20:14:44Z,ACK. Works great for me. (tried a number of raw transactions on testnet with it)\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1758#issuecomment-8172803,8172803,
Diapolo,2012-08-30T21:19:01Z,I'll take a look at this tomorrow and see if the Windows weirdness is solved by this.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1758#issuecomment-8174892,8174892,
Diapolo,2012-08-31T06:31:22Z,"2 suggestions:\n1. I would like to see a general comment in the code, which explains what is covered by parseCommandLine().\n2. I tried the code with the example from the issue thread.\n\nWorks:\n`addmultisigaddress 2 '[""02404c0b780b0d3f70a57bccb0cac31c77e980d899db00f04a61052cf6500bde23"",""02092eb733ce9027fcddb9917e841057c747318ff973de7a7768da9b3f039d6892""]'`\n\nFails:\n`addmultisigaddress 2 '[\""02",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1758#issuecomment-8183753,8183753,
laanwj,2012-08-31T06:59:25Z,"That is as expected. You must not escape ' within "" and ' within "". The\nreason for having two types of quotes in the first place is that you can\navoid escaping.\n\nShells have the same behavior. Try in bash echo ""\'"". It will print\nliterally \'.\n\nIf there is a help message that makes you do differently that's a separate\nissue. Which help message is wrong? Btw this still has nothing to do wit",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1758#issuecomment-8184121,8184121,
Diapolo,2012-08-31T07:12:21Z,"@laanwj I was not quite sure, if the code was platform independent, that is why I mentioned Windows.\n\nJust enter `addmultisigaddress` for example and take a look at the message. It clearly mentions `<'[\""key\"",\""key\""]'>`, which makes users think they need to specify `\""` instead of just `""` (which works after your patch).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1758#issuecomment-8184310,8184310,
gavinandresen,2012-08-31T12:54:46Z,"ACK.\n\nHelp should be fixed (and we need a new syntax for specifying optional arguments), but that's a separate issue.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1758#issuecomment-8191017,8191017,
laanwj,2012-08-31T15:45:27Z,"Help (as in the help X command) was already working. It seems that what @diapolo was seeing is that error messages are dumped as raw JSON object, instead of formatted (and that you get help for free as error if you issue an command without the needed # of arguments).\n\nI've added basic formatting for errors. I've also added a doxygen comment to explain what `parseCommand` does.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1758#issuecomment-8196136,8196136,
gmaxwell,2012-08-31T15:48:39Z,ACK.\n\nPerhaps we should do the error formating for bitcoind output too?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1758#issuecomment-8196232,8196232,
laanwj,2012-09-01T05:48:41Z,"Indeed, the error reporting there ( https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/bitcoinrpc.cpp#L1184\n ) could be changed in the same way, to prevent similar confusion.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1758#issuecomment-8210265,8210265,
