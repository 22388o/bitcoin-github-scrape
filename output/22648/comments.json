I agree instructions for every implementation would be overkill, but I was completely new to i2p, and I had to do a bit of digging to figure out how to set it up.  I found the wording a bit confusing (I thought I had to install a router and install SAM).  The documentation on the website is mostly about setting up a browser.  I think adding instructions for users for the reference implementation could be helpful in increasing i2p nodes.  The tor docs include a bit of instructions as well",

Most people I talk to are using i2pd (admittedly perhaps because it is very easy to install), so if we explain how to install i2p-router, we should probably also do it for i2pd.

Bob wants to use Tor proxy for outbound connections, he is okay with connecting to any nodes (onion, ipv4 etc.)\r\n\r\nSo Alice can use `onlynet=ipv4` and `proxy=127.0.0.1:9050`.

This option can be\n                     specified multiple times to allow multiple network types, e.g.\n-                    ipv4, ipv6 or onion. If you use this option with values other\n-                    than onion you *cannot* disable onion connections; outgoing onion\n-                    connections will be enabled when you use -proxy or -onion. Use\n-                    -noonion or -onion=0 if you want to be sure there are no outbound\n-                    onion connections over the default proxy or your defined -proxy.\n+                    onlynet=ipv4, onlynet=ipv6, onlynet=onion, onlynet=i2p.\n+                    Warning: if you use -onlynet with values other than onion, and\n+                    the -onion or -proxy option is set, then outgoing onion\n+                    connections will still be made; use -noonion or -onion=0 to\n+                    disable outbound onion connections in this case.",
