jonasschnelli,2017-03-21T10:30:53Z,"> How does this affect users of the wallet or RPC? Does this need backports?\n\nI'm not entirely sure. I haven't analysed the full ramification.\nIt looks like, that we only use the DER encoding during serialisation to and deserialisation from the database. Internally it should be treated correctly. Walletdump, etc. should be correct.\n\nAt the moment, I'm not sure what happens if you import ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10043#issuecomment-288037084,288037084,
gmaxwell,2017-03-29T13:42:09Z,"(as was discussed in the last meeting)\n\nThis has no effect, we never read it. It's just idiocy in the format that a public key is saved inside the private key at all. I think it should just always set compressed here.
