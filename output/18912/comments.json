    "body": "It is not a specific test that causes problems, but if we start adding a new travis build for any configuration that could possibly find an issue, it is going to slow down everything in the same way.\r\n\r\nFor example we could add an alpine build (#18110) to check against musl libc, we could add a centos 7 build to check the minimum supported version of boost (#18943), we could add a *bsd run to check compilation against *bsd, we could add a build to check against the guix binaries, we could add a build to run the fuzzers on musl libc, we could ...\r\n\r\nAt some point we need to take into account the cost of a build against the value it adds.\r\n\r\nI think as part of every pull request we should only run essential builds that, if failed, would bring the project development to a halt. For example breaking the gui build, or the `--disable-wallet` build would break most dev environments, either immediately or later when debugging a `--disable-wallet` bug via git bisect. Another example would be breaking the unit tests or functional tests. Intermittent issues are excluded from here, because it is impossible to protect against them.\r\n\r\nIf, however the build is broken for a few days on a system that is not run by developers (e.g. centos 7) or alpine linux, it would not bring the development to a halt.\r\n\r\nIf more builds are added to travis, then someone needs to pay for them. Personally, I think the value we get out of travis is not worth the money we spend on them. Partly because they fail to address our issues like #18868 .\r\n\r\nWhoever is going to renew (or not renew) the contract for the next 12 months should take this into account.",

    "body": "> It is not a specific test that causes problems, but if we start adding a new travis build for any configuration that could possibly find an issue, it is going to slow down everything in the same way.\r\n>\r\n> For example we could add an alpine build (#18110) to check against musl libc, we could add a centos 7 build to check the minimum supported version of boost (#18943), we could add a *bsd run to check compilation against *bsd, we could add a build to check against the guix binaries, we could add a build to run the fuzzers on musl libc, we could ...\r\n\r\nThat is true, but note that not all issues are equally important for protecting our user's funds :)\r\n\r\nThe now removed `valgrind` fuzzing job helps us catch *security* issues whereas the examples you quote would help us catch non-security issues.\r\n\r\n(Meta comment about our peer review process: I fully understand the frustration with Travis but TBH I think it was a mistake to lock #18899 immediately after merge without answering the [question](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18899#issuecomment-625189502) that was raised during peer review about the surprising fuzzing job removal.)",
