My proposal was largely intended to be temporary till something more permanent could be written up, so hey, I'm only too glad to see that someone's beaten me to fixing the OS X dependency issues. I thoroughly approve of the way @theuni went about doing this, It's darn impressive stuff. My apologies for my redundant PR.\n",
