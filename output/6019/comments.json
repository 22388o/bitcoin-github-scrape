    "body": "Agree that this won't work.\n\nI don't think Qt supports strings with custom allocators. And if want to use your own string type, at the very least you'd need to implement a custom text field to make use of it. There's no saying what QLineEdit, or at a lower level, X/Win32/OSX, does internally. It may scatter buffers with (part of) the passphrase everywhere in the heap.\n\nA possible suggestion (I think by @gmaxwell) was for a \"secure entry\" sandbox, e.g. launching a new process that runs fully memory-locked that captures the passphrase and does the private key handling and signing so that nothing sensitive has to leave the process. This would also allow utilizing special OS support for process isolation.\n",

    "body": "Just checked and found out that QT does not support custom or secure allocators. It would required to dig down the whole path to the OS implementation (for the three supported platforms) which would be hard to implement and very hard to maintain (not only that it runs also that it is secure).\n\nThe separated secure entry process would make more sense but even there its not trivial to implement.\n\nMaybe wallet encryption should go more into a direction of easy-multisig-usage or other concepts of store partial data in a \"cold-space\".\n",
