laanwj,2019-01-14T16:26:37Z,"FWIW: There was some discussion on IRC about storing authentication tokens in the git configuration. According to @promag this is not a good idea (I guess because some people have these files under version control?). He suggests using an environment variable instead. I'm not sure if this is a good idea because environment variables 'leak' through `/proc/<pid>/environ`, and if you set it in `.bashr",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15165#issuecomment-454067128,454067128,
