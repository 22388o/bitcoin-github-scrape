Runtime of this test seems to be identical to what it was before this PR - I also should note this test turns out to be a really good benchmark for this PR as it is a pretty good worst-case scenario and stress test for doing tons of rbf signaling checks",

    "body": "@luke-jr\r\n\r\n> But it isn't related to the CVE at all. The security issue is that some software assumes the network has a consistent and firm policy as if it were a consensus rule. That's an issue regardless of what policy Bitcoin Core implements.\r\n\r\nI think the security issue is qualified in the consequences for downstream Bitcoin users of the code defect _compared_  to the standard. Such standard committed by Core in `doc/bips.md`.\r\n\r\nIn a decentralized system such as Bitcoin, I don't think we can admit an authoritative enumeration of the valid assumptions an application can draw on the p2p network. It's more constructive to argue in the way \"If we assume X, is Y safer, cheaper, easier-to-design ?\".\r\n\r\nIf we assume BIP152 to be widely deployed, block propagation is faster and overall network security better.\r\nIf we assume BIP330 to be widely deployed, transaction bandwidth consumption is better and cost-to-run a full-node lower.\r\nIf we assume BIP125 to be widely deployed,  LN security is better as LN nodes can adapt to mempools congestion.\r\n\r\nFollowing this reasoning, as protocol developers, I think we can rationally discuss about the benefits of assumptions for the wider ecosystem and even how to make them more \"binding\".",

I'm hoping this also makes it easier to reason about `PreChecks()` performance, and any potential for increased DoS surface.\r\n- improve performance, I believe `getrawmempool` (verbose) and `getmempoolentry` will run faster in all-cases (and possibly significantly faster in worst-case scenarios) than before this PR due to this optimization. But I think `PreChecks()` performance is probably more important, and more work is done in `PreChecks()` to check for inherited signaling after this PR -- so we need to ensure that is acceptable.",

    "body": "> This PR sort of opposes #22665 - I think they are two different approaches to solving some of the confusing behavior we currently have with BIP 125 / RBF. And they should both be considered, although I think it's one or the other.\r\n\r\nI disagree that it is one or the other (at least assuming this PR can be rebased on top of a future merged #22665 reversing some changes). I think #22665 addresses confusion over not following the BIP wording in the short term (quick fix) and then this PR actually implements that BIP wording in the longer term (not a quick fix). I need to think more about whether the BIP wording should be implemented in the longer term. It seems dependent on speculating on when/if we are able to implement full RBF within the next couple of major versions of Core or not. ",

I was hesitant before because I think adherence to this interpretation of BIP125#1 (which was written after the code) is insufficient rationale; it is better to focus on implementing what's appropriate for the node. I realized it's better to implement inherited signaling for now (independent of any full RBF plans), as it's a simpler interface for wallets. Right now, descendants of replaceable transactions _are_ replaceable despite not \"inheriting\" signaling (simply replace its signaling ancestor) but wallets devs shoudn't need to work around that.\r\n\r\nThanks for helping to document and test the RBF logic!",
