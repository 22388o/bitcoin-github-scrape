achow101,2019-09-07 15:26:13,I don't think this check for an unknown key is necessary in the same way the it is not needed for partial sigs or hd keypaths. It is a map of unknowns and we aren't checking if something is null.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16821#discussion_r321973159,321973159,src/psbt.h
