I dont think it would work for parallel deployments.\r\n\r\nIf they don't signal, the warning after lock in via bip8 won't be shown, but that's no worse than the current bip8 without this modification.\r\nFalse signaling is more concerning, probably the code should allow for bip8 warnings to be disabled optionally.\r\nFalse signaling is also possible today (although requires 95% to trigger the warning), so perhaps we should also add an option to disable bip9 warnings.\r\n\r\nI think there's little incentive for miners to false signal here (or with plain bip9) though.\r\n\r\n",
