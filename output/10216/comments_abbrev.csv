NicolasDorier,2018-03-18T07:43:30Z,"@JeremyRand I just gave up using the RPC for my projects, getting things merged here is a bit too much effort, it was easier for me to create [NBXplorer](https://github.com/dgarage/NBXplorer/) which is a lightweight block explorer for bitcoin also working on pruned mode.\n\nFeel free to rebase and take this PR if you feel the strength to get it merged, I would review.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10216#issuecomment-373978907,373978907,
