laanwj,2013-12-10T11:10:33Z,This bug was not introduced when switching to deleteLater.\nTry testing the commit directly before that.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3382#issuecomment-30217037,30217037,
Diapolo,2013-12-10T11:17:01Z,"@laanwj I assumed that was the case, because I remember during my sendcoins changes I verified that I can't delete the last entry. Anyway, do you just want me to remove the description ;)?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3382#issuecomment-30217433,30217433,
laanwj,2013-12-10T11:21:14Z,I just want to be sure that we know the correct cause of the behavior change.\nI remember that I also noticed this behavior back when I changed it to deleteLater and then tested the previous version and the behavior was already there.\nIt could be  that I made a git mistake though...\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3382#issuecomment-30217696,30217696,

laanwj,2013-12-10T11:33:43Z,I think this can be improved further by adding a entry->hide() here.\n\nWith this patch it looks like there are two entries for a very slight moment.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3382#discussion_r8229069,8229069,src/qt/sendcoinsdialog.cpp
