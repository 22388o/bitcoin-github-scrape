droark,2016-06-14T00:26:56Z,"Hmmm. Haven't run this but, going off my recollection of Gitian builds (haven't done one in awhile), all the stuff built in a Gitian container is self-contained and built away from the normal directory structure. So, I don't think this patch is necessary. Nice thought, though, and I could be totally wrong. :)\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8197#issuecomment-225748057,225748057,

laanwj,2016-06-14T06:58:57Z,"@droark You would be right if `split-debug.sh` was only generated by the gitian descriptors. However the build system itself generates the file, so it does have to be ignored, as that's how we define the contents of `.gitignore` in this project.\n\n(@sipa is right and it is not ""necessary"" to do so, however it prevents this generated file from accidentally being checked in)\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8197#issuecomment-225795733,225795733,
droark,2016-06-14T07:51:52Z,"@laanwj @sipa - Thanks for the correction. What I meant with my original comment was that I was under the impression that the generated file wouldn't be picked up in the original directory, and that .gitignore didn't have to be updated. (Obviously, .gitignore and Gitian are unrelated. I didn't mean to imply that.) I was wrong, though. C'est la vie. :)\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8197#issuecomment-225805526,225805526,
