laanwj,2015-06-05T16:39:47Z,"I don't get it. Why do you need unsigned integer here? If these are truly outside the 64 bit signed integer range, these tests should not be passing.\nAs I understand it, the range of int64_t should be -2^63 to 2^63-1, or .`-9223372036854775808` to `9223372036854775807`. These are the limits that I'm testing.\nAm I mistaken?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6241#issuecomment-109357396,109357396,
