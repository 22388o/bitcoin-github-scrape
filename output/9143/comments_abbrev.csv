sipa,2016-12-01T01:24:10Z,"That probably should have been moved to ZapWalletTx. It wiped the default key, to make sure a new key would be generated next time. The default key is effectively unused currently, we should remove it entirely.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9143#discussion_r90366699,90366699,src/wallet/walletdb.cpp
jonasschnelli,2016-12-01T08:20:11Z,I think I removed this because it's no longer in use. But agree with @sipa. We should remove it entirely.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9143#discussion_r90400322,90400322,src/wallet/walletdb.cpp
sipa,2016-12-01T08:35:01Z,"I tried writing a patch to remove it, but I believe we basically can't without breaking backward compatibility for wallet files.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9143#discussion_r90402032,90402032,src/wallet/walletdb.cpp
ryanofsky,2017-01-24T22:00:08Z,"Just noting: This call is dropped, but presumably this isn't a problem because the same min version should have already been set when the wallet was first loaded.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9143#discussion_r97661557,97661557,src/wallet/walletdb.cpp
