emilengler,2019-10-04 15:17:33,"Concept NACK.\nThe planned release date is `2020-01-03`.\nThis means that there might be some code changes in 2020 as well.\nI think that this script should executed at the end of every year and SHORTLY before a release.\n@laanwj When you do the final commits, could you run this script again?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17053#issuecomment-538441776,538441776,
emilengler,2019-10-04 15:27:52,Also running this script to often is not a good approach. You are changing 287 files which means that if a user is currently working on a file which was changed by you he would need to rebase which wouldn't be the effort worth in my opinion. Sorry.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17053#issuecomment-538446091,538446091,
laanwj,2019-10-05 09:23:38,"AFAIK the current way of working is to run this script at the end of a year *on master only*. It doesn't really have anything to do with the release cycle.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17053#issuecomment-538633279,538633279,
emilengler,2019-10-05 21:27:30,"@laanwj \nIIRC @DrahtBot runs opens a PR for this every year.\nHowever in #16789 @MarcoFalke said that this should be done before every new release.\nI agree with this because the release is also delivered as a (de-facto) tarball and it should correct there as well.\nSo I would suggest to add this process to the release process as well",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17053#issuecomment-538689836,538689836,
laanwj,2019-10-06 08:48:38,I don't agree. I don't care if the copyright years are a year off (and the downsides is that it can cause merge conflicts).,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17053#issuecomment-538724889,538724889,
