jgarzik,2011-04-15T22:51:22Z,Comments:\n\n1) This is duplicating work at https://github.com/jgarzik/bitcoin/tree/autotools which was mentioned on the forums at http://www.bitcoin.org/smf/index.php?topic=2772.msg82737#msg82737\n\n2) You arbitrarily changed the license to GPLv3.  NAK.\n\n3) autotools conversion does not require a total bitcoin source tree reorg.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/162#issuecomment-1011207,1011207,

jaromil,2011-04-15T23:02:53Z,looked at your branch: not so much duplication since we're both just at the beginning.\n\nyet you might like the use of libtool in my branch :)\n\nhack on\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/162#issuecomment-1011257,1011257,
jgarzik,2011-04-15T23:23:06Z,"Well, FWIW it is unlikely that this branch will be pulled.  All these are the sorts of changes we -do- want, but in general you're wrapping way too many major changes into a single pull request.  The right way to do this is with small, incremental changes, in separate pull requests that can be evaluated on their own merits, after being discussed on the forums.\n\nFor example, everyone has their ow",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/162#issuecomment-1011316,1011316,
jaromil,2011-04-15T23:32:11Z,"i don't understand what you mean with Grand API Designs: since bitcoin has already an API, i have no illusions of grandeur here. code reorganization needs stuff to be moved around and there are guidelines and standards for that. however i see we have different views on more things: code splitting needed as mentioned by Jim Hyslop on the forum, as well reluctance to libtool.\n\ni don't want to rewr",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/162#issuecomment-1011341,1011341,
jgarzik,2011-04-16T00:15:43Z,"There is no reluctance to libtool; it is a simple, binary decision:  libbitcoin does not exist, therefore libtool should not be used.
