gmaxwell,2015-11-23T10:05:09Z,"@pstratem Okay, I split it up and also added protection for tx relayers.\n\nI wanted to get something in that distinguishes good onion peers from bad;  ultimately I want to add peer POW to this, but thats a non-trivial amount of work.  So right now TXs are at least something.\n\nIt would be good to add blocks too, though that block addition pipeline makes it a little hard to avoid crediting people",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7082#issuecomment-158892909,158892909,
