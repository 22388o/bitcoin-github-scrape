    "body": ">Did this help with the variance from before?\r\n\r\n@JeremyRubin my personal benchmarking bandwidth is rather limited. I'm trying to get another machine set up to do more extensive benchmarking on this. My numbers were done on a 12 virtual core CPU with internal SSD. I think this might have a wide variance of performance increase depending on CPU and disk types. However, the results I had were very promising so I submitted this for concept approval. I will come back with some more numbers soon(ish).\r\n\r\n>I don't want to go overkill but I wonder if there's a nicer way to communicate the start warming/stop warming instructions (e.g. not just tweaking flags so there's some sort of interface).\r\n\r\nI thought I had done a pretty good job of this by wrapping it in `WarmBlock`/`CancelWarmingBlock` methods. I'll think some more on this. I'm open to suggestions.\r\n\r\n>I also wonder if it makes sense to just always completely finish warming the cache or not? Aborting warming early still means the work has to happen in serial (at some point) with the main thread.\r\n\r\nMy benchmarks showed this to have consistently negative performance. I also tried locking/unlocking inside `ConnectBlock` only where the coins were actually accessed, but it was also less performant and would have also made this diff a lot more complex.\r\n\r\n>Is there ever a circumstance where the warmer gets the cache full that it evicts its own warmed entries? Can we detect this and just stop then?\r\n\r\nI don't think this can occur. The cache is flushed only after `ConnectBlock` in `ConnectTip`, so the effect will be the same when warming coins in `ConnectBlock` or right before.",

    "body": "@jnewbery I can definitely appreciate that perspective! However, I think concentrating on the 2.3% speedup is a pessimistic take on this patch. It has a 7.1% increase in speed for recent blocks, which are what we are likely to continue to experience in the future. While a user only has to perform IBD from genesis once, they will have to sync recent blocks every time they turn on the node. I think optimizing the common user flow of using the node, then turning off for days/weeks/months until it's used again will prove to be a big benefit. I also think I can find a way to increase IBD from genesis somewhat, but am still experimenting and will get more concrete numbers together. As I said in the description, this will only become more beneficial as the block chain grows.\r\n\r\nI also don't think this is that invasive of a patch. It's not changing any logic with any of the actual validation code. It is just looping through the inputs of a block before the actual validation occurs. This seems like an easy win for a bump of 7%.\r\n\r\nYou are correct that this doesn't improve block propagation. I didn't claim that it did. However, block propagation is only the first step for a block to be useful to a user; it still has to be connected after it is propagated. Increasing propagation to miners isn't as useful if it still takes a long time to validate the block afterwards. Miners (and all users, really) want to have the block connected as soon as possible. This can reduce forks by allowing miners to start mining on top of the block faster, and improve miner revenue by more quickly determining the optimal block template to mine on.",

Your ThreadWarmCoinsCache thread is taking cs_main, grabbing a pointer to the coins tip, then dropping cs_main and continuing to write to the cache object. Meanwhile, the message handler thread or any other thread could also be accessing that same cache and reading/writing to it. Surely cs_main needs to be held for as long as you have the coins view cache?",

Calling `CoinsTip` will cancel the current block warming and acquire the warming lock, and it can't start warming another block until it takes `cs_main` again.

While out of the propagation path for compact blocks, this is still in path for mining so there is a motivating factor IMO.\r\n\r\nRepeated uncontended locking is sufficiently cheap that I'd be curious to see the performance difference if the warming thread just tries to grab the lock before every read/write and receives an atomic flag from the main thread to quit warming at a certain point. This would make the algorithm more 'obviously correct' and I think would have negligible performance impact as the lock won't be contended. \r\n\r\nI'd also be curious if we can start the warming even earlier.

    "body": "I had originally been benchmarking by connecting to a single peer in the local network, which processes the new block and connects each block serially.

When benchmarking a true IBD with multiple remote peers, the node gets a *lot* more time to warm the blocks as they come in.\r\n\r\nDoing a full IBD with `-prune=10000 -stopatheight=635000` on the same machine as before, I get an increase in speed of 39% (548 minutes in master, 337 minutes in this branch) and total block connect time speed increase of 7% (`14563.66s (22.93ms/blk)` in master, `13571.83s (21.37ms/blk)` in this branch). Total time warming coins was `4294.83s`.\r\n\r\nDoing a full IBD to block 635000 with no pruning on an older quad core machine with SSD, I get a speed increase in total time of 12% (28 hours in master, 24.75 hours in this branch) and total connect time speed increase of 16% (`67425.83s (106.18ms/blk)` in master, `56600.08s (89.13ms/blk)` in this branch).

The cache can be filled and the coins evicted before the block is connected. I'll work on updating this so it won't happen.\r\n\r\nI'm still working on refactoring the locking interface, but I wanted to share my findings.

    "body": "@JeremyRubin Thanks for checking in, as well as for all your help and encouragement!\r\n\r\nI've pushed my latest. I've taken your suggestion and moved the thread handling to a new class `BlockWarmer`, and added an instance of it as a member variable of `CChainState`. Also added locking annotations. I think it makes it a lot more clear what is being changed with the validation logic. I can also write unit tests for it now.\r\n\r\nAs for what I'm felling stuck on, it's difficult to get a consistent benchmark on this. It's also very time consuming since I don't have a bunch of machines to keep running this on. It's consistently faster doing IBD, but the speedup varies widely, to above 20% to low single digits. I think I might have to setup something in the local network to pretend to be multiple peers. I'm also thinking I should write a benchmark for time to connect after receiving a block in `ProcessNewBlock`. I think I need to demonstrate objectively that there is a speedup here worth the added complexity.\r\n\r\nAlso, since we are downloading blocks out of order, I'm not sure if we could warm a block but it won't be processed until after the next flush. Not sure if it's possible to detect that.",
