    "body": "This is certainly not back on the table at all, imho.  There were very good reasons this pull request was closed out in 2012.  I would encourage people to re-read the remarks (including those of @gavinandresen as shown [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1536#issuecomment-6716066)) and @gmaxwell's.\n\nIt's a bad idea to take a nuclear option with respect to fees and reject the opportunity that can be presented from analyzing microgiving potential.  Odd also that people keep referring to this as \"dust spam\" when they could be reframing the language and the issue... the current \"dust problem\" (which I would argue should actually be called a \"giving opportunity\") is an opportunity to re-examine transactions, transforming them into bursts of microgiving.  Do not foreclose on the an opportunity to re-examine and re-envision transactions and thus change the system you are using.\n\nIn closing, I would also recommend you see issue #6402 as an example (of how this could be handled better, perhaps) and also some of the more recent comments on #6201 (including one that I've entered).\n",
