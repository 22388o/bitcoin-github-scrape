gmaxwell,2012-06-29T20:01:54Z,"This doesn't sound bad— although generally I'd like to start talking about how to get the net-change-to-the-open-txn-set included in the free/priority structure.\n\nThis is a dual attack in that it both adds static blockchain data but it also adds a ton of data which is probably never going to get redeemed, thus also burdening pruned nodes.

coblee,2012-06-29T20:06:56Z,"Yes, once you get a lot of dust spam, select coins can take forever. For Litecoin, I had to implement a workaround for people to ignore the dustspam and make them not count towards coins that they own. It was a huge pain.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1536#issuecomment-6676821,6676821,
gmaxwell,2012-06-29T20:12:50Z,"Sort of tangent— but wrt the select coins problem you might want to look at adding a post processing step: once you've prepared a txn with change and either a free txn with excess priority, or a with fee which isn't right at the boundary, then add in additional of your smallest inputs in order to get them out of your wallet (and out of pruned chains). \n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1536#issuecomment-6676959,6676959,

coblee,2012-07-02T15:53:15Z,"As Bitcoin's value increases, you will probably need to reduce the value in which a output is considered spam. For Litecoin, less than 0.01 LTC is pretty much worthless.

gavinandresen,2012-07-02T18:26:14Z,"This doesn't feel like the right fix to me.\n\nFixing the coin selection algorithm so it works quickly with wallets containing gazillions of tiny transactions is part of the solution.  Something simple like ""If there are more than X unspent outputs, don't use the fancy knapsack-problem-solver, just use the biggest-value unspent input(s) until you have enough to pay for the transaction+fee.""\n\nSee",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1536#issuecomment-6716066,6716066,

gavinandresen,2012-07-02T18:51:43Z,"Right, see the gist for the other part of what I think would be a better fix.\n\nFor a very-low-transaction-volume chain like LiteCoin, I think the right fix would involve miners specifying a small maximum block size (say 10K, enough space for 40 or so regular-sized transactions) and a high ""forgo this amount of transaction fees"" (so block space is dominated by transaction priority, not fee).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1536#issuecomment-6716717,6716717,
