ajtowns,2019-10-04 07:25:52,"Concept ACK. I think this might be better if implemented with a RAII approach, so you write:\n\n```\n{\n    ASSERT_DEBUG_LOG(""xyzzy"");\n    code();\n}\n```\n\nand an error appears if the string wasn't found by the end of the block. See https://github.com/ajtowns/bitcoin/commits/201910-assertdebuglog for a patch. This way avoids the globals and lets you just do two asserts in the same bloc",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16540#issuecomment-538278820,538278820,

MarcoFalke,2019-10-30 16:41:37,"@ajtowns This is an issue every time an `assert` is hit. The tests in that case would sleep forever, due to some boost internals, see #16700.\n\nThe correct error is still printed and the tests fail. I am not sure how to fix this minor usability issue, given that the logger is global (shared state) and the `TestingSetup` is not shut down between test cases.

ryanofsky,2019-11-05 21:34:50,"Haven't looked closely, but I'm kind of surprised you can get away with throwing an exception in a destructor (`check_found` is called by `~DebugLogHelper`).\n\nIf this works, it seems fine.
