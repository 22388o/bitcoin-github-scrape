sipa,2013-04-12T23:02:40Z,Here's a list of all effectively-height-locked transactions in the main chain (that means: excluding those where all inputs have nSequence=UINT_MAX): http://bitcoin.sipa.be/lockheight.txt - It seems the inclusion height is always at least two more than the number in nLockTime - one more than strictly required.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2342#issuecomment-16321979,16321979,
petertodd,2013-04-14T01:34:33Z,"Not many people uses nLockTime; about 75% of those transactions are mine.\n\nCan you run your script on testnet? I did one ""min-height"" tx myself, I wonder if anyone else did any.\n\nMainly I think that BlueMatt's tests need more nLockTime stuff, IE the https://github.com/TheBlueMatt/test-scripts stuff. I don't think I'll have time to write any myself until after the conference.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2342#issuecomment-16344248,16344248,

petertodd,2013-06-20T03:45:42Z,"The +1 isn't a magic number; note how in one place the patch removes a +1. Rather it's there from how nBestHeight is the height of the current best block, and in some places we want to check IsFinal() against the next block.\n\nI'd argue the +2 isn't a magic number either, as it's a combination of +1 to get the next block, and another +1 from the assumption that no-one controls >50% of the hashing",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2342#issuecomment-19729352,19729352,
