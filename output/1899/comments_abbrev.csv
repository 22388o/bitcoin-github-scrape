Diapolo,2012-10-04T11:16:05Z,"@laanwj The current proxy related pulls are not there, only because I have some GUI ideas in my mind, they make proxy usage better and extend it with nice new stuff + fix the missing lock.\n\n@TheBlueMatt As you opened the proxy lock issue, can you perhaps take a look at the code and ACK or give a short feedback?
