Diapolo,2014-06-12T11:21:58Z,Can you rebase this onto #4326?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4333#issuecomment-45879855,45879855,
jtimon,2014-06-12T11:41:45Z,"Rebased on top of Diapolo:clientmodel_networkname\nSo maybe I should maintain the testnet field and add the network one?\nMaybe I can leave ""Params().NetworkID() == CChainParams::TESTNET"" there and still get rid of the RPCisTestnet param...\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4333#issuecomment-45881363,45881363,
laanwj,2014-06-12T11:44:41Z,"@jtimon Yes, `Params().NetworkID() == CChainParams::TESTNET` is clearer than `RPCIsTestnet`. But please keep the RPC interface the same for now.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4333#issuecomment-45881560,45881560,
jtimon,2014-06-12T11:52:43Z,"Oh, I was coding it and didn't read you. So should I just cancel the last commit then?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4333#issuecomment-45882185,45882185,
laanwj,2014-06-12T11:55:52Z,Yes. We can remove them at a later time when there is a a RPC overhaul with other backwards-compat breaking changes.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4333#issuecomment-45882390,45882390,
jtimon,2014-06-12T12:00:30Z,"Adding the ""network"" field doesn't seem backwards incompatible, but it allows people to start using that instead of ""testnet"", which could be declared deprecated or something to encourage people to move already in preparation for that RPC overhaul.\nThat's why I ask if I should remove https://github.com/jtimon/bitcoin/commit/bdb2f8ee844b20f40397c2cb2937cd7d23a2d247\n\nThoughts?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4333#issuecomment-45882704,45882704,
laanwj,2014-06-12T12:02:46Z,I'm fine with adding it to `getmininginfo`. But don't touch `getinfo`. It should die.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4333#issuecomment-45882887,45882887,
Diapolo,2014-06-12T12:04:40Z,Perhaps 0.10 is a good release for killing getinfo :)?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4333#issuecomment-45883039,45883039,
laanwj,2014-06-12T12:07:30Z,"@Diapolo I'd rather wait another major release (eg: 0.10 deprecates it, 0.11 removes it). But I don't want that discussion now.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4333#issuecomment-45883274,45883274,
jtimon,2014-06-12T12:17:19Z,"Ok, done. I didn't know getinfo was meant to die.\nMaybe it makes sense to add it in other places besides getmininginfo?\nI only considered those two because only them had the ""testnet"" field.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4333#issuecomment-45884041,45884041,

jtimon,2014-06-12T12:36:40Z,"oh, I see. Probably I should use ""chain"" instead of ""network"" and the help could be uniform too.\nMaybe it should be:\n    ""  \""chain\"": \""xxxx\"",        (string) current network name as defined in BIP70 (main, test, regtest)\n""\ninstead of\n    ""  \""chain\"": \""xxxx\"",        (string) current chain (main, testnet3, regtest)\n""\n\nbut the change in #4326 doesn't seem backwards compatible (it's goin",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4333#issuecomment-45885652,45885652,
