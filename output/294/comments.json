    "body": "Not sure if I agree with this.  Im not sure if it is useful or not.  After walletcrypter, creating new keys can be a bit slow (both created, and encrypted).  This means generating 25 in direct succession and blocking until then can generate quite a lag.  Walletcrypter will try to generate new addresses every chance it gets, as you have no idea when you will get the password again.  Even if you ignore walletcrypter, Im not sure if it is a better idea to lock once per 25 uses or for 1/25th the time on each use.\n",

I would rather see the ability, though not required, to be able to top up the keypool and not slow down my transactions.  I suppose that leads me to the answer to my original question, IMHO it is better to lag one transaction per 25, instead of 1/25th the amount per transaction.\n",
