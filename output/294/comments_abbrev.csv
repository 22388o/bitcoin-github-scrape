TheBlueMatt,2011-06-03T20:37:42Z,"Not sure if I agree with this.  Im not sure if it is useful or not.  After walletcrypter, creating new keys can be a bit slow (both created, and encrypted).  This means generating 25 in direct succession and blocking until then can generate quite a lag.  Walletcrypter will try to generate new addresses every chance it gets, as you have no idea when you will get the password again.

TheBlueMatt,2011-06-03T21:29:35Z,"My point was that after your patch, if you backup when you have 76 keys left, and you use 77, you might lose coins on restore.  However, if you backup when you have 77 keys left now...well you cant as the keypool will always have 100 new keys to use.

TheBlueMatt,2011-06-04T22:38:01Z,"Thats what I was thinking.  Im not sure what a ""good"" default keypool is.  For a merchant, you would need some ridiculously huge amount for keypool to just last a day.  For an end-user, 100 keys could very well last a month, maybe longer.
