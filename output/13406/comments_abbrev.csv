MarcoFalke,2018-06-06T16:58:33Z,Just a note that this doesn't time out due to the increase in build time: https://travis-ci.org/MarcoFalke/bitcoin/builds/388818711 (travis build with all caches wiped),https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13406#issuecomment-395140635,395140635,
ken2812221,2018-06-06T18:01:31Z,"Due to travis timeout if there is no cache, so change to another way that just add a new matrix job.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13406#issuecomment-395160223,395160223,
MarcoFalke,2018-06-06T18:29:17Z,"@ken2812221 There was *no* timeout on the mac job, so your previous solution would be fine. I have deferred this to theuni, since I am not fluent in out build system.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13406#issuecomment-395168603,395168603,
ken2812221,2018-06-06T18:36:31Z,Oh. I just saw the Linux job and misidentified it as Mac job. Thanks for clearifying. So change back to original way.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13406#issuecomment-395170726,395170726,
theuni,2018-06-12T22:19:06Z,"The purpose of ""Goal"" is that we only build towards that. Unconditionally building all would defeat that purpose.\n\nI think instead, we want to set the mac Goal to ```all deploy```.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13406#issuecomment-396752850,396752850,
