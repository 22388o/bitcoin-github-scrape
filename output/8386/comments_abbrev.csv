morcos,2016-07-21T18:38:48Z,"Can you quantify the benefit of doing this?  I don't think we should be keeping around extra fields without being sure its really worth it.  Will any significant number of miners use this instead of blockmaxweight?  In any case this is redundant with blockmaxweight until segwit is activated, so we should defer discussion of adding it until then.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8386#issuecomment-234344615,234344615,

morcos,2016-07-25T13:53:03Z,"@luke-jr I don't think we're concerned about block size on test net.\n\nBy quantifying the benefit what I meant was miners can already use blockmaxsize if they want to (although I would recommend they not), all this pull does is cache the necessary calculations.

luke-jr,2016-07-25T14:43:10Z,"Miners should not be recommended to disable blockmaxsize, since size is currently the critical constraining resource on the network. It's true that switching to blockmaxweight in 0.13.0 won't have any practical difference on mainnet, but when segwit gets activated, it will, and it is TBD whether producing blocks larger than 1 MB will be responsible at that time.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8386#issuecomment-234973690,234973690,

morcos,2016-10-03T12:49:11Z,I recently looked into this because I was worried about the default (passing no options) still using size accounting and this being potentially slow after segwit activates.  I tried to estimate how slow this might be by setting a blockmaxsize=950000 and blockmaxweight=4000000 which should cause the mining algorithm to have to trace each package adding up size all the way through the mempool.
