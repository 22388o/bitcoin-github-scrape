I can do this after this has been merged.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6958#issuecomment-154331997,154331997,
jonasschnelli,2015-11-10T12:49:29Z,Two commits that could make sense for this PR (2nd one maybe independent):\n- db504eb6ca6c85db13bb7168c2c5d48840bb97d6 ([doc] extend -maxuploadtarget release notes)\n- f6b96ce09ec827bb9be0fd926b199009dd08bfd4 ([doc] add documentation how to reduce traffic)\n\nBoth are written in my swenglish (swiss english). Feel free (or obligated) to correct and rewrite everything.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6958#issuecomment-155411910,155411910,

jonasschnelli,2015-11-06T07:13:57Z,Hmm.... i think either we take in the `MAX_BLOCK_SIZE` constant (controversial) or we drop the comment.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6958#discussion_r44109986,44109986,qa/rpc-tests/maxuploadtarget.py
