Longer term, it could be good to have a `LogPrintf()` and a `LogPrintfContinuation()`, and remove all `\n`s from the log strings. `LogPrintf()` would then prefix the log string with a newline followed by the timestamp. `LogPrintfContinuation()` would just print the log string.\n\n> That would defeat",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12887#issuecomment-378936648,378936648,
