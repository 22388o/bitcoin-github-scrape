cozz,2014-08-10T03:55:17Z,"Just saying, I am going to submit a pull for adding a new dynamic column to the transactions-list. That way you can filter and sort by watch-only. In the overviewpage, I just wrote watch-only before the address, that way its a little easier to grasp.\nThe blue color may make the watch-only txs look more important than the normal ones.\nWhat do you think?\n\n![watchonly_column1](https://cloud.githu",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4667#issuecomment-51705498,51705498,
Diapolo,2014-08-10T12:07:58Z,"@cozz I just chose blueish, because I thought watch-only should visually be different. By adding a new column this is also achieved :). But I think for adresses with and without label (watch-only) should be appended, not prepended (on the overviewpage as in tooltips). Otherwise I like your solution better.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4667#issuecomment-51713029,51713029,
