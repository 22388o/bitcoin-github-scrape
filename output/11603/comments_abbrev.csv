laanwj,2017-11-06T09:07:34Z,"> Does this break using the in-Qt RPC console when running without -server?\n\nWhops - it appears the logic is wrong there currently. Qt debug console is considered a front-end for RPC, just like libevent/HTTP.\nSo `StartRPC` is definitely supposed to be called when Qt's debug console is active. Same for the `OnRPCStarted` `OnRPCStopped` registrations in InitServers, probably.\nIt's just the H",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11603#issuecomment-342086939,342086939,

laanwj,2017-11-07T07:13:52Z,"> Would it be ok to move it above?\n\nYes - constraint is that StartRPC needs to be called before StartHTTPRPC - the relative order of InitHTTPServer and StartRPC shouldn't matter because the parts don't 'know' each other at that point.\n\n> Also it seems like the http server is not started at all if -rest is disabled. Is that intentional?\n\nI'm fairly sure that's not true in master, we'd h",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11603#issuecomment-342395503,342395503,

laanwj,2017-11-09T08:20:13Z,That's very rarely used. It doesn't hurt to register the commands anyway. If that helps keep the code simpler (esp. we don't want UI specific workarounds in core code).,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11603#discussion_r149890180,149890180,src/init.cpp
