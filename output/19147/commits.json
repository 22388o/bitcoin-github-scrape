      "message": "Document discouragement logic with regards to malicious exploitation.\n\nByond cases where an attacker is sending invalid data to a honest\npeer and those one relaying it forward therefore provoking its\ntemporary disconnection, a direct impersonation is possible. An\nattacker can directly sends invalid data spoofing IP address of a\nhonest reachable peer. Such scenario assumes infrastructure capabilites\nand therefore would benefit from mitigations against infrastructure\nattacks with same threat model (e.g Erebus).",
