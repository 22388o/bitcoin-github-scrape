paveljanik,2016-09-01T14:03:10Z,"The change in src/net.h is unclear (at least to me ;-), even in the current tree. What is the purpose of the line https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/net.h#L291? Assigning to a shadowed variable which is not used at all down below this assignment is strange... It has no meaning in READ, it has no meaning in WRITE.\n\nIIRC we had a short talk about this on IRC with @laanwj a few days",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8468#issuecomment-244088542,244088542,

laanwj,2016-09-30T17:50:08Z,"> Binaries are not the same\n\nIndeed. Either with `-O2` or without, there are binary differences.\nThe following functions are affected:\n\n```\nvoid CBanEntry::SerializationOp<CDataStream, CSerActionSerialize>(CDataStream&, CSerActionSerialize, int, int)\nvoid CBanEntry::SerializationOp<CDataStream, CSerActionUnserialize>(CDataStream&, CSerActionUnserialize, int, int)\nvoid CBlockHeader::Seriali",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8468#issuecomment-250808906,250808906,
theuni,2016-10-20T16:23:39Z,"It appears as though the changes come from the fact that the passed variable is now unused. Presumably the compiler notices that and doesn't bother copying.\n\n@paveljanik Rather than passing _nVersion in the unused case, could you just leave the variable unnamed instead? That will also cut down on the ""unused parameter"" warnings, should we ever decide to enable those.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8468#issuecomment-255155774,255155774,

sipa,2016-10-29T23:40:37Z,"I don't think it's feasible to get the same binary with this kind of changes.
