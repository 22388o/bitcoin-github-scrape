laanwj,2014-02-17T15:19:01Z,Why are you naming the spacers specifically? We never refer to them. This is really over-doing things. If you keep them at the default spacer1 2 3 names you never have to rename them.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3693#discussion_r9794497,9794497,src/qt/forms/optionsdialog.ui

laanwj,2014-02-17T15:35:24Z,"So if you rename them anyway, please just name them verticalLayout / verticalLayout2 / etc and remove the _Wallet _Network part. Naming them specifically just gives extra maintenance (and review) effort without a good reason. Same for the label change below.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3693#discussion_r9795064,9795064,src/qt/forms/optionsdialog.ui
