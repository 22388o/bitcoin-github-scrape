MarcoFalke,2019-11-26 13:49:33,For some reason this is one of the fastest machines on travis. Installing all packages only took 49 seconds (instead of minutes) and a build from scratch + unit tests + functional tests ran in 15 minutes. I'd argue that we should switch all native builds to run on that architecture instead of amd64.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17599#issuecomment-558636586,558636586,

MarcoFalke,2019-12-03 15:35:15,@elichai Sweet. Looks like you fixed a bug in our depends qt build. So a fresh PR might be the best.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17599#issuecomment-561221891,561221891,
