sipa,2014-06-29T14:45:01Z,"It's unfortunate that util depends on uint256, otherwise this could go to\ncommon lib instead of util lib.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4437#issuecomment-47456734,47456734,
laanwj,2014-06-29T14:52:44Z,@sipa Maybe after #4400 it could. AFAIK bitcoin-cli doesn't use any random functionality.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4437#issuecomment-47456940,47456940,
jgarzik,2014-06-29T15:03:59Z,"@sipa @laanwj Trivial to fix.  Current master only shows util.{h,cpp} needing uint256 in a single function: GetRandHash()  ""Rand"" stuff should arguably move to crypto/ anyway.  Problem solved.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4437#issuecomment-47457198,47457198,
jgarzik,2014-06-29T15:05:14Z,"Also, #4332 adds the core_{read,write} modules as a home for converting from hex/json-to-core data structure (and the reverse direction).  Some hex parsing can be moved there, or to a separate hex module.  \n\nShrink util.  :)\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4437#issuecomment-47457231,47457231,
laanwj,2014-06-29T15:20:24Z,"@jgarzik yes, see #4400. It moves the Rand stuff to a separate file. We decided not to move it to crypto because it still relies on OpenSSL but that could be done at a later time.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4437#issuecomment-47457650,47457650,
