TheBlueMatt,2017-04-28T15:17:33Z,"No, I dont believe so, in a crazy case you may have started shutdown (possibly due to stopatheight), and then gotten another call into ActivateBestChain(), which will break out of the main loop at the first chance it gets, and then blow up.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10290#discussion_r113954232,113954232,src/validation.cpp
