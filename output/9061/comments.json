    "body": "And in response to @gmaxwell https://botbot.me/freenode/bitcoin-core-dev/msg/75840350/ - this PR reduces the DoS effect you refer to - i.e. it ignores FEWER getheaders than previously.\n\nHowever I do agree that ignoring getheaders is not ideal - I believe the node should disconnect when it decides to ignore a getheaders request. I didn't add this though, as it wasn't already in the code, for some reason I do not understand.\n",
