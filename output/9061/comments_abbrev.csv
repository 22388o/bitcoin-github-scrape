rebroad,2016-11-02T05:29:20Z,"@dcousens A nice idea, but this change is to fix the concerns raised here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5927#issuecomment-104665085 which requires it to be linked to the last checkpoint. For some reason additional criteria got added too that made it too strict.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9061#issuecomment-257776232,257776232,
laanwj,2016-11-02T14:27:01Z,"Instead of adding more reliance on checkpoints, we should be getting rid of them (see #7591). @gmaxwell has work in progress to do this (#9053 is part of that).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9061#issuecomment-257880224,257880224,
gmaxwell,2016-11-02T16:49:15Z,NAK. No more reliance on checkpoints.  Also-- IsInitialBlockDownload does a fine job here AFAIK-- this is literally its job (esp with my changes that are less likely to let it get tripped up on testnet with headers forked).\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9061#issuecomment-257925315,257925315,

MarcoFalke,2016-11-03T09:10:42Z,"@rebroad Please, this is not an argument.\n\nBecause something was done in the past does not mean it is correct and encouraged forever. Often we keep code that works (but relies on bad pratices) because no one found time to fix it... I don't see a way where we restore the checkpoint functionality you are referencing in this pull.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9061#issuecomment-258092520,258092520,
