mrbandrews,2014-12-04T21:51:44Z,"There's an open issue, #4071, suggesting porting certain tests over, and it seemed like a decent way to get familiar with the subject matter as a new contributor.   \n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5427#issuecomment-65710217,65710217,

laanwj,2014-12-05T06:30:34Z,"Nice. Yes, one of the goals is to port the tests to Python, so that a) they're written in a common language b) theyre not just a bunch of hacky shell scripts that fail on half the machines due to silly path problems.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5427#issuecomment-65752696,65752696,

kanzure,2014-12-04T21:37:16Z,Could these comments be put into a docstring instead? Importing the file will then reveal these comments in `__doc__`.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5427#discussion_r21338078,21338078,qa/rpc-tests/walletbackup.py
kanzure,2014-12-04T21:39:18Z,"nit: line 40 is not very pep8-friendly (even if spacing here is not explicitly defined in pep8). But flake8 or some other pep8-compatible linter isn't being used yet anyway, so you could probably get away this....\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5427#discussion_r21338202,21338202,qa/rpc-tests/walletbackup.py
kanzure,2014-12-04T21:40:53Z,"Regarding print statements, two thoughts come to mind:\n\n1) Use `print()` so that the file is python3-compatible. I think this will be the only required change, so it's an easy win.\n\n2) An alternative is to not use print at all, and instead use `import logging` and then enable logging to stdout: https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5427#discussion_r21338306,21338306,qa/rpc-tests/walletbackup.py
