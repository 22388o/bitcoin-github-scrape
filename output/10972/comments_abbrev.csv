gmaxwell,2017-08-04T08:16:26Z,This looks like it will be an instant crash if you put a P2SH address in the field.   ,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10972#issuecomment-320187442,320187442,
practicalswift,2017-08-04T08:30:59Z,"@gmaxwell Thanks for reviewing and clarifying that the old code does not assume `addr.GetKeyID(keyid)` being `true`.\n\nI've now changed to `if (!valid || !model->havePrivKey(keyid)) { â€¦ }` for the unknown change address code path - looks good? :-)",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10972#issuecomment-320190501,320190501,
