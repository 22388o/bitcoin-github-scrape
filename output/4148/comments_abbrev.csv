sipa,2014-05-22T11:37:16Z,"Nice catch. However, chainActive should never be modified anywhere but in the thread calling this method (the message handler), so it can't be the cause for the segfault i observed (perhaps #4204 fixed it, though). I'll fix it.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4148#discussion_r12945589,12945589,src/main.cpp
