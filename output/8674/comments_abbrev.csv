fanquake,2016-09-07T02:18:21Z,I'm not sure that maintaining copyright headers is such an issue that it warrants splitting one tool into three. Interested in other opinions.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8674#issuecomment-245155278,245155278,
MarcoFalke,2016-09-07T17:30:53Z,"Agree with @fanquake: I'd prefer to have the functionality (report and update) in a single script.\n\n Also, I don't think **copyright_header_insert.py** is required.

isle2983,2016-09-08T01:31:59Z,I have condensed the three files into one and made them subcommands:\n\n```\n$ ./copyright_header_report.py <base_directory> [verbose]\n$ ./copyright_header_update.py <base_directory>\n$ ./copyright_header_report.py <file>\n```\n\nbecomes:\n\n```\n$ ./copyright_header.py report <base_directory> [verbose]\n$ ./copyright_header.py update <base_directory>\n$ ./copyright_header.py insert <file>\n```\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8674#issuecomment-245469217,245469217,

isle2983,2016-12-21T02:54:00Z,"Good question.\n\nI have a working branch that hooks it into TravisCI to fail branches that are missing copyright headers - forcing the submitter to either add them or to manually exclude the file from the check.
