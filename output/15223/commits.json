        "patch": "@@ -5,6 +5,85 @@ The headless daemon `bitcoind` has the JSON-RPC API enabled by default, the GUI\n option. In the GUI it is possible to execute RPC methods in the Debug Console\n Dialog.\n \n+## Security\n+\n+The RPC interface allows other programs to control Bitcoin Core,\n+including the ability to spend funds from your wallets, affect consensus\n+verification, read private data, and otherwise perform operations that\n+can cause loss of money, data, or privacy.  This section suggests how\n+you should use and configure Bitcoin Core to reduce the risk that its\n+RPC interface will be abused.\n+\n+- **Securing the executable:** Anyone with physical or remote access to\n+  the computer, container, or virtual machine running Bitcoin Core can\n+  compromise either the whole program or just the RPC interface.  This\n+  includes being able to record any passphrases you enter for unlocking\n+  your encrypted wallets or changing settings so that your Bitcoin Core\n+  program tells you that certain transactions have multiple\n+  confirmations even when they aren't part of the best block chain.  For\n+  this reason, you should not use Bitcoin Core for security sensitive\n+  operations on systems you do not exclusively control, such as shared\n+  computers or virtual private servers.\n+\n+- **Securing local network access:** By default, the RPC interface can\n+  only be accessed by a client running on the same computer and only\n+  after the client provides a valid authentication credential (username\n+  and passphrase).  Any program on your computer with access to the file\n+  system and local network can obtain this level of access.\n+  Additionally, other programs on your computer can attempt to provide\n+  an RPC interface on the same port as used by Bitcoin Core in order to\n+  trick you into revealing your authentication credentials.  For this\n+  reason, it is important to only use Bitcoin Core for\n+  security-sensitive operations on a computer whose other programs you\n+  trust.\n+\n+- **Securing remote network access:** You may optionally allow other\n+  computers to remotely control Bitcoin Core by setting the `rpcallowip`\n+  and `rpcbind` configuration parameters.  These settings are only meant\n+  for enabling connections over secure private networks or connections\n+  that have been otherwise secured (e.g. using a VPN or port forwarding\n+  with SSH or stunnel).  **Do not enable RPC connections over the public\n+  Internet.**  Although Bitcoin Core's RPC interface does use\n+  authentication, it does not use encryption, so your login credentials\n+  are sent as clear text that can be read by anyone on your network\n+  path.  Additionally, the RPC interface has not been hardened to\n+  withstand arbitrary Internet traffic, so changing the above settings\n+  to expose it to the Internet (even using something like a Tor hidden\n+  service) could expose you to unconsidered vulnerabilities.  See\n+  `bitcoind -help` for more information about these settings and other\n+  settings described in this document.\n+\n+    Related, if you use Bitcoin Core inside a Docker container, you may\n+    need to expose the RPC port to the host system.  The default way to\n+    do this in Docker also exposes the port to the public Internet.\n+    Instead, expose it only on the host system's localhost, for example:\n+    `-p 127.0.0.1:8332:8332`\n+\n+- **Secure authentication:** By default, Bitcoin Core generates unique\n+  login credentials each time it restarts and puts them into a file\n+  readable only by the user that started Bitcoin Core, allowing any of\n+  that user's RPC clients with read access to the file to login\n+  automatically.  The file is `.cookie` in the Bitcoin Core\n+  configuration directory, and using these credentials is the preferred\n+  RPC authentication method.  If you need to generate static login\n+  credentials for your programs, you can use the script in the\n+  `share/rpcauth` directory in the Bitcoin Core source tree.  As a final\n+  fallback, you can directly use manually-chosen `rpcuser` and\n+  `rpcpassword` configuration parameters---but you must ensure that you\n+  choose a strong and unique passphrase (and still don't use insecure\n+  networks, as mentioned above).\n+\n+- **Secure string handling:** The RPC interface does not guarantee any\n+  escaping of data beyond what's necessary to encode it as JSON,\n+  although it does usually provide serialized data using a hex\n+  representation of the bytes.  If you use RPC data in your programs or\n+  provide its data to other programs, you must ensure any problem\n+  strings are properly escaped.  For example, multiple websites have\n+  been manipulated because they displayed decoded hex strings that\n+  included HTML `<script>` tags.  For this reason, and other\n+  non-security reasons, it is recommended to display all serialized data\n+  in hex form only.\n+\n ## RPC consistency guarantees\n \n State that can be queried via RPCs is guaranteed to be at least up-to-date with"
