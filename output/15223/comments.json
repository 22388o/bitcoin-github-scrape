    "body": "@andronoob not for RPC, because (non ancient) browsers will refuse to communicate due to lacking CORS headers. Electrum, from I remember, does have those CORS headers, because it consists of a \"server\" and a (javascript based) GUI \"client\". The problem there was that not just the client could talk to the server, but any website could. \r\n  \r\nBecause of these missing headers, websites can't communicate with the RPC. Even if they could, they would need to know the username & password.\r\n\r\nThere's also a REST API which is unauthenticated, but only shows public info like blocks; it doesn't expose the wallet. It currently doesn't have CORS headers and probably shouldn't, but not so much for security reasons as for scope creep. See the discussion in #12040 for more context.",

If you need to generate\n+static login credentials for your programs, you can use the script in\n+the `share/rpcauth` directory in the Bitcoin Core source tree.  As a\n+final fallback, you can directly use manually-chosen `rpcuser` and\n+`rpcpassword` configuration parameters---but you must ensure that you\n+choose a strong and unique passphrase (and still don't use insecure\n+networks, as mentioned above).\n+\n+The RPC interface does not guarantee any escaping of data beyond what's",

    "diff_hunk": "@@ -5,6 +5,85 @@ The headless daemon `bitcoind` has the JSON-RPC API enabled by default, the GUI\n option. In the GUI it is possible to execute RPC methods in the Debug Console\n Dialog.\n \n+## Security\n+\n+The RPC interface allows other programs to control Bitcoin Core,\n+including the ability to spend funds from your wallets, affect consensus\n+verification, read private data, and otherwise perform operations that\n+can cause loss of money, data, or privacy.  This section suggests how\n+you should use and configure Bitcoin Core to reduce the risk that its\n+RPC interface will be abused.\n+\n+- **Securing the executable:** Anyone with physical or remote access to\n+  the computer, container, or virtual machine running Bitcoin Core can\n+  compromise either the whole program or just the RPC interface.  This\n+  includes being able to record any passphrases you enter for unlocking\n+  your encrypted wallets or changing settings so that your Bitcoin Core\n+  program tells you that certain transactions have multiple\n+  confirmations even when they aren't part of the best block chain.  For\n+  this reason, you should not use Bitcoin Core for security sensitive\n+  operations on systems you do not exclusively control, such as shared\n+  computers or virtual private servers.\n+\n+- **Securing local network access:** By default, the RPC interface can\n+  only be accessed by a client running on the same computer and only\n+  after the client provides a valid authentication credential (username\n+  and passphrase).  Any program on your computer with access to the file\n+  system and local network can obtain this level of access.\n+  Additionally, other programs on your computer can attempt to provide\n+  an RPC interface on the same port as used by Bitcoin Core in order to\n+  trick you into revealing your authentication credentials.  For this\n+  reason, it is important to only use Bitcoin Core for\n+  security-sensitive operations on a computer whose other programs you\n+  trust.\n+\n+- **Securing remote network access:** You may optionally allow other\n+  computers to remotely control Bitcoin Core by setting the `rpcallowip`\n+  and `rpcbind` configuration parameters.  These settings are only meant\n+  for enabling connections over secure private networks or connections\n+  that have been otherwise secured (e.g. using a VPN or ssh port",
