ryanofsky,2019-07-31 21:12:37,"As a change to selectively change the current double-negative warnings into errors, I think this PR is well put together, but I think a simpler alternative to this would be to forbid the double-negative syntax entirely.\n\nTo take an example, I think we should only support negation syntax like `-noupnp` and `-noupnp=1`, and that we should start treating `-noupnp=0`, `-noupnp=23`, and `-noupnp=je",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16508#issuecomment-517023050,517023050,

ryanofsky,2019-08-01 12:38:45,"> From my point of view, this PR is a milestone on the road which begins with #16097. The end goal is to replace all ArgsManager::ALLOW_ANY flags with proper type flag(s). IMO, disabling double negation syntax for non-boolean args is a pretty bonus feature in this PR.\n\n@hebasto, I agree with your goal, but think this is a bad approach.
