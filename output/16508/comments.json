    "body": "> From my point of view, this PR is a milestone on the road which begins with #16097. The end goal is to replace all ArgsManager::ALLOW_ANY flags with proper type flag(s). IMO, disabling double negation syntax for non-boolean args is a pretty bonus feature in this PR.\r\n\r\n@hebasto, I agree with your goal, but think this is a bad approach. I want to get to the same place as you, but I don't want to do it by repeatedly tweaking behavior in complicated ways that no reviewer or no user will be able to keep track of. I want to change behavior in straightforward PR's that are understandable by normal reviewers and understandable by users who are _affected_ by these changes. \r\n\r\nInternal code cleanups should happen separately from behavior changes for two reasons:\r\n\r\n1) **It makes PR vastly easier to review.** When I'm reviewing a refactoring PR, all I have to ask myself is two questions. Do the changes affect behavior, and do these changes improve the code? When you mix in behavior changes, there's a combinatoric explosion of other questions that get added. Is this the part of the change that changes behavior or is this other part responsible? Is this behavior change good? Is the behavior change limited to what's described or does it have other side effects? Is it good but will it break existing use cases? Is it good but could it be implemented in a simpler way? Is the behavior a stable endpoint, or does it put us in some weird intermediate state that's going to be changed again later in a confusing way?\r\n\r\n2) **It ensures the reviews will actually be meaningful.** People who are interested in a fix or feature will be able to understand and comment on the behavior changes without getting lost in sea of refactoring. People who are familiar and interested in the particular area of code can discuss structure and maintenance and get PRs merged more quickly because they have _limited scope_.\r\n\r\nFor this PR, if you **aren't** actually interested making the described behavior change, I think you should just close this and move test / refactoring parts to #16097, and save changing flags for some future PR that implement behavior changes which you actually believe are beneficial to users. If you **are** interested in this behavior change, and think it benefits users, I would suggest forbidding double negatives in the simpler (maybe one-line) change I suggested previously.",
