    "body": "> What is the rationale for renaming -usewallet to -wallet (over just rejecting duplicate -usewallet and/or -defaultwallet)?\r\n\r\nFrom my point of view I think the consistency is good. If we just have a consistent \"-wallet=filename\" option accepted by `bitcoind`, `bitcoin-qt`, `bitcoin-cli` tools, it is harder to screw up using them. Especially if we want to have support for default wallets like Greg wants, it seems like asking for trouble expecting users to remember \"-usewallet\" instead of \"-wallet\" on the command line for this one tool, and punishing them if they forget by not showing any error and falling back to another wallet written in some config file.",

    "body": "After some offline discussion with @jnewbery, Concept ACK. I misunderstood how little effect \"ignore the config file\" had on the semantics of -wallet.\r\n\r\nI believe the behaviour of the -wallet option can effectively be modelled as \"the command-line -wallet arguments replace the config file ones as a whole, rather than appending to them\". I think that's fine. Ideally, I think that interpretation can be extended slightly further, by making `bitcoin-cli` use (all) `wallet=` lines from the config if no `-wallet` is provided on the cmdline.\r\n\r\nHaving a `-defaultwallet` can be an independent feature that is added later, or not.",

    "body": "Sounds good. I'm happy with this PR as it is, as well as the other options that have been discussed. Note that the current PR doesn't exactly model command line -wallet options \"replacing config file ones as a whole\", because it clears config wallet options even when no command line option specified. The change I was talking about earlier would give you that behavior (and potentially less safe results when bitcoind and bitcoin-cli read different config files).

Having two identical arguments that have total different effects is not ideal (even cross binaries).\r\n\r\nI think for 0.15 we should merge the multiple `-usewallet` arguments blocker: #10867 \r\n\r\nAlso, if we want to go with a default wallet (in future and we already do this for Qt [Index 0]), we could reuse the `-usewallet` argument for the daemon and/or-only Qt.",

    "body": "> If he forgets the use prefix and uses -wallet instead, the call would not be executed in multiwallet environment because he had not specified a wallet.\r\n\r\nYes, that is what I meant by \"-wallet=filename is ignored by bitcoin-cli, resulting in server error or the RPC call ignoring specified filename and accessing wrong wallet if server configured with a different single wallet.\" The worse case of the two is the case where server is single wallet and filename provided just gets silently ignored instead of checked on the server. Anyway, even if we disagree about how bad it is for bitcoin-cli to silently ignore \"-wallet\" options, I think we can agree that in the most common use-case (calling bitcoin-cli with a wallet filename on command line and no custom default config), having differently spelled `-usewallet` and `-wallet` arguments that get used by some commands and ignored by others does add some new opportunities for confusion and errors even if we disagree about how bad the confusion and errors are. And in any case (I will explain below) adding confusion to command line interface to support a default wallet feature is unnecessary.\r\n\r\n> I don't think we should avoid setting a default wallet via -usewallet in bitcoin.conf, this seems to me after a desirable use-cases and, because it's different to -wallet and has the term -use in it, I think its acceptable.\r\n\r\nI agree that being able to set default wallet is useful. All I'm saying is that better way to do it is to call the default wallet option `-defaultwallet` instead of `-usewallet` and implement it server side instead of client side. Implementing it server side would have advantage of working with clients other than `bitcoin-cli`. It would avoid adding unnecessary complexity to command line in the common case where it isn't used, and avoid the complicated interactions you described in your five bullet points when it is used. Finally, it could interact better with per-user default wallets (which are necessarily implemented server-side) which luke-jr at least has mentioned use cases for if we decide to add support for them in the future.",

With singlewallet mode, everything runs exactly as before. With non-wallet RPCs, everything runs exactly as before.

How do they know that `usewallet` in .conf means *default wallet* and on the command line means *override default wallet*? How do they know that `usewallet` is the default wallet if you're using bitcoin-cli but there is no default wallet if you're using RPC over HTTP?

    "body": "I prefer not to overload `-wallet` both for bitcoind, which has \"what wallets to load\", and bitcoin-cli which has \"what wallet to choose\".\r\nThese meanings are different enough. Also one option is multi-value, the other single-value. This requires special casing to make work, which I don't think is worth it.\r\n(if bitcoind and bitcoin-cli read different configuration files, this issue wouldn't exist as there would be no overlap in namespaces - but alas)\r\n\r\nThe current approach of introducing a new argument name for bitcoin-cli to select the wallet (now `-rpcwallet`) has less potential of confusing, and doesn't require special casing of argument handling, so is preferable to me.",

    "body": "I still don't understand why `-rpcwallet` is preferred. bitcoind is a node where `-wallet` means \"this is the wallet I wish to use\". Since 0.15, multiple wallets are allowed. bitcoin-cli is a command line interface where `wallet` would mean \"this is the wallet I wish to issue a command to\". Obviously only one `wallet` can be used in this context. So yes, perhaps this is a little bit overloaded, but only in the most intuitive and expected way.\r\n\r\nAs for special-casing, the only way `wallet` is treated functionally differently is that in bitcoin-cli a `wallet` on the command-line *overrides* `wallet` in .conf, but for bitcoind `wallet` on the command-line *appends* to the `wallets` in bitcoin.conf. That's really the only way it could work, since appending doesn't make sense for bitcoin-cli where only one `wallet` is allowed.\r\n\r\n(and FWIW, command-line arguments *appending* to .conf arguments instead of replacing them is very counter-intuitive)\r\n\r\nBut yes, you're right - the decision has been made.
