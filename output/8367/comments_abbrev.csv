TheBlueMatt,2016-07-19T01:53:36Z,"This might complicate future wallet changes...it seems to me that this locks us in such that the next change to wallet version must either be the same non-default or we will, at that time, have to force hd wallets to be the default. I'm not strictly aginst this, just noting that it seems it was not at all discussed but locks us into a future path.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8367#issuecomment-233509560,233509560,
jonasschnelli,2016-07-19T05:24:09Z,Thanks Matt for the review.\nI agree.\n\nWe could change `FEATURE_HD` to `FEATURE_FLAGS` and store a set of string in wallet.dat in this case.\n\nSee the relevant discussion:\nhttps://botbot.me/freenode/bitcoin-core-dev/2016-07-18/?msg=69815345&page=1\n\nWorking on a PR that could be an alternative for this one.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8367#issuecomment-233535301,233535301,
laanwj,2016-07-19T09:54:05Z,"@TheBlueMatt Right - we've discussed a better system to handle wallet versioning and features in the future. The current system is sub-par.\nHowever for now we need this, it is important for consistency that wallets which have HD enabled aren't used with older releases.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8367#issuecomment-233584943,233584943,

TheBlueMatt,2016-07-19T19:16:57Z,I did not mean to imply that I think this is bad...In fact I prefer this to doing something complicated like adding feature flags significantly. Just felt it needed pointing out that this locks in our future options (though why did we not fix the write-order prior to merge???)\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8367#issuecomment-233736788,233736788,
TheBlueMatt,2016-07-19T01:54:25Z,"I think this call should go above SetHDMasterKey...cant have it crash in between and leave the wallet with an HD seed but no minversion set (not that it really matters, but, you know....)\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8367#discussion_r71261800,71261800,src/wallet/wallet.cpp
MarcoFalke,2016-07-19T19:27:46Z,This is dead code. You might as well remove it.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8367#discussion_r71406686,71406686,src/wallet/wallet.cpp
MarcoFalke,2016-07-19T20:00:46Z,Also the strings in the exceptions have the wrong function names. (Here as well as SetHDMasterKey())\n\nMight as well  rework exceptions/return values for those?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8367#discussion_r71412176,71412176,src/wallet/wallet.cpp
