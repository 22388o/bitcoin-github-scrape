MarcoFalke,2020-03-06 14:07:56,"The OP says ""all call locale dependent functions"", the title says ""locale independence"". Which is correct?\n\nWhat is the point of a test that tests the functions are not locale independent?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18126#issuecomment-595783122,595783122,
practicalswift,2020-03-06 15:37:25,@MarcoFalke They all call functions that are known to be locale dependent (see list in [lint-locale-dependence.sh](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/test/lint/lint-locale-dependence.sh)) but they are supposed to do so in a way that guarantees that their own output is locale independent. Does that answer your question? :),https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18126#issuecomment-595823732,595823732,
