sdaftuar,2016-07-05T19:57:42Z,"I added a warning if `-blockminsize` is given on the command line, as we discussed on IRC last week, so this PR is now ready for review.\n\n@laanwj I left the string for the warning untranslated because we're past the string freeze for translations for 0.13.0, but I wasn't sure if that was the right thing to do?  Not sure what your preference is for how we display the warning.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8295#issuecomment-230585241,230585241,
sipa,2016-07-11T18:04:16Z,"ACK c1d61fbd080bcc29589b8d467df98efb7e89d231, that was easier than I had anticipated (I thought we'd need to add size-based accounting to the mempool, but only a per-package check is needed).\n\nAlso nice to see AddScoreTx disappear. This also means that the existing mining tests now all test the only remaining algorithm.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8295#issuecomment-231815332,231815332,
