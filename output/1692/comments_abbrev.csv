laanwj,2012-09-04T16:27:16Z,"I don't see the point of creating an extra function here. Instead of the fairly simple expression `(GetDataDir() / strprintf(""blk%04d.dat"", nFile)).string()`, used in one place, you add a 20 line function that is only used in one place.\n\nAlso, please don't introduce any snprintf and fixed buffers. `strprintf` exists for a reason.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1692#issuecomment-8269422,8269422,

Diapolo,2012-09-04T16:39:18Z,"@laanwj Sorry for my over-reacting, had a little trouble at work today. You are right, it can be even shorter and if you want I can use strprintf (although snprintf() has a buffer-length check afaik).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1692#issuecomment-8269863,8269863,
laanwj,2012-09-04T16:46:28Z,"No hard feelings. We all have that kind of trouble sometimes.\n\nsnprintf checks the buffer length, that's right, but has some problems that can catch the unwary. Ie, the resulting buffer is not necessarily zero-terminated. And what if someone changes the filename and forgets to change the hardcoded '12'... For a project like bitcoin we should prefer clarity and robustness to low-level fiddling. E",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1692#issuecomment-8270131,8270131,
Diapolo,2012-09-04T17:06:15Z,"@laanwj You are absolutely right then, `strprintf()` is the function to take ... I'm just interested, was it deeply inspected for any faults / security flaws in it's implementation, as I find it rather strange to trust a hand-made function that much :) or even more than standard functions.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1692#issuecomment-8270815,8270815,
laanwj,2012-09-04T17:18:56Z,"We use strprintf all over the codebase, so it is fairly well-tested. Personally I've looked at it many times and wasn't able to find issues with it. Internally it ofcourse simply calls (_v)snprintf, but handles all the edge cases as well. It is also the only place where we call the ""evil"" *snprintf directly, and I'd like to keep it that way.\n\nIf you don't trust strprintf please try to study it c",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1692#issuecomment-8271253,8271253,
