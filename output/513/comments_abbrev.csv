TheBlueMatt,2011-09-12T14:43:03Z,"ACK (if its in one commit).\nFor reference, Bitcoin releases are already built with -fstack-protector (not -fstack-protector-all, however the difference is negligible), -Wl,-z,relro (though not -Wl,-z,now due to its potential performance hit at initial load, something which is minor compared to existing load times), and -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 simply because those are the default for Ubuntu 10.04.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/513#issuecomment-2071301,2071301,
