My\npurpose was making sure that the average eventual connection durations are\napproximately exponentially distributed: causing a few connection slots to\nrotate frequently, but also maintain longer connrction times with some.

dgenr8,2014-08-30T19:34:38Z,"@gmaxwell: yes, I am offering the counterpoint.  Today, a sybil attacker can know pretty well when she owns a node's world (introduce a test tx on an uncontrolled node and see if owned node relays it).  So she knows a fresh attack (via whatever vector) is needed when she gets disconnected.  If disconnects happen more commonly, this gets more expensive.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4723#issuecomment-53968242,53968242,

ivanpustogarov,2015-05-19T21:40:13Z,Sorry for being silent. I was busy with other stuff.\nIt looks like this change might solve one problem but create others\n(e.g. as gmaxwell mentioned the partitioning attack if there are no\nlong term connections).\nSo I think more research should be done in this direction.\nUnfortunately I don't have enough time now to work on this.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4723#issuecomment-103675177,103675177,
