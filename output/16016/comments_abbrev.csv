jnewbery,2019-06-19 21:11:45,@jonatack - the commit that adds the test has been added to #15996. Are you happy to close this PR now? (you can either open a PR for the tidy-up commits or just drop them),https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16016#issuecomment-503748228,503748228,
jonatack,2019-06-19 21:26:20,@jnewbery Sure. My intent was to update the tests to not use totalFee but can do it in a separate PR and not divert further review time.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16016#issuecomment-503752867,503752867,
