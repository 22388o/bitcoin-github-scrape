jtimon,2015-11-10T22:39:29Z,"@MarcoFalke Yes, it is not critical. In fact, just removing the unused declaration in main.h (unused because it's a different function from the one defined in .cpp, even if the name it's the same, that's why the mistake didn't break anything) would also solve it. Which makes me think...should I also make the function static (the change would be +3 -5 instead of +5 -5)?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6982#issuecomment-155590613,155590613,
