laanwj,2012-09-22T09:59:20Z,Shouldn't we do the same for QMenu?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1853#discussion_r1667546,1667546,src/qt/macdockiconhandler.mm
fanquake,2012-09-22T10:15:01Z,I don't think so. The reason the QWidget gets changed is because in Qt 5 compared to Qt 4 widgets have been split from the QtGui module into a new QtWidgets module.\n\nSee here http://www.kdab.com/porting-from-qt-4-to-qt-5/ under fixing up includes.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1853#discussion_r1667552,1667552,src/qt/macdockiconhandler.mm
Diapolo,2012-09-22T10:18:25Z,As I understand it @fanquake should be right here.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1853#discussion_r1667556,1667556,src/qt/macdockiconhandler.mm
laanwj,2012-09-22T10:47:36Z,Hmm but in other places in the source code we always simply use `#include <QMenu>`. So I guess it would be more consistent.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1853#discussion_r1667570,1667570,src/qt/macdockiconhandler.mm
