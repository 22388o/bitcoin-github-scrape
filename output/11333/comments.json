In the context of `GetMedianTimePast()`, you don't really care about the exact time type. Therefore, using `auto*` better reflects the semantics needed in the context of the function.",

I personally would prefer that it not get used for simple types like `int64_t`.\r\n\r\nThe project doesn't have style guidelines for `auto`. Changing existing, functioning code to match your personal preferences seems unnecessary.",

    "body": "FWIW, I was in the process of writing something pretty much like sipa's suggestion in english (though using std::begin())-- with the suggestion of reducing the very C-ish references to array members and pointer arithmetic.   (Also.. comma operator? meh....)\r\n\r\nAs far as the use of auto:  The principle I think we prefer to follow is that explicit is better than implicit, except where explicit creates a ton of noise or breaks generality--e.g. in a template; or deals with a far-away defined type making changes have to happen in many places. If those things aren't true, we prefer explicitness.    \r\n\r\nI'm a fan of using the nth element in a cleanup like sipa suggests.  I think that code is easy enough to review and test (I would just try all n! inputs of c*1-n for n [1..11] and a number of c values and make sure it gives the same results; or something similar which is almost exhaustive)",

If the code is unclear please add a comment instead.\r\n\r\nThis seems to be the opinion of many other people here as well. Hence I'm closing this. I'd say there are more important priorities, too.\r\n",

    "body": "@gmaxwell @laanwj Explicit is better than implicit in this context when you want to commit to a type. If what you're interested in doing is just tracking a type, it is a violation of DRY.\r\n\r\nIn the consensus code, I think there's a trade-off. You can re-commit to types as you go, but that makes the code less concise and more resistant to change, and as a consequence *less* secure, IMHO. The advantage of re-committing to types everywhere is similar to adding asserts - you wouldn't stick asserts everywhere, but you would at junctions where you think they would matter, or you're afraid of mistakes.\r\n\r\nI can speak to this advantage of not using `auto` from my own personal experience of writing DSP code, where `double`s and `float`s often mix together and using `auto` would be bug-prone - that's a case where I often want to commit to types, since I don't trust myself to get the type tracking right, so I'm insuring myself against my own bugs.\r\n\r\nHowever, if I had to, e.g., `std::sort` an array of `double`s, I wouldn't hesitate to get `auto` pointers to it, since there is no fear of any mixup. If I later change the array to `float`s, the sorting would still work fine.\r\n\r\n@sipa @gmaxwell I suppose the code intentionally initializes the vector in reverse order, so it is likely to be already sorted or close to sorted (since later blocks will tend to have later times), so the following `std::sort` takes less time. Does that make sense? I agree the loop could still probably be simplified.",

Which is also a helpful signal that you're being careless.
