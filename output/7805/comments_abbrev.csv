sipa,2016-04-04T22:19:08Z,"@gmaxwell As long as we intend to support serving blocks to pre-0.10 (and especially 0.9 with the limited block orphan pools), we should not reorder block invs.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7805#issuecomment-205520313,205520313,
theuni,2016-04-04T23:32:01Z,Concept ACK. Nit: looks like most of these functions should be const.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7805#issuecomment-205540738,205540738,
gmaxwell,2016-04-05T17:20:04Z,Updated to make the sort stable and use static variables.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7805#issuecomment-205906173,205906173,

sipa,2016-04-07T10:36:26Z,"Midly-tested ACK using https://github.com/sipa/bitcoin/commit/115157b45caa374719fa6ad2a3d46281c9109349 to monitor the sizes of invs-to-send. 80% of the observed queues have less than 10 elements, 99.3% have less than 100, 99.9% have less than 1000. The highest observed was 2698. The average is 10.05 elements, with standard deviation 16.65.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7805#issuecomment-206803916,206803916,

sipa,2016-04-04T13:37:52Z,"Have you verified that using this comparator does not change the order of blocks?\n\nAlternatively, if both entries are blocks, perhaps they should be sorted by height?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7805#discussion_r58376031,58376031,src/main.cpp
sipa,2016-04-04T13:38:46Z,This rate should be a named constant.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7805#discussion_r58376140,58376140,src/main.cpp
gmaxwell,2016-04-04T19:32:58Z,It probably does change it (the sort isn't stable).  I'll make it sort them by height... or I could split transactions off entirely.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7805#discussion_r58434042,58434042,src/main.cpp
