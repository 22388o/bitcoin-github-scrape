By far most nodes simply send the tx when requested, even if sometimes they take their time.\n\nI've also tried with a timeout of 30 seconds for a while, and retries were much more numerous. In general, the first node would still send the transaction anyway, as well as the other nodes who are asked. 10 seconds would be crazy. \n\nThe P2P network was never designed to be a low-latency network, and there is also not really a point in making it one. If anything, high-latency networks lend themselves better to privacy measures.\n\nWith the changes in #4831 all the pathological cases are avoided. A node announcing transactions then disconnecting, for example, will have no effect. The retry will always go to a node that is still connected and that has announced the transaction. This makes sure that second retries are even more infrequent.\n\nWe could add code to keep track of a running average of getdata response times, of course, and see from there.\n",

    "body": "Meta:  The following note was actually intended for another @rebroad PR, to which @gmaxwell replied, where there was another \"10 sec vs. 2 min\" debate.  I forgot the PR number.\n\n_Speaking generally_, this debate sometimes seems to illustrate linear thinking with regards to peer interactions.  In particular, I think two techniques are useful in byzantine networks:\n1. Get impatient.  When a local node requests something of a remote, and either (a) it does not receive a response after a short while, or (b) the remote responds at a punishingly slow trickle, the local node should notice this poor behavior and make the same query of another node.  As such, I'm a bit sympathetic to some of @rebroad 's goals.\n2. Go parallel & redundant.  Psychologically, engineers are resistant to this sort of solution, but a simple and effective approach may be to issue the same query in parallel, and discard useless or slow results.  Yes, this increases traffic on the network, but by a quantifiable factor of 2 or 3.\n\n10 seconds is too fast, 2 minutes is too slow.  But I prefer better solutions to picking better magic numbers :) \n",

    "body": "@jgarzik By waiting only 10 seconds, in my experience, you'll have received an inv from >50% of currently connected nodes. This is surely more than enough time to select the fastest peer to send the getdata request to; and certainly an improvement on the current implentation (i.e. added benefit with no disadvantages). \n\nI.e. the \"10 seconds\" refers to the \"short while\" you mention. It's not the same delay (delay, not size of delay) as the delay used before requesting the tx from another peer.\n",
