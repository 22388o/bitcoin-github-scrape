    "body": "Right, so there are two solutions I see here:\n\n1) Ignore nonspendable outputs from balance calculations for sending transactions and add an option to the getbalance method (or add another API call) to distinguish between total balance and spendable balance.\n\n2) Add support for multiple wallets and require a wallet to either be 100% spendable or 100% unspendable.\n\nIt will probably also be necessary to add another field to the returned JSON for certain calls that states whether the addresses are spendable or not.\n\nI would prefer to have a completely separate structure for verification/tracking/ultrapruning of transactions and have the wallet just deal with private key storage and transaction signing. But that would require too many changes to get it integrated quickly. I think either of these two solutions is a reasonable compromise for now, the second one perhaps being more powerful and simpler from a usage perspective.\n",

    "body": "As to not break compatibility with the existing RPC calls, I'm thinking we can have a main wallet which is always used as the default wallet. If the user wants to use a different wallet, the name of the wallet would have to be specified in the call. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like we can use many of the existing RPC calls (sendfrom, sendmany,sendtoaddress, etc...) since they all have optional parameters already and it would be awkward to just tack on the wallet name parameter at the end. Also, walletpassphrase is problematic as it is not stateless. So it looks like we need a whole separate set of calls which require a wallet name and passphrase (if the wallet is encrypted).\n\nFor instance,\n\n```\nwalletsendtoaddress <walletname> <passphrase> <bitcoinaddress> <amount> [comment] [comment-to]\n```\n\nThis is one of the unfortunate things about relying on parameter order rather than key-value pairs.\n",
