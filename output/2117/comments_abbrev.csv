CodeShark,2012-12-20T02:53:06Z,"Right, so there are two solutions I see here:\n\n1) Ignore nonspendable outputs from balance calculations for sending transactions and add an option to the getbalance method (or add another API call) to distinguish between total balance and spendable balance.\n\n2) Add support for multiple wallets and require a wallet to either be 100% spendable or 100% unspendable.\n\nIt will probably also be nec",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2117#issuecomment-11558519,11558519,
