Reduces the number of false positives when hunting file descriptor leaks.\n\nThanks for a nice first-time contribution!",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10837#issuecomment-315563465,315563465,

bytting,2017-07-15T20:11:12Z,"As I understand it, most OS's will close descriptors on exit, but it is not guaranteed by the C language, so best practice is to close properly.\n\nAlso, depending on the behavior of RandFailure, which could change in the future, seems sloppy",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10837#discussion_r127592105,127592105,src/random.cpp
