Turning it into change adds an output (34 bytes) and then later spending that change adds an input (144 bytes), so as long as the fee we would pay for those 178 bytes is less than the amount we would turn into change, it is worth it. You probably want a small constant factor (at least 3, like the dust rule itself uses) above that number, though.\n",
