promag,2018-05-30T19:58:28Z,IMO this could be in line 86 above where `vSolutionsRet` is also cleared/initialized. It also prevents the same problem if in the future early failure returns are added.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13351#discussion_r191903114,191903114,src/script/standard.cpp

MarcoFalke,2018-06-04T18:06:11Z,"> Could also drop lines 154 & 155 if you move this up.\n\nThat would just make it more fragile. As I understand this function signature, it is meant to return a ""pair"" of `typeRet` and `vSolutionsRet`. Setting that pair should happen as close to the return statement as possible (regardless of early-return or not).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13351#discussion_r192831200,192831200,src/script/standard.cpp

promag,2018-06-04T23:32:33Z,I just consider best practice to reset outputs in the begin if the function has multiple exits. LGTM still.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13351#discussion_r192909484,192909484,src/script/standard.cpp
