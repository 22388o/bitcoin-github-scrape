kallewoof,2021-08-23 07:23:06,"@MarcoFalke The transaction is supposedly not yet broadcasted. They'd only need to call getbalances once. The existing output would give the wallet's balance as it is (excluding the transaction), and the added ""changes"" would show how the balance would change, if the transaction was broadcasted.\n\nI.e.
