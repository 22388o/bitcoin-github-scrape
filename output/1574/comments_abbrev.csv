If not it still should be correct.\n\nAt least the current `||` is wrong either as it tries to run the code, when compiling on Windows ;).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1574#issuecomment-6873562,6873562,
laanwj,2012-07-10T12:08:27Z,"It means ""Not on windows OR USE_BUILD_INFO=1"". We use USE_BUILD_INFO in the gitian build.\n\nIf you replace it with ""Not on windows AND USE_BUILD_INFO=1"" you change the meaning completely. For non-windows platforms you don't have to set USE_BUILD_INFO=1 but it's default.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1574#issuecomment-6873659,6873659,
