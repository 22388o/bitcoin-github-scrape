gandrewstone,2017-08-06T14:27:03Z,so its not.  Pick this PR or make another... it took me 5 minutes to point this very small issue out but that's all the time I'm inclined to spend on it.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10990#issuecomment-320510261,320510261,
achow101,2017-08-06T17:14:07Z,"@gandrewstone Your PR does not do that. Your PR is not making the ""nLockTime value to inform the nSequence"". You don't even touch the nSequence., I agree that nLockTime should inform and partially dictate what the nSequence is going to be, but your PR doesn't do that. It just puts a lock time on transactions when they use `fundrawtransaction` and we don't want that to happen as it is doing somethi",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10990#issuecomment-320519667,320519667,

As @achow101 says, the `_rawtransaction` RPCs are tools for advanced users and `fundrawtransaction` shouldn't be changing the locktime value unexpectedly under the user's feet.\n\nI'm happy to review any future PR where nLockTime informs the nSequence value, but I'm also a NACK for this PR.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10990#issuecomment-322598291,322598291,
