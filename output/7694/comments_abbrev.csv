laanwj,2016-03-16T08:48:15Z,"Although this change in isolation makes sense, I don't think renaming these functions is a good idea right now - this is exactly the code that softforks and such change, complicating backporting work.\n(and in contrast to move-only pulls, renaming is non-trivial to backport over - harder to trace forward/back what function became what)\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7694#issuecomment-197215021,197215021,

jtimon,2016-03-16T18:16:11Z,"On the other hand, this will be ""free"", whenever we want to change the parameters of those functions.\nFor example, I have proposed to rename CheckBlockHeader and friends to Consensus::CheckBlockHeader several times in the past. but it is free to do such a rename while decoupling the functions from chainparams.o and timedata.o (which are not wanted in libconsensus), see https://github.com/jtimon/b",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7694#issuecomment-197465757,197465757,

laanwj,2016-03-17T11:38:12Z,"After a refactor/move it's straightforward to grep where a function went, if there are no renames. If you also rename the function, it's much harder to find out what became of it.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7694#issuecomment-197839304,197839304,
jtimon,2016-03-17T11:59:03Z,"What do you mean ""where a function went""? It should be called from exactly the same places and its declaration and definition shouldn't move if you are only changing the arguments of a function and its name. Do you think there's anything wrong with renaming the functions in https://github.com/jtimon/bitcoin/commit/46a520ab676fe97a597a55df2f79d694352f8599 ?

jtimon,2016-03-17T12:33:13Z,"I'm just asking sincerely. I never thought about the rename in my example being a concern (since anything conflicting with it is going to conflict in the exact same lines either way), but since it seems there is, I will remove anything related to the consensus namespace in my branch.
