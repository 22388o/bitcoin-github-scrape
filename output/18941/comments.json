    "body": "I'm not sure this is useful.\r\n\r\nMy information is several years old, so take this with a grain of salt. Actual benchmarks would of course be better.\r\n\r\nI experimented with several different designs for partial flushing, where some data remained in the cache at the time it was flushed, and surprisingly, they were invariably all slower than just wiping everything every time. The reason is that our cache isn't really a cache but a buffer: its performance gains come from the fact that it (dramatically) reduces disk writes (it also reduces disk reads, but the impact of those is far less). The reason is that most UTXOs get created and spent within a short time frame, and if they happen within a cache window, without flush in between, the created UTXO is deleted from memory, without ever hitting disk. At least on the systems I tested on, reserving a portion of the cache as \"flushed but still cached\" was never better than just using that area as additional write-saving buffer.",

If instead it was a non-clearing flush, there would be no such downside.\r\n\r\nEither having data already in the cache is desirable, or we always want a clear cache so we can write as much as possible.\r\n\r\nOr perhaps I haven't made the motivation clear. This does not do a partial flush. It just warms up the cache after a restart. Say you have 100 MB in the cache but you need to reboot. Upon startup you will have an empty cache, which you say above will temporarily kill your performance.\n\nI suppose I should benchmark connecting a block with an empty cache and one with a full cache to measure the read benefit.",

    "body": "I've put together some benchmarks. TL;DR running with the entire utxo set in memory can shave off several hundred milliseconds in ConnectBlock.\r\n\r\nI benchmarked with [this patch](https://github.com/andrewtoth/bitcoin/commit/405faf362ae8084b524b043db0c27255fab3e1a6) that records the ConnectBlock time and whenever a flush happens. I ran with `-dbcache=20000 -persistcoinscache=1 -reindex-chainstate -stopatheight=600000`. For a baseline I ran with an [earlier commmit](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/11f466b8d1e1fd5c61dfc231e1cdb76d73317606) which blocks the main thread until the cache is fully loaded, and ran with `-dbcache=20000 -persistcoinscache=1`. I then ran the same from block 600000 with [this patch](https://github.com/andrewtoth/bitcoin/commit/33228749736932aee84ad15f303ccd5aa8ef13de) to always flush the coins cache so it would always be empty. This gave me the connect block times for a cache with the entire utxo set, and an empty cache on each block connection. I also ran with default dbcache for comparison. Below is a plot of the time deltas between block connection in milliseconds. Orange is the delta between empty cache and full cache, and red is the delta between default cache and full cache with blue dots plotting the times the cache was flushed. I also capped the delta to 400 ms so it would be easier to read.\r\n\r\n![connectblockchart-av](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/237213/82836745-b409d080-9eb6-11ea-9933-2a8e7ac104ca.png)\r\n\r\nThere's some noise after the assumevalid block, so to account for that I reran all three with `-assumevalid=0`:\r\n\r\n![connectblockchart-noav](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/237213/82836788-cab02780-9eb6-11ea-9a56-8dddea4d2906.png)\r\n\r\nI also plotted the 20 block rolling average of deltas to reduce noise:\r\n\r\n![connectblockchart-rollingaverage](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/237213/82836823-dd2a6100-9eb6-11ea-92ff-f1bf71b16e94.png)\r\n\r\nThis shows performance degradation at points where the cache is cleared. The above tests were using an internal SSD. I reran the tests with an external HDD, but the results are much more noisy. Here's the 20 block rolling average results:\r\n\r\n![connectblockchart-hdd](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/237213/82836857-f6cba880-9eb6-11ea-9db5-8d10e19cefb6.png)\r\n\r\nIt seems running with an empty cache can have a performance penalty of several hundred milliseconds in many cases. #14387 and #14397 were attempting to improve the performance of ConnectBlock by [much less](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14387#discussion_r222908232) but were closed because they were too complex. I believe running in the configuration enabled by this PR could be useful to users who wish to connect blocks as fast as possible, as pointed out by [these](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14387#issuecomment-442748969) [comments](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15218#issuecomment-523587757). [This comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15265#issuecomment-457792904) also suggests that an empty cache is harmful to performance:\r\n\r\n> I suspect the periodic flushes are by far the biggest source of blockacceptance/gbt latency though, so it's one which would almost certainly have a big payoff.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
