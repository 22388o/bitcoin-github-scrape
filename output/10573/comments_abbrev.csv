That results in fragile code that breaks when indirect dependencies change.\n\nIn general, every .cpp and .h file should `#include` every header that it directly uses function/classes/definitions from, even if that's already implied by other dependencies. One exception is that a .cpp file does",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10573#issuecomment-307656029,307656029,
