That results in fragile code that breaks when indirect dependencies change.\r\n\r\nIn general, every .cpp and .h file should `#include` every header that it directly uses function/classes/definitions from, even if that's already implied by other dependencies. One exception is that a .cpp file does not need to re-include things that its corresponding .h already included.",
