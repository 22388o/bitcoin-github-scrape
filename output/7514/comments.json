    "body": "Thanks for the feedback. I agree, testnet-specific behavior should be avoided if at all possible, but the testnet-specific difficulty rules seem to be what is causing the problem. Maybe another solution would be to have the code that resets testnet difficulty after 20 minutes also reset the work value for pindexBestHeader so a new block with less work is able to replace it. I'm not sure where that happens, though, so I haven't been able to test it out.\n\nIt's also possible my theory isn't exactly correct. Currently, my pindexBestHash is set to a block with a height 2000 below the current tip, but the nChainWork is greater than the current tip. It doesn't show on any block explorers, so maybe it was set to a very high difficulty then orphaned.\n\nIn theory the same thing could happen on mainnet, but with the amount of mining power out there I can't imagine someone mining an orphaned block that still has more POW than the main chain 2000 blocks later.\n\nThoughts?\n",

    "body": "I'm no longer able to reproduce the problem, as my node's chain tip and best header are now in sync. I agree there is probably a deeper problem here, but I think the proposed changes are acceptable because they help testnet nodes act more like mainnet in some fringe cases without affecting anything other than isInitialBlockDownload (which should only matter when nodes are first getting started).\n\nI have been running my node with the proposed changes and haven't noticed any adverse effects. Can I ACK my own proposal? :)\n",
