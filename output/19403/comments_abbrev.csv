sipa,2020-06-29 03:59:08,These were 1; should they be replaced with the corresponding true define? I'm a bit surprised MSVC has the exact same builtins though.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19403#discussion_r446759078,446759078,build_msvc/bitcoin_config.h
fanquake,2020-06-29 04:02:43,"They were 1, but commented out. I think they were only in here because `build_msvc/bitcoin_config.h` began as a copy-paste job from `src/config/bitcoin-config.h`. MSVC doesn't have any of these builtins.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19403#discussion_r446759800,446759800,build_msvc/bitcoin_config.h
