laanwj,2018-08-02T10:23:22Z,"I'm not sure this is a good idea.\nI kind of liked having separate, specialized functions for this.\nThese currently happen to be implemented in terms of `strprintf`, but this is not necessary and has relatively high overhead.\n(originally these were implemented using the appropriate C functions, but this was changed due to locale-dependence concerns)\n\nSo tend toward NACK.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13840#issuecomment-409880305,409880305,
Empact,2018-08-02T15:24:24Z,I checked for cases in need of optimization and don't really see them. Here are some numbers which show about an order of magnitude of variance: http://www.zverovich.net/2013/09/07/integer-to-string-conversion-in-cplusplus.html fmt seems to have the fastest implementation according to these: http://www.zverovich.net/2013/09/07/integer-to-string-conversion-in-cplusplus.html https://github.com/fmtli,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13840#issuecomment-409966041,409966041,
donaloconnor,2018-08-03T21:54:27Z,"I'm tending towards a Nack for this too unfort.\n\n> Looking into that led me to inlining WriteOrderPos and correcting the format string to be unsigned for ccode and nTransactionsUpdatedLast.\n\nWhen yous say inlining, you mean in the code but the function is inlined anyway so run time it won't have a performance impact. I like the functions since they document the code. It's easier to read :-",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13840#issuecomment-410386077,410386077,
