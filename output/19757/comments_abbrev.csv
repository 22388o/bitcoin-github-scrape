theStack,2020-09-06 19:47:08,"Interesting idea! I tend to agree with @practicalswift though that probably the memory saving benefit doesn't outweigh the reduced code readability, at least not in the current form when the user part of the data structure suddenly has to take care of maintaining additional internal state that should not be exposed.\n\nWould it be possible to generalize the concept by creating a new container th",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19757#issuecomment-687882899,687882899,
JeremyRubin,2020-09-06 19:57:25,"Yeah it would be possible to encapsulate the API to a generic container.\n\nIt may be worth doing this IMO because we can replace malloc with a bounded free-list or a circular buffer or something else that can perform a lot better without worrying about the underlying structures.\n\nBut for STL magic, yes splicing a list is a bit special so something else would have trouble replicating that.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19757#issuecomment-687885137,687885137,
