sipa,2018-05-16T00:05:26Z,"Concept ACK, this is clearly an improvement.\n\nHowever, I feel that this issue is also an indication against using explicit types in this situation. Usually the intent with explicit types (in places where `auto` would be sufficient) is making sure relevant code fails to compile when a type is changed. This however is an example where an incorrect type results in degraded but otherwise undetecta",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13241#issuecomment-389352744,389352744,
Empact,2018-05-16T00:21:50Z,"@sipa Fair enough, an alternative would be to switch to `auto` or `::value_type` for the associated collections.\n\nMain argument for explicit types in this case is that they are locally self-documenting. I find `first` and `second` pretty weak on that front. So I'd prefer `value_type` over `auto`.\n\nMore arguments re `auto` in #12120.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13241#issuecomment-389355646,389355646,

promag,2018-05-16T12:20:09Z,"This may improve current code but the problem can come again in future code. I'm +1 in following a simple convention that prevents this problem. Personally for range based loops I prefer `auto&` or `const auto&` for any kind of container.\n\nutACK a631e95.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13241#issuecomment-389498448,389498448,
