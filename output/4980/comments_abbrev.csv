Diapolo,2014-09-25T11:24:45Z,"@laanwj Just to understand general rule here, it's perfectly equal wheter we use %i/%d/%u because of tinyformat and as such I shall revert the LogPrintx and strprintf changes, right?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4980#issuecomment-56805312,56805312,
laanwj,2014-09-25T11:29:29Z,"Right. They are equivalent, and changing them around gives pointless pull request and review work.
