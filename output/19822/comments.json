This code was introduced back in 2013 (see 4c6d41b8b653ef90639b1a32f6aab0bb1cef90c5).\r\n\r\nFuzzing with the sanitizers would have trivially caught this one but it seems like we're missing fuzzing coverage for `CChain::operator==`: https://marcofalke.github.io/btc_cov/fuzz.coverage/src/chain.h.gcov.html\r\n\r\nWill continue working on increasing fuzzing coverage as soon as the fuzzers that are currently under review have been processed (merged or rejected). If the review speed picks up a bit in `src/test/fuzz/` I think we'll soon achieve fuzzing coverage on par with -- or exceeding -- the unit test coverage :) Review welcome! \u2764\ufe0f \r\n\r\nACK 2c0e6403b6cca1c1ed42a03c14912ad4a03f277f -- diff looks correct, but I prefer deleting broken unused functions instead of fixing them: deleting them removes the need to reason about the correctness of the fix  entirely :)",
