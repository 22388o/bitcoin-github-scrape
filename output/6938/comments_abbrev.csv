paveljanik,2015-11-04T14:55:11Z,"@laanwj IMO `configure` without arguments should build whatever it can build (based on dependencies, and warn user that it can't build GUI because of missing deps) and you should be able to disable GUI with `--disable-gui` if you want to save compile time, do not care about GUI etc. Selecting which UI has sense only when you can and should select one of supported systems, but as we deprecate Qt4..",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6938#issuecomment-153752298,153752298,
jonasschnelli,2015-11-04T15:00:50Z,"I think `./configure` should only build the UI if the user did pass the `--with-gui` argument.
