practicalswift,2020-03-05 21:23:43,@jonatack The reason for the temporary commit was to allow for easy removal in the case that tests cases was added to the qa-assets repo before the merge of this PR :)  But to make things less confusing I've now squashed the two commits into one.

MarcoFalke,2020-03-09 16:27:01,"on a second thought, this is a bit too strict and causes many merge conflicts. I think we can remove `FUZZERS_MISSING_CORPORA` and create the dir unconditionally. With a comment it should be fine. I believe this was your initial suggestion on how to handle the two repos going out of sync.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18047#discussion_r389806280,389806280,test/fuzz/test_runner.py
