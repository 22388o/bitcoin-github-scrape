    "body": "Fetching from a std::map is really fast (order log N the number of entries in the map, which is very small as it only contains the command line arguments). Also it is only done once for every HTTP request, so I doubt that this gives a speed advantage.\n\nOn the other hand, I do think the code is somewhat cleaner storing the user and password in explicit variables. After all, it shouldn't matter conceptually where the settings come from. One could discard the command line arguments map after parsing them and storing the values in the appropriate component that needs them (most programs do that afaik).\n\nEventually these should be part of an object / namespace instead of globals though... :-)\n\nAnyway: ACK\n",
