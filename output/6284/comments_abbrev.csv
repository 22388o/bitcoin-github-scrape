laanwj,2015-06-17T07:07:00Z,"@fanquake Proxy is not a boolean option, although `-noproxy` will be valid after #6272.\n\nI agree that these `-noX=Y` semantics are a tad strange as well (which assigns `!Y` to X), but decided to keep them to make this not too big of a change.\nFor me personally, though, `-noX` only makes sense without argument. I've never felt the desire to use, say `-noX=0` to say `-X=1`.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6284#issuecomment-112683149,112683149,
