laanwj,2020-07-09 14:22:08,"I'm not sure on this. On one hand this is useful, on the other hand we did remove the similar message for `getinfo` a long time ago in b2f23c41538eaadd71c373ada75dd3a982eeb8bf.  `generate`, though shorter ago,  was removed more than a year ago (in 8bb3e4c487500a580e3e18791b1f4e7dcdd35442), so it seems to be a bit late to add this.\nBut no strong opposition.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19455#issuecomment-656157799,656157799,
