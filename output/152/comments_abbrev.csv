gavinandresen,2011-04-13T14:43:48Z,Nice!  RE: block download speed:  I'd suggest a check for if IsInitialBlockDownload() and don't bother writing best-block-index during the initial block download.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/152#issuecomment-995763,995763,

gavinandresen,2011-04-15T16:07:52Z,"Looking at this again and thinking about pulling, it seems more complicated than it needs to be-- CBlockLocator can already serialize/deserialize itself, is there a reason for the ReadBestBlock/WriteBestBlock methods?  Why not just Read/Write the CBlockLocator instead of CBLockLocator.vHave?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/152#issuecomment-1008586,1008586,
