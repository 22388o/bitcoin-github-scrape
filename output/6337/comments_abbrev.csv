paveljanik,2015-06-25T05:43:23Z,"RPC call `setmocktime` checks for regtest network, but `SetMockTime` does not contain such check. When the user adds this argument on !regtest network, mocktime is thus set. Do you want it this way as this is a change to the current status quo where user is not allowed to set mocktime on !regtest networks?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6337#issuecomment-115113386,115113386,
