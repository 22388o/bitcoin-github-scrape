jgarzik,2011-12-17T04:07:49Z,"IMO, CLIENT_NAME should not vary if/if-not GUI.  It's the same network logic.  If a problem arises where other network peers must test for a problematic bug, they have twice as many CLIENT_NAMEs to check for one bug.  Might be a privacy issue too?  Gives attackers obvious server-or-client decision point.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/707#issuecomment-3187628,3187628,

rebroad,2016-08-27T02:08:58Z,"NACK  :) It's a great idea when there is only one development team for bitcoin, but in the future I expect to see multiple development teams as part of bitcoin's decentralization, and then there will need to be a more non-linear to nodes communicating their capabilities. Does BIP 9 not already provide the functionality this is hoping to achieve?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/707#issuecomment-242889550,242889550,

rebroad,2016-08-27T02:45:03Z,"@luke-jr Yes, I realise this is a very old one hence the smiley, but it seems that with various other bitcoin nodes out there, for example, Unlimited are using Protocol Version >80000, which means that Core will assume it provides services such as compact blocks, SegWit, etc when it does not. I am thinking that the PROTOCOL_VERSION ought not to be relied upon as developers are moving away from it ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/707#issuecomment-242891083,242891083,
luke-jr,2016-08-27T02:59:24Z,"1. This isn't used for CB nor XThin.\n2. SegWit is a consensus layer upgrade, and is therefore not optional for full nodes.\n3. There is already (since 2011) a Bitcoin-wide standards process (Bitcoin Improvement Proposals; BIP) for changes to common infrastructure to be coordinated between different development teams.\n4. That said, this incrementing p2p protocol version number is probably growing",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/707#issuecomment-242891629,242891629,
