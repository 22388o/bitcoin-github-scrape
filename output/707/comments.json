    "body": "@luke-jr Yes, I realise this is a very old one hence the smiley, but it seems that with various other bitcoin nodes out there, for example, Unlimited are using Protocol Version >80000, which means that Core will assume it provides services such as compact blocks, SegWit, etc when it does not. I am thinking that the PROTOCOL_VERSION ought not to be relied upon as developers are moving away from it for reasons that need to be better understood. I suspect those reasons are that it doesn't suit multiple development teams as it enforces a level of linearity (i.e. all developers are expected to provide functionality before they can bump their version number) but not on a \"level playing field\". I.e. some developers might not want to add SegWit, but might want to add XThin - what should the protocol version be in that scenario?\n",
