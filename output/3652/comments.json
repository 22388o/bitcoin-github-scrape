    "body": "Right, there are other tools that can be used to index the entire block chain if you need to, for example for forensic reasons. One of these is Bitpay's insight. Anything that relies on indexing the whole block chain doesn't belong in Bitcoin Core. These indices could be anything, depending on the kind of queries you want to do. So use the right tool for the job.\n\nFrom mailing list discussion a similar index for the UTXO set would be acceptable. It would be a much smaller index and only relies on data that is needed anyway.\n",
