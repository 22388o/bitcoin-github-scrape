morcos,2016-10-21T12:56:33Z,"As discussed on IRC, I'm opposed to adjusting the default confirmation target to 2.  I think with the way current fee estimation works, the default case should not be ""I really want to be sure I'm included in one of the next 2 blocks"" because it will lead to you paying too high a fee for what most people are trying to accomplish.

I think it would be good to change both to that.\n\nThough I think changing that default is separate from what is done here - this just unifies the UI default to the overall default.\n\nEither way it needs to be clearly documented in the release notes that these defaults are changed.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8989#issuecomment-255371872,255371872,
MarcoFalke,2016-10-21T17:32:33Z,Completely agree with what @laanwj said in the last comment.
