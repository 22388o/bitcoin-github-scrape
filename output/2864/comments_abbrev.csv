jgarzik,2013-07-29T14:24:12Z,"This adds a poor layer of security on top of an RPC layer that we already recommend to _not_ be exposed to the public Internet.  Even seemingly harmless RPC commands might stress the wallet and delay other RPCs commands, hold important locks, etc.\n\nIf you want to do this, the best suggestion is to create a proxy on top of bitcoind, much like a pool server (which is nothing but an HTTP proxy).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2864#issuecomment-21723176,21723176,
dan-da,2013-07-29T18:01:52Z,"@jgarzik Thanks for the suggestion.    If core devs don't want the patch, no problem.  I am curious where this recommendation is to not expose RPC layer.   I don't see it on the wiki jsonrpc pages, <a href=""https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Original_Bitcoin_client/API_calls_list"">here</a> or <a href=""https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/API_reference_%28JSON-RPC%29"">here</a>.   Can you provide me a pointer?  thank",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2864#issuecomment-21738715,21738715,
