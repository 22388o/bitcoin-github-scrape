randolf,2018-02-19T20:14:15Z,"@esotericnonsense Binding to 0.0.0.0 means ""bind to all local addresses"" (which includes loopback, as I suspect you probably already know), and is often a default for many server daemons, so I don't see why it should be necessary to bind to loopback  specifically (unless, of course, -bind=127.0.0.1 was specified).\n\nOn a side-note:  When binding to 0.0.0.0, on some systems that support IPv6 thi",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12482#issuecomment-366792854,366792854,
