Diapolo,2012-05-01T17:12:52Z,"Seems like a good idea to move MyGetSpecialFolderPath function from util.cpp into guiutil.cpp, too, as I currently get: guiutil.cpp:229: Fehler:'MyGetSpecialFolderPath' was not declared in this scope.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1178#issuecomment-5443069,5443069,

laanwj,2012-05-01T17:20:58Z,"Thanks for the fixes.\n\nMyGetSpecialFolderPath cannot be moved as it's also used in GetDefaultDataDir, which should certainly stay in the core code.\n\nOn the other hand, if we can remove the fallbacks, we could simply use the windows API function SHGetSpecialFolderPathA directly in both places and get rid of MyGetSpecialFolderPath. For now, I'll simply add it to util.h.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1178#issuecomment-5443224,5443224,
