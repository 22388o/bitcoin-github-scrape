michaelfolkson,2019-08-14 11:55:57,I know this PR has been merged now but I would have liked more comments here as @jonatack suggested. I didn't understand what was going on. I understand there is a trade-off between informing less experienced users and minimizing noise for more experienced users. Perhaps when the minimizing noise option is chosen a Bitcoin StackExchange page can be set up to include those comments.
