Previously, -1\n+was returned when there was insufficient data to give an estimate.  Now, -1\n+will also be returned when there is no fee or priority high enough for the\n+desired confirmation target. In those cases, it can help to ask for an estimate\n+for a higher target number of blocks. It is not uncommon for there to be no\n+fee or priority high enough to be reliably (85%) included in the next block and\n+for this reason, the default for `-txconfirmtarget=n` has changed from 1 to 2.\n+\n Privacy: Disable wallet transaction broadcast\n ----------------------------------------------\n "
