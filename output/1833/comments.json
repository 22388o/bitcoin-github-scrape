I've changed the misbehaving threshold to 102 to avoid situations like this, which is why I didn't disconnect those two peers.... but, seems like nobody else has, as I was left with about 50 peers (though it gradually started increasing, up to 150'ish, but I decided to restart bitcoind anyway).  After that it only took about 10 minutes to get back up to ~800 (after restarting bitcoind), although about 80% of my addnodes were instantly disconnecting me.\n\nhttp://5.9.24.81/lollercopter.txt\n\nAs the only reason I initially started running bitcoind on the server was for p2pool and I no longer use p2pool, I guess now is as good a time as any to shut it down.  I'd rather use that server for video encoding & torrenting anyway (gbit connection and all).  Maybe mess around on my kimsufi pos.\n\nBut, yeah...  (oh, and I just included that first second... there were about 50 disconnects a second for another 10 seconds or so)\n",
