darkhosis,2012-09-19T11:07:10Z,"I had approx. 3200 transactions in pool when I updated my bitcoind to the new git version.  I decided to include this in the build...  got back up to ~3100 transactions in pool immediately.  The only ones I lost were the ones with the large orphans (I'll probably modify that and make it 20k or 30k).

mikehearn,2012-09-24T12:07:33Z,Cool. Restricting to outbound connections also means you won't send this command to SPV clients that don't track the entire mempool. It may be worth a comment that makes this explicit rather than a side-effect of checking for outbound-ness.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1833#issuecomment-8816591,8816591,
gmaxwell,2012-09-24T12:13:33Z,Hm. How do we prevent this from violating the (probably soon to be implemented) expectation that transactions will live in the mempools of the network for a particular amount of time?
