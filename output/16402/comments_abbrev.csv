Though, chain-specific wallet default values, should, if needed, reside in `./src/wallet/chainparams`. Otherwise they will make it harder to move the wallet to a separate repository, since both repos would have to be kept p",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16402#issuecomment-515706576,515706576,

If it was WalletIsTestnet separated from the other one, perhaps it would be better.\nLet's say we want regtest to be more like mainnet with respect to the fallback fee, like it happened with the default for acceptnonstdtxs in https://gith",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16402#issuecomment-517411593,517411593,
