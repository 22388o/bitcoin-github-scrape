Though, chain-specific wallet default values, should, if needed, reside in `./src/wallet/chainparams`. Otherwise they will make it harder to move the wallet to a separate repository, since both repos would have to be kept perfectly in sync with regard to the settings.",

If it was WalletIsTestnet separated from the other one, perhaps it would be better.\r\nLet's say we want regtest to be more like mainnet with respect to the fallback fee, like it happened with the default for acceptnonstdtxs in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15891.\r\nThen we would need to reintroduce m_fallback_fee_enabled or, even worse, introduce an IsRegtest method that ends up being used for all kinds of things.\r\nFor decoupling the wallet part of the chainparams, gaving a src/wallet/chainparams sounds like the long term solution. Or perhaps we can simply have the same defaults for mainnet and the test chains for wallet arguments, since testers can set them to whatever they want manually anyway. Perhaps the extra complexity is not worth it in this case.\r\nEither way, I don't see how this helps towards that goal of separating the wallet.",

I don't understand why have different defaults for different chains when they're just defaults that can be manually set by the user, or in a config file where I think they truly belong.
