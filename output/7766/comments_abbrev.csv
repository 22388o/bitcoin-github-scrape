laanwj,2016-03-30T07:10:57Z,"> Would it make sense to get rid of the duplicate code in void Register*()?\n\nMaybe. I thought about it, but it's only a simple loop of four lines, sometimes factoring something so simple out to a function makes things harder to understand, not easier. \nAnother option would be to export a 'descriptor structure' with a name, pointer to the array, and size of the array. E.g. like Linux modules.\nB",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7766#issuecomment-203283467,203283467,
jonasschnelli,2016-03-30T09:30:14Z,IMO we should keep the array loop as it is (and not refactor with some hard-to-understand macro-like optimization).\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7766#issuecomment-203344681,203344681,
