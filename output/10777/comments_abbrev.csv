paveljanik,2017-07-14T20:46:23Z,"utACK 49eb091\n\nBut I still wonder who and where defines `PRINT_SIGHASH_JSON `.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10777#issuecomment-315463458,315463458,
paveljanik,2017-07-09T10:55:38Z,`nRandomTests` is undeclared in case of `!defined(PRINT_SIGHASH_JSON)`. There are too many `#if defined(PRINT_SIGHASH_JSON)` anyway...,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10777#discussion_r126301605,126301605,src/test/sighash_tests.cpp
practicalswift,2017-07-09T11:07:22Z,@paveljanik Merged the two `#if defined(PRINT_SIGHASH_JSON)`:s. Looks better?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10777#discussion_r126301823,126301823,src/test/sighash_tests.cpp
paveljanik,2017-07-09T13:01:15Z,BTW - `PRINT_SIGHASH_JSON` is never defined in our tree.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10777#discussion_r126304048,126304048,src/test/sighash_tests.cpp
practicalswift,2017-07-09T17:51:19Z,@paveljanik The `ifdef` was added in 232aa9e034d4d48f4d16dfdc6bc0d56c9274cfd3 by @maraoz to control if `data/sighash.json` test data should be written. Is it no longer needed?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10777#discussion_r126310977,126310977,src/test/sighash_tests.cpp
