In my connect_block example I was only passing the height, but we\nprobably want to pass a few more things.\n\nSome goals for static traces should be:\n\n  - Somewhat stable API (order of arguments don't change) so people can\n    rely on these for scripting\n\n  - Some motivational use case\n\n@0xB10C's connected_block trace looks useful as well.\n\nCheers,\nWill\n",

I can see the benefit that they're very powerful and add almost no overhead when not used. On the other hand, there's almost an unlimited number of things that could be traced, adding `TRACE()` macros in lots of places could potentially make the source less readable, and it's possible to do a lot of useful tracing with uprobes that don't require any changes to the source.\r\n\r\nDo we know what other projects are doing?
