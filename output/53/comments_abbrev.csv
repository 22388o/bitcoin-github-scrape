gavinandresen,2011-01-31T23:55:11Z,"Why 21 hours:  it is exactly 1/16th the 2 weeks/2016 blocks of the main chain, and is more than 120 blocks (seemed like a good idea to allow blocks to mature and get spent before difficulty adjusts).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/53#issuecomment-726938,726938,
dooglus,2011-02-02T04:40:48Z,"I think I prefer exactly 1/14th the 2 weeks.  Make it 24h, then we're aiming to change difficulty at the same time each day, and can see whether the actual change times drift forward of backward on the clock.\n\nUnless there's a good reason not to?  24 hours is 144 blocks.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/53#issuecomment-731268,731268,
