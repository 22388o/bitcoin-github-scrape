gmaxwell,2012-04-02T18:47:18Z,"Half an hour was 7 false alarms per day, an hour is a false alarm every three days.  Two hours is once per three years.\n\nThe tradeoff is how quickly you let the user know that something is broken vs false alarms. Since it's already a pretty slow indicator even at 30 minutes, I think we should error towards fewer false alarms. 90 minutes is my recommendation too.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1026#issuecomment-4885429,4885429,
