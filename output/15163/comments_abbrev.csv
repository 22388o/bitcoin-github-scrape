laanwj,2019-01-24T15:49:09Z,Why is the `LL` suffix no longer needed here? Due to the new initialization style?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15163#discussion_r250661741,250661741,src/qt/guiconstants.h
sipa,2019-01-24T16:23:46Z,"@laanwj I was wondering about the same thing, and this is what I conclude.\n\nSince C++11, L, LL, UL, ULL should never be needed anymore, as the type of the constant is automatically chosen to be sufficiently large for the provided value, but signed. Before C++11, long long would not be automatically chosen.\n\nIt may be necessary to use a U suffix to indicate an unsigned constant, as a 64-bit val",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15163#discussion_r250677960,250677960,src/qt/guiconstants.h
