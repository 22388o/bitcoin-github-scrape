    "body": "> why should ConnectBlock even be aware that there is a fancy cache making GetScriptFlags faster?\r\n\r\nWell, GetScriptFlags is aware of it anyway, so at a minimum, I think not calling IsWitnessEnabled from it is very reasonable.\r\n\r\nRegarding the question, ConnectBlock should is aware of the global versionbitscache because it uses it though GetScriptFlags, whether we chose to make that dependency explicit or not.\r\nBut I guess this comes down to me liking globals being used explicitly instead of hidden when possible (and lower level functions that don't need to use the globals and can use local parameters instead do that instead of using globals they don't need to depend on).\r\nBut from past discussions I think you don't believe there's anything wrong with using globals when you don't need them or anything good with functions declaring all their dependencies explicitly as parameters, so I guess I can't convince you on that.\r\n",
