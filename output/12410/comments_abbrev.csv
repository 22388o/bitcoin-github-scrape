laanwj,2018-02-12T09:22:31Z,"I still prefer `prefix:` to `[prefix]`. This is what linux, SDL, and many other projects use, I haven't ever seen the `[xxx]` convention for commits and I'm not sure why we need our own unique one.\nSo NACK on changing this.\n\n> Actually on PR titles I prefer github labels instead of prefixes, because a PR can affect multitple areas.\n\nContributors can't set these themselves.

randolf,2018-02-13T19:52:10Z,"@promag As long as it's easy to use and communicates clearly, I think it's better to have only one convention for this (whatever the consensus turns out to be).",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12410#issuecomment-365383668,365383668,
