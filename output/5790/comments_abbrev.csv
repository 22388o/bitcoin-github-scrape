jonasschnelli,2015-02-12T22:34:39Z,Looks good.\nI just started a gitian build. Will be done within ~10mins. https://builds.jonasschnelli.ch/pulls/5790/\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5790#issuecomment-74168218,74168218,
laanwj,2015-02-13T07:17:47Z,"As this is just a change to the gitian descriptors (and just the packaging in that), I suppose it doesn't necessitate another rc. In that case ACK for 0.10.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5790#issuecomment-74214466,74214466,
laanwj,2015-02-13T07:20:33Z,Mustn't gitian-osx-signer.yml (or detached-sig-apply.sh) also be changed for this change in structure?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5790#discussion_r24647852,24647852,contrib/gitian-descriptors/gitian-osx.yml
theuni,2015-02-13T07:44:05Z,"No, see the PR comment. sig creation is all relative to the working dir, and I've been meaning to make it extract to a subdir rather than polluting the current dir anyway. sig application is impartial, as it's also relative to the working dir.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5790#discussion_r24648636,24648636,contrib/gitian-descriptors/gitian-osx.yml
theuni,2015-02-13T07:46:00Z,"Actually, hold on that for a sec. On second thought you might be right.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5790#discussion_r24648676,24648676,contrib/gitian-descriptors/gitian-osx.yml
theuni,2015-02-13T07:57:04Z,"@laanwj My apologies, this does end up breaking the signing process. I'll revert that change since it's only needed for signing. We can do the cleanups post-0.10.\n\nThanks for catching it.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5790#discussion_r24649030,24649030,contrib/gitian-descriptors/gitian-osx.yml
