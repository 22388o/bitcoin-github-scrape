Is the runtime of the loops that enclose AlreadyHave dependent on I/O such as network/database?\n\nIt looks like AlreadyHave runs very fast (just some hash lookups), however the enclosing loops contains network calls such as PushMessage. I suppose it is undesirable to hold the lock during those?\n\nIn that case the current solution is best. It is also the best encapsulation.\n",
