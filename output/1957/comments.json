You can use the existing signmessage/verifymessage RPCs with the hash of the file (and maybe some added salt) as message. You could even generalize it to multiple files by signing a \"manifest\" (similar to how JAR files are signed). As an added bonus, you can choose any hash function you want to hash the files. This can all be implemented as client-only feature.\n\nWe have the mantra that everything that can be done outside the core, should be done outside the core. The discussion isn't about whether this feature deserves including or not!\n\n_an external tool will lead to lack of adoption_ that depends on how you market it.

    "body": "\"Also you don't need new RPC server calls for this.\"\nWe actually do, I personally won't trust a hash of a hash. Overloading the signmessage/verifymessage to have an option would be fine, but the feature has to implement the signature hash as a direct hash of the file.\n\nThe signmessage/verifymessage can be done outside of the core as well. This feature needs to be included into the core because there needs to be a uniform RPC call defined that other bitcoin clients will adopt.\n\nI don't really know why an additional RPC call is met by a fear of the code maintanance overhead. This is pretty much just a wrapper function for signmessage. It's soo easy to maintain that I can't imagine the justification for NOT including it o.o If it was a security risk, or posed more maintainance, bloat, or other such problems I would understand, but on pius principle just isn't a valid reason to soo swiftly discount the inclusion.\n\nThis isn't controversial, why is it being made so?\n",

Discussion is good.\n\nI'd still really like to see a \"standardized\" way of signing files with my bitcoin key, but I agree the API doesn't really need to be any bigger than it is. How about keeping \"signfile\" and \"verifyfile\" as client-side calls that generate a hash of the file that's sent to the server for re-hashing and signing. I think _something_ like this belongs in this client, as it's basically the reference implementation of bitcoin, there's not much point signing files in a different way in each different client.\n",
