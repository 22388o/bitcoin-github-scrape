    "body": "I don't think adding the extra column to the table in dependencies is the right approach.\r\n\r\nTry adding a new section at the bottom instead \"Configuration options\". There you can explain the effect of each `--disable` option on which dependencies you need.\r\n\r\nRegarding Berkeley DB: it's used by the wallet, so you don't need it at all if you compile with `--disable-wallet`. In addition, which often confuses people, the wallet is super picky about which BDB version it wants, which is why we still use 4.8. If you don't mind a potentially incompatible wallet file, then you can use newer versions too. That's when you need `--with-incompatible-bdb`. Again, too subtle to squeeze into a column.\r\n\r\nP.S. I didn't know Github integrated so well with the `Co-authored-by` tag (no need by the way, though it's always nice).",

    "body": "Thanks for weighing in, @laanwj. I see your point. \r\nHowever, having a history as a technical writer (but also developer for many years), I tend to think mainly in terms of readability and simplicity for the majority of the readers. \r\n\r\nAs @Sjors writes above, the main target audience for these instructions is probably users, not developers. As a result, I think it makes a lot of sense to think along the lines of \"convention over configuration\" and hide complexities wherever possible. Taking away non-crucial info can greatly improve docs like these, sometimes.  \r\n\r\nHaving said this, I admit that this PR (that started as a small simplification) may be growing over my head. I may not see the full implications of centralizing dependency info for several platforms into one place. Nonetheless, @sjors' suggestion to extend `dependencies.md` sure seemed like an elegant and de-duplicating doc refactoring.\r\n\r\n  \r\n",
