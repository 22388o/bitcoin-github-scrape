jgarzik,2014-03-20T13:59:07Z,I agree that it _seems_ like it would be faster and smaller...  Need numbers etc.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3912#issuecomment-38169416,38169416,
laanwj,2014-03-20T14:23:41Z,"Agreed, generally a reasonable amount of arithmetic is faster than LUTs on modern hardware (memory access is such a bottleneck), and this is a single shift.\n\nThe code also looks better this way (IMO).\n\nStill, if the claim is that this makes it faster, it's nice to have numbers :-)\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3912#issuecomment-38172348,38172348,
laanwj,2014-04-11T13:16:19Z,"Meh, I'm sure this at least doesn't make it slower, it's a trivial change that is easy to understand, and makes the code shorter and easier to understand. Let's just merge it...\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3912#issuecomment-40201862,40201862,
