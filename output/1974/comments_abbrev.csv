freewil,2012-11-03T21:25:33Z,This is repetitive and doesn't add any new functionality. You can check for new incoming transactions after -blocknotify and obviously you will already know about outgoing transactions.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1974#issuecomment-10044423,10044423,
kjj2,2012-11-03T21:53:54Z,"No, this triggers when a transaction comes in or goes out in any way, not just when blocks hit.  And now that we have the raw transaction API and offline signing and transmission is relatively easy, it is no longer obvious when transactions go out.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1974#issuecomment-10044686,10044686,
sipa,2012-11-05T00:46:55Z,"This is probably useful for a lot of people who would otherwise depend on polling (or using centralized services to know when to poll), but it hopefully doesn't inspire people to do 0-conf accepts.\n\nACK.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1974#issuecomment-10057975,10057975,
jgarzik,2012-11-16T02:27:31Z,ACK... with maybe some doc describing some usage issues like what Gavin raised.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1974#issuecomment-10434507,10434507,
CodeShark,2012-12-24T07:09:19Z,I've had a need for this kind of alert in applications before and as a result ended up writing a custom bitcoin client with its own internal filtering. I would love to be able to attach a listener to the mempool (perhaps SyncWithWallets could be extended to this end) which can perform filtering beyond just CWallet::IsMine(). Perhaps we can also filter out transactions below a certain size threshol,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1974#issuecomment-11655453,11655453,
rebroad,2012-12-24T11:41:37Z,"How about instead an option to output transaction information to a file instead? That way, a separate program can deal with the problem of flooding, etc, and triggering commands from output as it appears in the file.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1974#issuecomment-11659181,11659181,
gavinandresen,2013-02-22T16:47:00Z,Couple of ACKS... this is definitely better than what we have now.  I'm going to pull.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1974#issuecomment-13954885,13954885,
gavinandresen,2012-11-05T19:28:24Z,"This opens up a potential DoS, I can send you a gazillion tiny transactions to try to get you to spawn gazillions of threads.\n\nI'd suggest not notifying transactions that are less than MIN_TX_FEE/-mintxfee (see code after // Fee-per-kilobyte amount considered the same as ""free"" in main.cpp)\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1974#discussion_r2033822,2033822,src/wallet.cpp
gmaxwell,2012-11-05T19:32:14Z,"Uh.  I'd worry that callers wouldn't be aware of that subtle detail and would have applications which missed small transactions.\n\nIf the API worked in a way that it could simply be rate limited to not notify more than X times per second then that would be a preferable option, but the 1:1 behavior doesn't seem to work for that.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1974#discussion_r2033882,2033882,src/wallet.cpp
kjj2,2012-11-05T20:01:46Z,"Since this triggers when a transaction updates the wallet, a potential DOS attacker would need to know both your IP (because no one will relay), and one of your addresses (pubkeys) to do their dust attack.  In my opinion, there are easier ways for them to DOS you at that point.\n\nAlso, the fee calculations are not trivial.  Adding that would require either duplicating a lot of code, or moving tho",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1974#discussion_r2034267,2034267,src/wallet.cpp
gavinandresen,2012-11-06T00:36:01Z,"I'd be curious to see what happens if you run this experiment on testnet:\n- Create 100 transactions, each with 1 well-aged input and (oh, I dunno) 100 output that all go to the same wallet (100 different addresses, though).\n- Now send them all at the same time.\n\nIf the inputs are old enough and large enough, you could perform the above attack paying minimal transaction fees.\n\nI predict Bad T",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1974#discussion_r2037444,2037444,src/wallet.cpp
