Sjors,2019-02-27T16:41:47Z,Why WIP? That seems more appropriate for more experimental code. This PR is already tagged 0.19 so that should be clear enough.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15492#issuecomment-467936679,467936679,
jnewbery,2019-02-27T16:50:54Z,Tagging 0.19 is fine. Just as long as the maintainers are aware that this shouldn't be merged prior to the branch split.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15492#issuecomment-467940182,467940182,
ryanofsky,2019-02-27T17:13:51Z,"This PR seems reasonable, but I would like to remove:\n\n> Removal helps with separating the wallet from the node in #15288 \n\nfrom the PR description. I don't think this is true in any significant sense.
