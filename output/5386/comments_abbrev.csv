I started to type in suggestions to find you'd already done them and used the same names in the patch.   dont use ""???"" in C/C++ code, it looks like a trigraph and will make some compilers whine.

sipa,2014-11-29T10:06:43Z,"I'm actually wrong. What is currently called valid-headers is actually a fork for which we do have the blocks, but wasn't ever activated (thus we don't know whether the scripts are valid).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5386#issuecomment-64947140,64947140,

gmaxwell,2014-11-30T23:45:01Z,I'm tagging this as 0.10 now because without it headers-first makes this RPC confusing. @laanwj if you disagree don't hesitate to untag.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5386#issuecomment-65006154,65006154,
