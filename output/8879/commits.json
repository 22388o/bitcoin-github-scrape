In addition to owning these five page views, a WalletView also has a pointer to a WalletModel instance.\n-This allows the construction of multiple WalletView objects, each rendering a distinct wallet.\n-\n-A second class called *WalletFrame* inheriting from QFrame has been written as a container for embedding all wallet-related\n-controls into BitcoinGUI. At present it contains the WalletView instances for the wallets and does little more than passing on messages\n-from BitcoinGUI to the currently selected WalletView. It is a WalletFrame instance\n-that takes the place of what used to be centralWidget in BitcoinGUI. The purpose of this class is to allow future\n-refinements of the wallet controls with minimal need for further modifications to BitcoinGUI, thus greatly simplifying\n-merges while reducing the risk of breaking top-level stuff.\n-\n-Changes to bitcoin.cpp\n-----------------------\n-bitcoin.cpp is the entry point into bitcoin-qt, and as such, will require some minor modifications to provide hooks for\n-multiple wallet support. Most importantly will be the way it instantiates WalletModels and passes them to the\n-singleton BitcoinGUI instance called window. Formerly, BitcoinGUI kept a pointer to a single instance of a WalletModel.\n-The initial change required is very simple: rather than calling `window.setWalletModel(&walletModel);` we perform the\n-following two steps:\n-\n-\twindow.addWallet(\"~Default\", &walletModel);\n-\twindow.setCurrentWallet(\"~Default\");\n-\n-The string parameter is just an arbitrary name given to the default wallet. It's been prepended with a tilde to avoid name collisions in the future with additional wallets.\n-\n-The shutdown call `window.setWalletModel(0)` has also been removed. In its place is now:\n-\n-window.removeAllWallets();"
