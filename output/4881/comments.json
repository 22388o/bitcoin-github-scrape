    "body": "The latest license discussion was in #4832. \nWhat I do by default is copying the license from another file (and I suspect most people do this same thing), so whatever license it is, we may want to merge something like #4832 once instead of having this discussion every time someone creates a new file just copying the license. I think I would do the same with little corrections like the missing comment at the end of the #endif of the .h file.\nThese mistakes are much harder to be repeated if people use existing files as templates and we already have what we want in existing files. Although a PR fixing all licenses and endif comments will likely touch many files, it will probably merge cleanly with any other changes in the same files.  \nAnd although a PR fixing all alphabetic orderings is more likely to produce conflicts you may want to do it once and police that nobody breaks it from then on as well. At least I wouldn't oppose to it.\nI know these things aren't high priority, I'm just expressing my preference to fix these things at once over fixing it little by little first in new files and then in many small PRs or included in other PRs that are touching those parts of the code anyway like with clang formatting.\n",
