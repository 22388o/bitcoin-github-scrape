sipa,2012-09-28T14:52:40Z,"@Diapolo I haven't checked lately, but if I recall correctly, IMPLEMENT_RANDOMIZE_STACK was effectively compiled away in recent GCCs. I've already argued for removing it, and still think we should - we have -fstack-protector to accomplish this now. I certainly won't implement it myself for new threads, though I wom't stop anyone from adding it.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1880#issuecomment-8978807,8978807,
Diapolo,2012-09-28T15:15:44Z,"@sipa I'm not an in depth security guru, so if we are safe and the macro doesn't add anything to our security hull I'm also fine with removing it entirely. Perhaps the person who introduced it can comment?\n\nEdit: When GCC optimises it away, that would be also a fact pro removal IMO.\n\nEdit 2: Other than that I like this patch :).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1880#issuecomment-8979637,8979637,

Diapolo,2012-09-28T16:59:38Z,@laanwj Some decissions I don't understand ... the code could be a little easier to read without it and would be shorter.
