MarcoFalke,2020-09-30 17:53:49,Seems odd for a constructor to log anyway. I'd say to remove them or move them elsewhere,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20048#issuecomment-701546614,701546614,
jonatack,2020-09-30 18:08:27,"Makes sense, but I didn't move them because they are related to the values being set, and because the first message interrelates with the other `-signetchallenge` messages and value settings.
