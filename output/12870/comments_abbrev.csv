theuni,2018-04-04T23:06:32Z,"This isn't quite right.\n- We avoid using wildcards whenever possible. A 'make clean' should never delete non-project files.\n- qt stuff should be in Makefile.qt.in\n- This should be handled via dependency rather than added as an extra.\n\nQT_MOC_CPP ends up in CLEAN_QT, which is added to CLEANFILES. Did this not already work as expected?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12870#issuecomment-378772601,378772601,
Sjors,2018-04-05T07:36:01Z,"`make clean` left at least one `src/qt/moc_*` file behind. That said, I can't reproduce it by simply going back to the previous commit on master (b386970d0) and running `autogen`, `configure`, `make` and then `make clean`.\n\nIt may have been left behind by some other branch* and thus not be covered by `QT_MOC_CPP`. What's the correct way of handling such a scenario without using wildcards?\n\",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12870#issuecomment-378846608,378846608,
