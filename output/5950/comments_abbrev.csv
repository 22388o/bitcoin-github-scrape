laanwj,2015-03-27T07:05:40Z,This appears to revert part of #5877.\n\nCan you add a concrete test case for this? This more and more looks like just some occult incantation to ward off the evil spirits of bad locales :)\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5950#issuecomment-86849397,86849397,

Although I'd prefer making the test consume less time, and adding it to the pull tester. What is so time consuming? The environment setup is one of the first things it does, after all, so at least in theory it could be a matter of quickly inv",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5950#issuecomment-88428286,88428286,

I sort of have a bad feeling, because I initially changed `setenv(""LC_ALL"", ""C"", 1)` to `std::locale::global(std::locale(""C""))`, which then turned out to be less reliable, and 0.10 currently still fails the [test](https://gist.github.com/dexX7/ab3f7411a9040e96d55c).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5950#issuecomment-94063829,94063829,
