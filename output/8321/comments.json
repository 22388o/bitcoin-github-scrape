If you want to help with qa and tests for example, you can ping me to get me compile a list of outstanding improvements.\n\nAlso, you can pick a random pull and compile it locally to do see if it does what it is supposed to do. Then report your findings in the pull. Usually you will find a ton of trivial stuff to improve by this. For example: #8336. (Just keep in mind to leave style-only-fixes to a minimum for now)\n",

I agree that sizeof(vch) is cleaner, but if a change would be made that changes vch's size, things would break in more subtle ways (because the serialization of keys would differ).\n\nOne possibility is doing the 32 -> sizeof(vch), but also adding an asset/static_assert that sizeof(vch) == 32, with a comment explaining that this can't just be changed. That way you get both properties.\n",
