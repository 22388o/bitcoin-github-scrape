maaku,2012-07-13T21:12:55Z,"By ""platform-independent"" I meant any platform where the bitcoin reference client currently runs. Vagrant is a tool for specifying the state of VirtualBox instances, so this is necessarily limited to platforms that VirtualBox run on (Mac OS X, Windows, Linux, and Solaris on x86_64). Ruby runs on all of those platforms too.\n\nWhat these scripts do is build a VirtualBox instance containing Ubuntu 1",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1597#issuecomment-6975457,6975457,
