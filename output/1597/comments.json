Vagrant is a tool for specifying the state of VirtualBox instances, so this is necessarily limited to platforms that VirtualBox run on (Mac OS X, Windows, Linux, and Solaris on x86_64). Ruby runs on all of those platforms too.\n\nWhat these scripts do is build a VirtualBox instance containing Ubuntu 12.04, then calls Gitian with USE_LXC=1. It also patches gitian and the gitian build scripts as needed to run within VirtualBox, downloads the various dependencies, etc.\n",

    "body": "Just to be clear, very little of this pull request has anything to do with gitian. @BlueMatt and I had a discussion about this on IRC, and I agree now that it would have been better if I had never mentioned gitian.\n\nThe purpose of these scripts is to enable a developer on Windows to create Windows binaries, or a Mac developer to generate Linux binaries (two actual use cases I encountered), as well as any other combination of build-host system. Gitian is being used simply because it is the most reliable process for doing cross-platform builds of bitcoind and Bitcoin-Qt.\n\nIncluded are are a handful of fixes required to get gitian running within an already-virtualized environment, and in time (aka, when I or someone else has time) those patches will be generalized and submitted upstream to gitian-builder. But that should be a minor footnote. This is really about doing cross-platform or local builds without complicated dedicated build servers.\n",
