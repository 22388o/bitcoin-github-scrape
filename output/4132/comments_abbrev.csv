laanwj,2014-05-05T19:13:44Z,This doesn't look correct. You shouldn't call MapPort at all if USE_UPNP is not set.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4132#discussion_r12294375,12294375,src/net.cpp
laanwj,2014-05-05T19:15:11Z,"There are three settings for USE_PNP:\n- `#undef USE_UPNP`: no libupnpc compiled in at all\n- `#define USE_UPNP 0`: libupnp compiled in, but defaults to off\n- `#define USE_UPNP 1`: libupnp compiled in, and defaults to on\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4132#discussion_r12294444,12294444,src/net.h

laanwj,2014-05-08T08:35:10Z,"No - USE_UPNP can be defined and be either 0 or 1, depending on whether it should be enabled by default or not.
