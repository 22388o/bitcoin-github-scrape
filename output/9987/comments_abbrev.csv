Seeing those (albeit unused) static consts helped me to understand the script code more quickly.\n\nAgree, let's just put those back. There is zero overhead to defining a few extra constants for clarity even if unused.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9987#issuecomment-287014661,287014661,

laanwj,2017-03-16T10:22:21Z,"We probably want to keep this one around for symmetry.\nSometimes blindly removing unused code can cause an API to become lopsided, and cause methods to go missing which clearly will have a use at some point, and it just indicates more tests are needed. This seems applicable here.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9987#discussion_r106381766,106381766,src/wallet/db.h
