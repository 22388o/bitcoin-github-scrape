Unless we have a rescan-down-to-height feature (which we don't have in 0.12), rescans don't work with pruning (current rescans always start at genesis).\nTend to NACK.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7581#issuecomment-188106302,188106302,
laanwj,2016-02-24T10:21:32Z,"I don't think this change is correct either. `-rescan` doesn't work with pruning, period. RPC calls such as import will work without rescan, though.\n\nI'm sure that could be worded better, though.\n\nBut there's a limit on how much time we should spend on polishing release notes on a release that's already ""history"".
