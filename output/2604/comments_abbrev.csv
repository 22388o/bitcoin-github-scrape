If we ever bring them back, we can resurrect the code from git history after writing extensive unit tests and looking for issues like this.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2604#issuecomment-17350447,17350447,
gmaxwell,2013-05-02T17:28:43Z,"@gavinandresen Agreed. It can't simply be brought back in any case, since they can't just be turned on without it being a hardfork relative to currently deployed nodes.

sipa,2013-05-02T19:00:04Z,"ACK on removing them. Indeed, all these opcodes are effectively identical to immediate failure anyway, and nothing except a hard fork can change that, and at that point, there is no reason why they should get a meaning identical to what is (was) implemented.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2604#issuecomment-17357563,17357563,
