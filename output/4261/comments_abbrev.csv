4tar,2014-05-30T16:11:25Z,@sipa Is there any reason (maybe historical?) for the return type to be double but not int64_t as which is the type of CNode::nLastRecv?  Do we need keep it still be double?  If so I'll go to re-submit a PR.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4261#issuecomment-44668833,44668833,
sipa,2014-05-30T16:13:44Z,The reason is (was) that at some point a more complex formula could be used.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4261#issuecomment-44669082,44669082,
4tar,2014-05-30T16:22:34Z,"@sipa Yep, that is what I guess.  But since this is a internal utility function but a general interface, anytime when we adjust the scoring algorithm we shall always change the function, so it may not necessary to keep the return value to be still in double, which creates extra, though negligible, type casting cost here...\n\nDo you think I should re-submit with keeping the original double type?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4261#issuecomment-44669989,44669989,
