    "body": "The datadir stuff is really overdue for a cleaner rewrite.\n\nThe caching makes little sense here in the first place. It should simply compute the directory (once!) and store it when the datadir (and the network, for the specific dir) is set, instead of computing it when it is requested and then caching. But this means having to properly define the initialization order :-)\n\nI've postponed this myself as this requires a comprehensive test plan first (what are people actually using?). And well, it works\\* and there are zillions of more serious issues.\n\n * There are some issues such as #3639 that could be solved here\n",
