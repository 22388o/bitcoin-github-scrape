laanwj,2014-09-01T08:00:38Z,"Looks good to me but you should very carefully test this. The datadir determination is extremely brittle code.\n\nMany times, changes such as this have broken something like 'Set the datadir in bitcoin.conf' or `Set the network in bitcoin.conf`. Also be sure to test with both the GUI and bitcoind as they have different initialization sequences.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4803#issuecomment-54031650,54031650,

It should simply compute the directory (once!) and store it when the datadir (and the network, for the specific dir) is set, instead of computing it when it is requested and then caching. But this means having to properly define the initialization order :-)\n\nI've postponed this m",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4803#issuecomment-54041367,54041367,
