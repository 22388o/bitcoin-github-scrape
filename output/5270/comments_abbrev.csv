domob1812,2014-11-13T10:49:59Z,"Hm, now that you mention it, AcceptBlock _does_ call CheckBlock.  So maybe the call to CheckBlockHeader should be moved inside of AcceptBlockHeader?  (Doesn't matter for the functionality, but is maybe cleaner and more consistent with the rest.)  So far I understood it as ""check first, then accept to only update the state"" (not quite, but more or less).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5270#issuecomment-62873375,62873375,
sipa,2014-11-13T10:57:06Z,"Indeed, that seems like the right place for it. Functionally it shouldn't matter, but it's strange that AcceptBlockHeader would accept an invalid header...\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5270#issuecomment-62874224,62874224,
domob1812,2014-11-13T19:07:03Z,"Updated accordingly.  Note that `AcceptBlock` now calls the PoW check twice:  Once via `CheckBlock` and once via `AcceptBlockHeader`.  I guess that doesn't hurt, though.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5270#issuecomment-62947509,62947509,
