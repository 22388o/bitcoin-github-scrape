hebasto,2018-10-08T16:57:47Z,"@promag \nThank you for your review.\n\n> I feel this doesn't belong to `-help`?\n\nWhich other piece of user documentation will be more suitable?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14427#issuecomment-427907170,427907170,
promag,2018-10-08T17:20:50Z,@hebasto in my opinion `-help` should be short and easy to lookup. Having this every time sounds unnecessary.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14427#issuecomment-427914219,427914219,
laanwj,2018-10-18T15:05:14Z,"I too think this is overkill; like with other programs `-help` is for a quick overview of options, it doesn't need to document the config file syntax.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14427#issuecomment-431045079,431045079,

promag,2018-10-08T14:13:18Z,Could drop `strBitcoinClient` and make this `By default a file named '%s' in the %s data director...`?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14427#discussion_r223378590,223378590,src/init.cpp
hebasto,2018-10-08T16:47:06Z,This is done on purpose to not translate a command line option.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14427#discussion_r223430773,223430773,src/init.cpp
hebasto,2018-10-08T16:53:28Z,"This wording is quoted from [BITCOIN.CONF(5)](https://manpages.debian.org/unstable/bitcoind/bitcoin.conf.5.en.html).\nWhy do you think the dropping `strBitcoinClient` out is preferable?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14427#discussion_r223432509,223432509,src/init.cpp
promag,2018-10-08T17:11:35Z,IMO it's independent of the binary so could drop it. Beside that manpage is from bitcoind package.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14427#discussion_r223437318,223437318,src/init.cpp
