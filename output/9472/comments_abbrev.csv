sipa,2017-01-04T18:54:31Z,Just realized that this code is wrong: it assumes the SIGCHECK_VERIFICATION_FACTOR applies after the timestamp and not before (as opposed to after the last checkpoint).,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9472#issuecomment-270454192,270454192,
sipa,2017-01-04T18:56:58Z,Suggestion: get rid of the SIGCHECK_VERIFICATION_FACTOR entirely (as it now applies to over 80% of the chain's transactions).,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9472#issuecomment-270454814,270454814,
