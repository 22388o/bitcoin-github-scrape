fanquake,2020-07-03 02:16:19,"I've added #19215 and #19300 cc @achow101 & @promag if you want to check those. I've also added a commit to remove the FreeBSD job from the Cirrus config, as that seemed to be continually failing in the ""installing packages"" phase (it has also been removed from master).",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19224#issuecomment-653298184,653298184,
fanquake,2020-07-08 06:59:42,"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19219 has been added. The second commit (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19224/commits/2b79ac740622218a52e2cf3ae1755dd3a8d4847a) isn't a  necessity, so might end up being dropped. \n\nThe test failure is in AppVeyor; looks like a Boost include issue. Maybe a cache needs clearing / packages need re-installing. ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19224#issuecomment-655328288,655328288,
