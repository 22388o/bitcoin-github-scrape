benma,2017-02-27T05:05:40Z,"I think the previous comment location was correct, as it is not only about this line, but all the lines that follow (the BOOST_FOREACH block below, which populates the vector). The few lines above is also needed for that.\n\nAdding `std::` only here is a bit pointless, the whole file uses vector, set, pair etc. unqualified. Even the `pair` on the same line is not qualified.\nMaybe a separate PR",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9869#discussion_r103137174,103137174,src/wallet/wallet.cpp
