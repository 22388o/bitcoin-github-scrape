laanwj,2012-05-18T21:22:59Z,I am not sure what the 'appname' in freedesktop notifications is actually used for. The specification is unclear on this: http://developer.gnome.org/notification-spec/\n\nUsing qApp name sounds like a good idea. There's no need to translate it.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1289#issuecomment-5796107,5796107,

Diapolo,2012-05-18T20:55:22Z,I took a look through the Notificator class and it is used as programName in args.append(programName); It this is the case we should perhaps remove the tr() for this and I change it back to lower-case?`@laanwj Can you help here?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1289#discussion_r847941,847941,src/qt/bitcoingui.cpp
Diapolo,2012-05-18T21:09:38Z,"I think we should just use `qApp->applicationName()` instead of `tr(""bitcoin-qt"")`.
