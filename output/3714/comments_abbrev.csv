rebroad,2014-02-22T23:23:30Z,@laanwj - can it be implemented such that the wallet is only unlocked per client?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3714#issuecomment-35818531,35818531,
laanwj,2014-02-23T08:21:50Z,@rebroad I've also though about it but that's not possible. JSON RPC (as it is now) is stateless.\nA future RPC protocol with persistent connections could (probably: should) have wallet-decryption-state per client.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3714#issuecomment-35826540,35826540,
chjj,2014-02-26T04:51:35Z,"> NACK. This introduces a statefulness that wouldn't work together with concurrent use of the API:\n\n@laanwj, you're right. I didn't even think of that. I was shortsightedly focused on solo commandline use. For now, I figure this can still be useful in situations where an assumption like this can be made though.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3714#issuecomment-36090789,36090789,
laanwj,2014-03-07T08:23:36Z,For solo command-line use you could make a script that wraps bitcoin-cli and does a `walletlock` immediately after every command. No need to make server-side changes.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3714#issuecomment-36976449,36976449,
