cozz,2014-09-03T04:14:35Z,"@TheBlueMatt I cant think of a scenario where this makes sense, can you? \n\nIn old code the signal was emitted after all the disconnects and connects. Just look at a main.cpp from the beginning of the year. \n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4798#issuecomment-54250216,54250216,
sipa,2014-09-03T14:42:35Z,"@TheBlueMatt for symmetry, I guess. But it would be extremely unlikely to matter. The locator written has exponentially-further-back block hashes, and disconnects shouldn't really be doing 1000s of blocks deep reorgs (which is the frequency at which these locators are written).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4798#issuecomment-54307488,54307488,
