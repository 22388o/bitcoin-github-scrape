Diapolo,2014-12-28T11:02:58Z,Is that function used anywhere? The build should break if you just rename it??\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5549#issuecomment-68204156,68204156,
paveljanik,2014-12-28T21:10:37Z,"The declaration of `CheckWork` is in `miner.h` only. It is not defined at all. See #4603 for more details. The new function `ProcessBlockFound` is used in `miner.cpp` only, and only after its definition, we do not need it there at all... I'd just delete the line.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5549#issuecomment-68219589,68219589,
jonasschnelli,2014-12-29T09:17:16Z,"ACK\n\nThe current defined function in `miner.h` (`bool CheckWork(CBlock* pblock, CWallet& wallet, CReserveKey& reservekey);`) as no implementation because it was renamed in #4603 (but header was not updated).\nThis PR makes totally sense.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5549#issuecomment-68242369,68242369,
jonasschnelli,2014-12-29T09:59:14Z,@bitcreditscc Even better would be to completely remove the `CheckWork()` definition in the header.\nThere is no use outside of miner.cpp.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5549#issuecomment-68244846,68244846,
