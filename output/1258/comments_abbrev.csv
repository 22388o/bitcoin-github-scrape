Diapolo,2012-05-11T10:39:04Z,"That's a fact I didn't know ... but it looks kind of weird to display 0. So all nodes have at least the genesis block, which should read 1 as minimum then. How is this handled in the core?\n\nEdit: It would be easy to change the N/A into 1.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1258#issuecomment-5648001,5648001,
sipa,2012-05-11T10:45:54Z,"No, the genesis block has height 0. getnumofpeers actually returns the median reported height reported peers. This can be 0 if most peers report 0.\n\nBut keep this pull as it is; if the number is zero it most likely means there are no peers that reported any meaningful number at all, so N/A makes that clear.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1258#issuecomment-5648097,5648097,
laanwj,2012-05-11T13:33:22Z,On the testnet it will show 0 before connecting to any peers. On the normal net it defaults to the last checkpoint (so it would only go to 0 if many peers report 0). So this is mostly useful on the testnet.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1258#issuecomment-5650579,5650579,
