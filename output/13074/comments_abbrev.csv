That commit updated part of the help text to refer to the first argument as `script`:\n\n```\n            ""1. \""script\""           (string, required) The hex-encoded script (or address)\n""\n```\n\nbut not the usage summary:\n\n```\n             ""importaddress \""address\"" ( \""label\"" rescan p2sh )\n""\n```\n\",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13074#issuecomment-384407729,384407729,
jonasschnelli,2018-04-26T07:25:57Z,"Isn't it misleading to import a `script` over a key called `address`?
