laanwj,2015-11-05T21:44:59Z,"NACK, please don't change this translation message without good reason. Spaces get collapsed on rendering anyway.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6955#discussion_r44073810,44073810,src/init.cpp
MarcoFalke,2015-11-05T21:48:30Z,Translation was triggered when I fixed MB to MiB. So it shouldn't matter?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6955#discussion_r44074260,44074260,src/init.cpp
laanwj,2015-11-05T22:13:39Z,I just think it's bullshit to change a translation message just to mess with spaces.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6955#discussion_r44077445,44077445,src/init.cpp
jonasschnelli,2015-11-06T07:30:15Z,What's the effect of removing Cpp as language? Does it autodetect c++ or is it the default in all recent clang-format versions?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6955#discussion_r44110782,44110782,src/.clang-format

But as we are only using cpp it does not matter.\n\nDoc:\n\n> The configuration file can consist of several sections each having different `Language:` parameter denoting the programming language this section of the configuration is targeted at. [...] The first section may have no language set, it will set the default style options for all lanugages.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6955#discussion_r44111314,44111314,src/.clang-format
jonasschnelli,2015-11-06T07:42:49Z,Sorry for the noise. I didn't see that in the first place. ACK.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6955#discussion_r44111371,44111371,src/.clang-format
