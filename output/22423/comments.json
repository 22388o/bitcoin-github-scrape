Put that into the first commit, due to a conflict in test_runner.py I also had to rebase the PR branch.\r\n> \r\n> Some quick suggestions for your consideration in the last commit\r\n\r\nNice, agree that this PR is also a good oportunity to change to docstrings. Took your suggestions and added you as co-author in the last commit.\r\n",
