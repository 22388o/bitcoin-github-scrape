laanwj,2015-11-10T16:19:38Z,On Ubuntu 15.10 this gives:\n\n```\nchecking whether -fPIE can be used with this Qt config... no\n```\n\nWhich is correct. However on On Ubuntu 14.04 I also get:\n\n```\nchecking whether -fPIE can be used with this Qt config... no\n```\n\nWhile I know in fact that that does work. Error in config.log is:\n\n```\nconfigure:23385: g++ -c -fPIE -g -O2 -Wall -Wextra -Wformat -Wformat-security -Wno-unus,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6978#issuecomment-155470892,155470892,
theuni,2015-11-10T20:14:40Z,"@laanwj I believe it's a Qt issue. They tightened the requirements with newer qt versions, -fPIE used to compile fine. But -fPIE + gcc5 + older Qt will still likely cause problems regardless if it does compile.\n\nSo the real issue is -fPIE + newer gcc regardless of when qt tightened the error. I think it makes sense to always fall back to -fPIC any time that reduce_relocations was used. The alter",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6978#issuecomment-155552730,155552730,

theuni,2015-11-10T21:15:22Z,"@laanwj Sorry for being unclear. To summarize the issue:\n\nQt build can enable -Bsymbolic-functions via the reduce-relocations config option. The qt devs assumed that -fPIC or -fPIE would disable copy-relocations, but gcc5 changed that behavior and allows copy-relocs with -fPIE. So -fPIC is the only way to guarantee that -Bsymbolic-functions will work as intended.\n\nSource: https://gcc.gnu.org/b",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6978#issuecomment-155568770,155568770,

anontahoe,2016-03-19T18:29:11Z,pardon me for necroing this thread but if -fPIC weakens PaX/Grsec patches then i wonder if silently using it as a fallback option is the right way to solve this.\nmaybe a clear warning can be shown and more effort undertaken to convince upstream or package maintainers to ship Qt without reduce-relocations?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6978#issuecomment-198762726,198762726,
