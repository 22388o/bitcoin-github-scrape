greenaddress,2017-07-23T23:12:51Z,I didn't review and for now neutral on the concept but why jessie and not stretch?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10903#issuecomment-317289212,317289212,
greenaddress,2017-07-23T23:14:17Z,Also rather than having lots of && which make it very unreadable why not using COPY for a bash script file and then RUN on it? the script would be reusable to setup dependency on Jessie/Stretch non docker too.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10903#issuecomment-317289292,317289292,
promag,2017-07-23T23:34:40Z,"I understand why you want this but a `Dockerfile` in the root usually is used to build the service container. The built image doesn't even have bitcoind. Also, `docker-compose.yml` has 1 service only, with the intent to avoid calling docker with those parameters.\n\nThe usage here is for development, so I would rename `Dockerfile` to `Dockerfile.dev` (or something), remove `docker-compose.yml` (",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10903#issuecomment-317290297,317290297,
