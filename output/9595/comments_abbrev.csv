theuni,2017-01-20T06:09:17Z,"concept ACK, but please don't mix in all of the include/whitespace changes.\n\nSurely that header is still needed in most cases, no? Just because it's indirectly include already doesn't mean the explicit include should be removed.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9595#issuecomment-273985723,273985723,
kallewoof,2017-01-20T06:21:18Z,@theuni Sorry about whitespace. Fixed. I went through and restored the include in the files that were using other values from `consensus/consensus.h`.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9595#issuecomment-273987161,273987161,

TheBlueMatt,2017-01-20T18:56:47Z,I generally always thought of the consensus params stuff as parameters which change between networks. Unless we want a testnet with a different parameter here I'm not sure why bother?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9595#issuecomment-274150776,274150776,
kallewoof,2017-01-20T21:02:12Z,"It never made sense to me that it was not a part of the network parameters, even if they happen to be the same for all 3 networks. (Personally I don't see why regtest requires a 100 coinbase, but that's a separate topic, I guess.)",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9595#issuecomment-274179026,274179026,
luke-jr,2017-01-20T23:34:29Z,"NACK, I agree with @morcos. There's no reason to have this specific constant as a network parameter unless we are planning to make every single constant such also.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9595#issuecomment-274208122,274208122,
kallewoof,2017-01-23T01:08:09Z,I guess you're right that it doesn't make a lot of sense and is easy enough to change if there ever is a need for a new network with a different coin base maturity.
