theuni,2014-12-08T20:19:59Z,"@Michagogo I'm not sure, as I haven't researched win32 signed binaries. This was especially easy for osx, since (nearly) the only change to the binary is a small sig insertion near the end. If win32 is the same, it's likely doable there as well. There may even be existing tools we could use. Worth looking into.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5363#issuecomment-66179860,66179860,
