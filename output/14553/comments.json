The user should not have to think about what the UI is telling him/her, it should be crystal clear.  Maybe the hourly progress increase should be removed altogether, or - better - replaced with some graphical component (like a histogram with sync speed history since the sync started).   \r\n",

    "body": "@WetPuppyKisses Thanks for commenting. \r\nYes, an explanatory tooltip could be used to tell the user what is going on. It would still need addition of a translation term, though. \r\nAnd, as I commented earlier, the message from the UI to the user should be crystal clear. If possible, no detailed explanation should be needed. UX is hard... \r\n\r\nI mentioned that a graphical component could be used. Below is an example of a download progress bar that illustrates the concept. (This is just an image I found using Google)\r\nThe user can clearly see if the sync speed has increased or decreased during the sync progress. I think that is really what the user wants/needs, as opposed to only seeing the current sync speed (and trying to remember what it was several hours ago)\r\n \r\n![9z0jt](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/453092/47412902-2e1f2400-d76d-11e8-9256-3c2e03ec5e3e.png)\r\n",
