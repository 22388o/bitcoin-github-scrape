practicalswift,2017-11-30T15:09:32Z,Added a WIP-marker: Obviously the annotation should go into `wallet.h` and not `wallet.cpp`. The problem is that the existence of `cs_main` is currently not known in `wallet.h`. What is the most appropriate way to solve that? I guess we don't want `extern CCriticalSection cs_main;` in `wallet.h`? :-),https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11799#issuecomment-348216067,348216067,
TheBlueMatt,2017-12-04T20:24:14Z,"Given that the LOCKS_EXCLUDED annotation only captures cases where the lock is taken in the same function as the call to BlockUntilSyncedToCurrentChain, I'm not sure the value of this. Indeed, obviously putting it in wallet.cpp is entirely useless, but it has only really marginal value. I'm open to discussion about whether its worth an extern CCriticalSection cs_main in wallet.h for this.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11799#issuecomment-349093761,349093761,
