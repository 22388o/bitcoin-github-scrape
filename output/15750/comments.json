In the Perl 5 Core world, we do anything we can to ensure backward compatibility, which means you can run 99.9% of programs from before Bitcoin was invented on the latest Perl 5 release.\r\n\r\nMy :-1: was to show that some \"consistency\" changes might look nice from inside the walls of Core, but they have many negative effects to 3rd parties that just want to have a stable RPC API.\r\n\r\nI don't expect this to change minds, but hopefully it helps inform future decisions of supporting backward compatibility. \r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "@leto - thanks for your input. I understand your point about maintaining compatibility for clients, and it's definitely something that the contributors take into consideration. That needs to be weighed against other considerations like making the RPCs consistent and not confusing for users. The `addresses` field in this RPC return object was confusing. How can an address have multiple addresses?\r\n\r\nThe reason these RPC methods have been modified in recent versions is justified in #10583. Originally, `validateaddress` accessed data and functionality in both the wallet and node. Splitting it into `getaddressinfo` and `validateaddress` allow us to move forward with properly modularising the codebase. Not making that change would preclude very useful changes such as #10973, which make the code more maintainable, allowing us to more quickly and safely make changes to the code that benefit all users.\r\n\r\nWe try to make the transition as painless as possible for clients by marking features as deprecated for at least one release before removing them. Anyone still using the `addresses` field in v0.17 would have to have set the `deprecatedrpc=validateaddress` option, and so would know that the field would be removed shortly.\r\n\r\nFinally, Bitcoin Core is an open source project, so if you really do rely on the `addresses` field (I can't see how that's possible since the data is available in other fields), you have several options:\r\n- Don't upgrade and continue using the V0.17.x version\r\n- Maintain a fork of the software that meets your particular needs\r\n- Write a shim that sits in front of the RPC server to maintain compatibility.",
