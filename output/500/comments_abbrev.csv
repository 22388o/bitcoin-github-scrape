sipa,2011-09-06T18:22:16Z,"I think this should not be a reference, as it would make the test on line 464 always fail.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/500#discussion_r114638,114638,src/net.cpp
gavinandresen,2011-09-06T23:44:07Z,Huh?  The reference gets reassigned on line 463...\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/500#discussion_r115142,115142,src/net.cpp
sipa,2011-09-07T00:19:00Z,"You can't change what a reference refers to. The assignment operator (except for initialization) only overwrites the value referred to. Maybe you want a pointer, which gives you control over what is referenced.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/500#discussion_r115180,115180,src/net.cpp
gavinandresen,2011-09-07T00:25:55Z,"Right you are, thanks for telling me I'm an idiot gently.  Fixed (changed addrFound to a plain-old CAddress).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/500#discussion_r115185,115185,src/net.cpp
