Empact,2020-01-30 02:49:41,"Would be helpful to comment on ""why"" in each commit message - e.g. I was curious to look into why the `FuzzedDataProvider.h` update was necessary and found that the `ConsumeFloatingPoint` was introduced [recently](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/df3b465c9c4fed5045470d3eb5b65c14e6de71e6#diff-09bd829935aa18be3ed32f464a607c3bR211-R214). https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#why-not-how",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18009#issuecomment-580059989,580059989,
MarcoFalke,2020-01-27 19:38:43,"Why can this not be run in `case 0`? Seems odd to require the fuzzer to pick a path, when both of them can be run subsequently",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18009#discussion_r371441873,371441873,src/test/fuzz/strprintf.cpp
MarcoFalke,2020-01-27 19:41:22,"Why are the nullptr things under `case 2` and `case 3`? Seems odd to put them there, when nothing needs to be parsed. They can be executed outside of any `case`, no?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18009#discussion_r371443148,371443148,src/test/fuzz/strprintf.cpp
MarcoFalke,2020-01-27 19:42:02,Same here and for all cases below,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18009#discussion_r371443527,371443527,src/test/fuzz/strprintf.cpp
