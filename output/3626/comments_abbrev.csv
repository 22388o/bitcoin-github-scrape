cozz,2014-02-04T22:28:25Z,"Issue #2862 was about the old-receive-tab. Actually you can resize the last column in the new receive tab, but you have to move your mouse to the right end of the column. I wouldnt expect it there either, but it works for me.\n\nIn the addressbookpage.cpp, we have set ResizeToContents on the last column, to ensure its contents are always visible. I think this might be a good idea for the new recei",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3626#issuecomment-34115221,34115221,
gubatron,2014-02-04T23:52:08Z,""" Actually you can resize the last column in the new receive tab, but you have to move your mouse to the right end of the column."" yes, I noticed this when I made the first change, I've put all these in comments I believe. You can now grab in between the last two columns an resize from there. It responds also to window resizing, etc. \n\nIf you build this branch you'll see that it works flawlessly",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3626#issuecomment-34122666,34122666,
laanwj,2014-02-05T07:56:11Z,@gubatron This indeed solves the issue but at the cost of micromanaging every aspect of Qt sizing. This adds a lot of low-level code to the dialog for such a minor change. Can it be generalized and moved to (a class in) guiutils somehow?\n\n@cozz Please don't use resizeToContents on the transactions tab or any other table that may grow big. As Qt has to look at every single row in the model to dec,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3626#issuecomment-34144526,34144526,
gubatron,2014-02-05T20:29:00Z,@laanwj fair enough. I'llI do that. Thanks for pointing me in the right direction as I'm very new to the codebase. Once I've been able to generalize a solution and put it in guiutils I'll apply to all the tables I see have the same issue (if you don't mind).\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3626#issuecomment-34236308,34236308,
