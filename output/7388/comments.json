I do however think this due to a misunderstanding:\n- It's perfectly possible to keep accepting 0-conf transactions, if you believe they are safe for your use case. Opt-in RBF sets a non-maximum nSequence value, which causes many providers to already consider the transaction non-standard for the purpose of accepting 0-conf.\n- As a customer, you can choose to set opt-in RBF, and thus lose the ability to get your payment accepted before confirmation, but with the ability to easily change the fee afterwards or combine the transaction with others.\n- As a miner, the rational behaviour is to take the transaction with the highest fee (even for non opt-in cases). If you don't, another miner can.\n\nAnd, no, opt-in RBF is not theft. It's indicating that you're not sure whether what you're submitting is the final form of the transaction. This is the exact semantics that nSequence had since the earliest version of Bitcoin.\n",

That would be possible.\n\nBut most (all) wallets do already treat unconfirmed transactions/balance as **unconfirmed**. People should really not rely on **unconfirmed** balance. It's **unconfirmed**. ~~As recently shown by Peter Todd, it's quite easy to double spend your transaction, and this was without RBF being deployed.~~ If they rely on 0-conf they should use a merchant tools which includes risk analysis. \n\nIf you are selling services or goods after you have received a 0-conf transaction, you should be very careful with handing out the good/service while the transaction is **not confirmed** and you should certainly not use a standard wallet (you would take a very high risk). \n",

So we better also make sure it is as safe as possible. \n\nMy personal view is that Opt-in RBF improves zero-conf by making it very clear what can and can't be replaced.

A wallet user is a financial actor.  The question is not whether they will spend those particular received bitcoins, but what actions they will or may take on the receipt of those bitcoins.  At the ery minimum the wallet GUI should expose whether the transaction (or one of its ancestors) was opted in - this functionality shouldn't be limited just to RPC IMHO.\n",

    "body": "> So this OP_RETURN hard fork incompatibility is now an attack vector\n> against 0-conf spends, by someone who has already publicly defrauded\n> Coinbase using a double spend attack.\n\nEvery policy change (and it's not a hard fork or an incompatibility, just a\nchange in what transactions get relayed) introduces an increased chance for\nsuccesfully double spending. That's inevitable. Worse, it can't be\nprevented, as anyone can change their software to modify policy.\n\nI'm sure you don't want to never change policy rules, though. We used to\nhave a minimum 0.01 BTC rule, for example. Should that never have been\nremoved?\n\nPolicy changes are sometimes necessary, so the temporary differences in\nwhat nodes relay too. You can however personally make the judgement that a\n0-conf transaction is acceptable to you. Perhaps because you trust the\nsender. Perhaps because you can undo what you do in return if it fails to\nconfirm. And perhaps because you're doing analysis of the transaction to\nestimate the chances, or let someone do it for you. And if you do the\nlatter, you should take the nSequence value into account, because it\n_already_ and _since Bitcoin 0.1_ is used in determining whether the\ntransaction was final.\n",

    "body": "@stale2000 By no means is this a new feature. Replacing transactions was originally in Satoshi's first version. Since this is node policy, not consensus (it won't cause a fork). Where does the majority of the community disagree? Are they disagreeing because they don't understand how Opt-In works?\n\n@sandakersmann by that logic any implementation of Bitcoin and any new feature added and any new feature planned is \"central planning\". If that didn't happen, nothing would get done and we wouldn't see new features.\n\nHow are they interfering with the free block space market? By not deploying a hard fork to increase the block size limit right now? Soft forks can be problematic, hard forks can be worse. They have good reason to avoid hard forks. Anyways, this is off topic.\n\nNACK for this PR\n",

Since 99% of node operators do not change the default settings, this has been a safe-enough (not 100% safe obviously) assumption.\n\nThis change radically changes that assumption as retailers must now use wallets with advanced new RBF features.  They must also come up with new workflows to deal with clientele who accidentally flag transactions as RBF.  Most retailers wont bother with this hassle (at best) and potentially ignorant retailers will lose a lot of money (at worst). This policy change (and by policy i am referring to the default settings since 99% of node operators will not change the defaults) is the equivalent of a nuclear bomb on the retailer community.  \n",

    "body": "@sandakersmann I have read that comment. \n\n> It is not us that should show you that services for 0-conf acceptance have implemented discard function for non-final nSequence values. This is something that you should know all about and show us before you implement such dramatic changes to policy.\n\nSipa is saying that there are no services which accept 0-conf transactions that accept non-final transactions. Since opt-in makes it non-final, they are already prepared for that. He (and everyone else on the team) has already looked at the services and have already determined that they all already deal with non-final transactions. He is saying that you would not be able to find any service that doesn't already deal with those non-final 0-conf transactions because they all do.\n\n> I think it is really bad the way you guys are trying to force bitcoin into lightningcoin. Stealing fees from the miners will kill the long term viability of the Bitcoin network.\n\nHow is it stealing fees from miners? If anything, it increases fees for them.\n\n> You can see what the community thinks of RBF here:\n\nHow accurate is that survey? Does it accurately survey and represent the entire population? Do those who were part of that survey actually know what Opt-In RBF even means?\n\n@skajake Any service who already accepts 0-conf transactions will already check for certain things to be sure that the incoming transaction will be confirmed. One of them is the nSequence, and if it is not MAX_INT, then the transaction is non-final. Even if they do not upgrade, this code is already there because an nSequence that is not MAX_INT is already considered non-final and thus dangerous to accept 0-conf on. Thus that is irrelevant.\n\nAlso, if they only accept transactions with confirmations (as many do), then this doesn't matter to the retailer.\n",

It makes sense for them to choose to disable it by personal preference as someone who doesn't know or care about RBF wouldn't be affected in the slightest.\n\nWallets regardless of this change will have to still be safe, and educate about 0-conf and RBF.

The last thing we should be doing is making it harder it scarier for businesses to interact with or accept Bitcoin transactions. Of course someone with @petertodds level of skill can double spend, but businesses accept risk of counteroffer money being used for purchases but governments aren't making a huge issue about it so they self regulate those risks. If the news cycle were to suddenly start talking about the potential risks for accepting cash if would cause China's and confusion. Just as RBF is doing. \n\nThis is bad for Bitcoin and having this turned on as a default is bad for Bitcoin. \n\nDid devs talk to merchants about this. Because a lot of people in the retail space think this is horrible.\n",

Or are you referring to dev consensus as consensus?  \n\nIf you are that's fine, but I feel like consensus is a word often used by devs about devs. I think this is a problem as consensus is tossed around a lot in here. For instance devs re: RBF talk about having had consensus months ago. Should we not strive for a much more robust definition of consensus to be used going forward? Maybe that way we can avoid a separation in dev consensus and user consensus that Jeff is referring to that can be seen in the consider.it polling.\n",

    "body": "> This is bad for Bitcoin and having this turned on as a default is bad for Bitcoin.\n\nHaving the possibility of opt-in RBF does not mean that transactions are created with RBF opt-in by default. As far as I know, no wallets have this possibility at this point at all, let alone do it by default. \n\nHowever, transactions that do opt-in to RBF are distinguishable (that's the whole point of opt-in versus full RBF), so a merchant that normally accept zero-conf can take that into account and only accept the transaction when it has confirmed. There's no extra risk when doing so.\n\nIt just increases flexibility to have this available. There are lots of complaints about stuck transactions that never confirm. WIth opt-in RBF it is possible to raise the fee on existing transactions (that opted in), so that transactions that initially had too little fee make it into the block chain.\n\nBy arguing to disable this you are killing a useful feature. No one will dare touch this again one it is disabled.\n",

Has there been any (I really hope the answer is yes) surveying of experts in the bitcoin retail sector on how they feel about RBF and especially about it being defaulted as \"on.\"  All I am hearing outside of devs on here is that it is not wanted. The only people saying it is useful are devs or non-retail related individuals. If I am wrong great. But I am simply looking at the evidence available.\n\nIf you are bound and determined to make this change, isn't it reasonable to give people the option to \"opt in\" (all the way around, not just on one side) instead of opting out of something they simply may not understand or want?\n",

I'm pretty sure you can do something similar with consider.it or with github ACKs.\n\nWe should **not** start public voting for high complex technical discussions unless every bitcoin users _must_ vote and _must_ spend two days reading and studying the technical topic.

But if you think the latter is a case for, then why do you think it is that no one is double spending? (outside of @petertodd)? And can you possible see how people feel that there is a solution looking for a problem? In other words, \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it.\"?\n",

This is a clear solution for a clear problem, but it is not all. There are also more advanced contracts/applications that require RBF.\n\nI support _opt-in_ RBF because it allows those parties which prefer the old status quo to still do their thing.

Maybe no one wants to screw you. Maybe the (perceived) cost of doing so is much higher than what is to be gained. Maybe bitcoin users, despite being universally portrayed as criminals in the media, aren't that bad and just want this to work. Do I know?\n\nIn any case allowing opt-in RBF won't change this.

Maybe there is a lesson to learn here: full RBF has been implemented for years but never merged because it was \"controversial\". After long, the more complex opt-in RBF was developed, with the goal to remove  those \"controversies\", but it turns out it is unexplicably \"controversial anyway. Maybe we should have just deployed full RBF years ago...\n\nThat, plus changing defaults for configurable values is usually a waste of time that mostly just generates noise and long discussion threads like this one. Nobody is forced to use the default values.\nAnybody can make a parallel release (analogous to @petertodd's RBF parallel release) with the \"right defaults\" to promote whatever relay policy they like more instead of bike-shedding defaults here.\n\nNACK.\n",

I sincerely hope you are trolling\n\nYou've been fed a false history. Full RBF was the original proposal, which was too controversial to be widely adapted. Opt-in RBF was proposed as a compromise to make both RBF supporters and the status quo happy. If the compromise fails, both groups go back to their extremes. People that want to use RBF will do so, by the means available (the full RBF patch). In contrast to this compromise, that doesn't need to be widely adapted (or \"forced down the throats of users\", who's trolling?) to be useful. But it is much more \"dangerous\" as it contains no flagging of transactions that can be replaced.\n",

Some people were operating under the assumption that first seen policy can be a consensus  rule or is universally deployed as policy. That's false and extremely dangerous.\nAlso what @laanwj said abot the history. All I'm saying is that if opt-in RBF doesn't  solve the only problem full RBF had IMO (being controversial ) then we could have as well not gone through the effort of removing all potential sources of controversy (that's why I understand optin does compared to full) because although the logic has changed the policy still contains \"RBF\" in its name whic is (from what I can read in this PR) the real reason why opt-in RBF is controversial  (haven't all other on-topic concerns risen here been refuted?).\n",

Hence, it solving the double spend problem. \n\nSatoshi was clear on the first-seen-safe policy as a risk reducer. The context of a violation of that rule is that the minor confirming a double spent transaction either did not see the first one OR the minor is dishonest. Those are the only two options. Discovery of dishonesty is a deterrent. In an ideal mining context there are thousands of nodes creating blocks and their operators run honest code. In today's mining context with so few nodes creating blocks we can identify the dishonest nodes who are accepting a bribe to assist in theft.
