TheBlueMatt,2017-10-02T19:57:02Z,"Wait, now I'm even more confused. AFAICT, dumpwallet *does* dump all imported keys, not just ""derived"" keys, so no need to back those up. It does not, however, dump imported scripts, so witness addresses and multisig addresses will be missed, right?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11289#issuecomment-333646789,333646789,
meshcollider,2017-10-02T21:52:52Z,"That's what I meant by `(e.g. ensure you back up the whole dumpfile)` (note that I didn't follow the suggested edit by mess110 because it's wrong, is that what you were looking at?).
