Switching the primitives in the sync module from boost to std should be done in an atomic commit, without doing any other change.\r\n\r\nI didn't know about this pull request before opening issue #11166 (from which you referred me here), I'm pretty close to having that ready to open a pull request, (just changing boost to std). Will update here when it's ready. I think it'd be better if that were reviewed and merged, and only then follow up with other changes. \r\nEDIT: Opened pull request #11199 ",

If you've seen https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11599, the name should make more sense in this context. I think Lock and Mutex are the right names because they match the standard. As you mentioned, you can implement DEBUG_LOCKORDER with them and also do other things useful for debugging, like printing differences in a data structure between time a particular mutex is locked & unlocked.",
