    "body": "gitian is the deterministic build system we use, that sets up a virtual machine environment with known versions of EVERYTHING and then builds in such a way that bit-for-bit identical .exes come out of multiple developer's machines.  It means anybody can verify that we are using the source code we're saying we are to build the executables that we distribute (except for Mac, everybody has to trust me because we can't gitian-build the Mac release yet).\n\nSource code for the gitian-build process is in contrib/gitian-descriptors/\nWindows builds use deps-win32.yml boost-win32.yml qt-win32.yml and gitian-win32.yml\nIf you want builds to use a different version of something, you (or somebody) needs to change one or more of those files.\n",
