Diapolo,2013-11-08T07:01:52Z,I would rather call this `getUri()`.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3215#discussion_r7520387,7520387,src/qt/openuridialog.cpp

laanwj,2013-11-08T07:54:11Z,"I don't  agree with the capitalization. We use URI in uppercase in the interface everywhere: parseBitcoinURI, formatBitcoinURI, handleURIConnection, ... Uri is used nowhere at all.\n\nAs for getURI() / URI(), meh, Qt itself doesn't add `get` for properties either. Example: QLineEdit text() / setText(). But we do it in other places in the gui. Fine with me really.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3215#discussion_r7520895,7520895,src/qt/openuridialog.cpp
