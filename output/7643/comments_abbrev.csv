MarcoFalke,2016-03-05T17:17:03Z,"NACK, I like the previous code better because the ""formatting"" is uniform. Also, I am pretty sure the compiler will remove this case. Apart from that, agree with @theuni \n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7643#issuecomment-192689813,192689813,

jonasschnelli,2016-03-04T17:18:22Z,IMO this results in the same (remove code) as above.\nThe L66 EVP function only gets executed when fOk is true (which is always true at L66). fOk will then be set to true if the EVP function did not return 0.\n\nI think the current code works right.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7643#discussion_r55058873,55058873,src/wallet/crypter.cpp
