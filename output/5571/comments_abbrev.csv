luke-jr,2014-12-30T10:45:30Z,What about computers without right mouse buttons (grr Apple...)?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5571#issuecomment-68346950,68346950,
jonasschnelli,2014-12-30T11:54:57Z,ACK\n\n@luke-jr: Even in Apple-Land the right mouse button has arrived. If one still sticks with a old apple one-button-mouse he can press ctrl-left-mouse to trigger a right mouse button event.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5571#issuecomment-68350771,68350771,
