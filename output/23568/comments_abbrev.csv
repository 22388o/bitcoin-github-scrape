laanwj,2021-11-26 15:43:59,I think we're generally trying to avoid having newlines in translation messages? @hebasto ,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23568#discussion_r757591944,757591944,src/net.cpp
hebasto,2021-11-27 16:16:00,"Yes. As I mentioned in https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/pull/476#issuecomment-974891494, we cannot be sure that the chosen location of the hardcoded `\n` is optimal for translated strings.\n\nIf the problem is the breaking `-listen=0`, why do not use a nonbreaking hyphen:\n```suggestion\n                _(""Failed to listen on any port. Use \u2011listen=0 if you want this.""),\n```\n?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23568#discussion_r757796027,757796027,src/net.cpp
katesalazar,2021-11-27 16:40:55,"Breaking text at the end of the sentence would be cutest.\n(at least at that macOS build).\nBreaking text before `-listen=0` is good enough as a first step.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23568#discussion_r757798239,757798239,src/net.cpp
