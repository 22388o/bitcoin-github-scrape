mrbandrews,2016-06-22T17:52:09Z,"I don't feel strongly about it, but I probably prefer the simplicity of 7886.  I think the caller's usual expectation would be to get a unique coinbase, even for the same height and same pubkey (which would be reused for convenience, not because the test code is thinking of a single miner producing all the blocks).  I verified the assertion in 7886 that it doesn't break any of the existing tests.\",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7914#issuecomment-227824060,227824060,
