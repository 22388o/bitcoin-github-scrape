theuni,2014-10-13T20:07:39Z,@TheBlueMatt pointed out some problems here wrt the -lmingwthrd change. It now looks to me like this could've broken exception handling in some cases. Much like https://bitcoin.org/en/alert/2012-03-16-critical-vulnerability . I'm going to work on creating a test-case for this before making any changes.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5081#issuecomment-58947254,58947254,
