morcos,2015-11-03T21:35:36Z,"I think most of the pull makes sense, but I'd save removing the AbsurdFee check until we replace it with something better.  Having the only effective high fee check be the ATMP check is dicey since that depends on minRelayTxFee which people might be adjusting for other reasons.  Also I'm not sure how this is meant to work with #6726.  I don't like the idea of having less and less checks for accide",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6887#issuecomment-153496800,153496800,
laanwj,2015-11-04T10:27:16Z,"I agree with @morcos. The absurdfee check is just a belt-and-suspenders check, in case something goes wrong due to a bug in another part of the code. I don't feel good about removing it.\nI also don't think that change belongs in a ""Update coin control and smartfee labels"" pull.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6887#issuecomment-153673767,153673767,

jonasschnelli,2015-10-29T19:01:50Z,Sad to see another coupling between the Wallet and the Mempool/Node. But it's already all over.\nIdeally the wallet should not directly access global mempool variables instead it should get data over a general interface.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6887#discussion_r43429941,43429941,src/wallet/wallet.cpp
