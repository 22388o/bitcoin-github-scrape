MarcoFalke,2021-04-30 09:14:17,"Yeah, this relies on the ""synchronisation-effect"" of `assert_debug_log`, which I generally dislike because it makes tests harder to read. Though, I couldn't find another solution without modifying bitcoind.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21814#issuecomment-829959854,829959854,

Maybe it could be more apparent by having an explicitly named function (or add a comment?) that synchronizes on a debug log message, but I *like* using a trigger on process output for synchronization instead of say, polling RPC in a loop.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21814#issuecomment-832744201,832744201,
