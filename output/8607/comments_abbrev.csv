A few lines down we're even calling _perl_ from Python. \n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8607#discussion_r76511331,76511331,contrib/devtools/fix-copyright-headers.py

Popen, by default, just invokes the process directly. See e.g. how `github-merge.py` interacts with git.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8607#discussion_r76530745,76530745,contrib/devtools/fix-copyright-headers.py
