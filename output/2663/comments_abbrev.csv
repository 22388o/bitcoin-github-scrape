gmaxwell,2013-05-17T17:41:10Z,"This is the wrong thing to do.  We need specific sizes for specific normative behavior in many places, not all systems use the same sizes for primitive types. The stdint.h _t named size types are standards specified by SUS and in C++11.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2663#issuecomment-18075646,18075646,
pshep,2013-05-17T18:01:30Z,"Ah right. Compiling for another platform and these aren't defined - throws errors. Searched the rest of the bitcoin code and saw no other instances of *_t being used.

luke-jr,2013-05-17T19:34:46Z,"Eventually, it would be nice to migrate everything bit-specific to the standard [u]intN_t types, but the last attempt to do so had some issues. In addition to C++11, stdint.h was also part of C99 (1999, over 13 years ago) - perhaps you can get the header that way somehow?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2663#issuecomment-18081749,18081749,
