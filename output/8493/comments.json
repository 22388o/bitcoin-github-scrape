    "body": "Yes, there's no other clean way now.\nI still lament not having even followed my own plan of keeping Consensus::Params as C-compatible as possible...by forgetting namespaces (really, thanks @luke-jr for pointing that out).\n\nBut yeah, I've previously discussed with @NicolasDorier that we could wrap all fields in something like struct BlockIndexInterface https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8493/commits/fb9692bc74a38233c082d90566051a5ea7eb6537 around set_pointer_function_for_pseudo_method_x() style functions as an interface and that would work similarly to not wrapping it with some small advantages even if we wanted to have the inside written in C, which I don't realistically think about anymore in any case.\n\nIn this case, as you say, it is as easy as two functions: create_params() and destroy_params().\n\nThanks @luke-jr @sipa @NicolasDorier for this tremendously useful feedback.\n",

For convenience, one can see the changes without the moveonly in: https://github.com/jtimon/bitcoin/compare/0.12.99-consensus-moveonly-header...jtimon:0.13-consensus-header\n\nAs discussed:\n- consensus/params.h is no longer included by script/bitcoinconsensus.h: bitcoinconsensus_create_consensus_parameters and bitcoinconsensus_destroy_consensus_parameters are created instead.\n- This also saves all the preparations for using a 32 byte array instead of a uint256 in Consensus::Params since its only going to be exposed in the create function: no need to disrupt any of the 3 hashes in Consensus::Params nor the convenience method. Quite a few diffs have been saved here, thanks again.\n\nThe TODOs will be updated at the end of the OP, but here's the current summary:\n- finish implementing bitcoinconsensus_create_consensus_parameters (and remove whatever is not needed anymore from the base_blob<> preparations).\n- The interface for CBlockIndex (`const BlockIndexInterface* iBlockIndex`) could be hidden in libconsensus using the same create/destroy blockindexInterfaceTrick, even if some of the parameters are going to be function pointers. Or we could offer both and see what happens...discussion welcomed here, but allowing BlockIndexInterface\\* to be passed as void\\* it's in the todo list whether for necessary or just to see how it looks like.\n- new warnings\n",
