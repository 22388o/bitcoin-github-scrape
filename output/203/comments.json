    "body": "well, keeping the keys encrypted in ram as a method to prevent other processes from reading it is pretty useless unless we manage to lock out all other processes from accessing our memory. reasking the password at spending-time is a good opt-in setting, but doesn't require keeping the keys encrypted in ram.\nso If I had to choose I'd definitely say wallet encryption over privkey encryption in ram.\nit would probably make more sense to have an hardware token (something like one of these http://www.hacker10.com/tag/hardware-security-token/ ) storing the privkey and doing the actual signing (so that the privkey never leaves it).\n",
