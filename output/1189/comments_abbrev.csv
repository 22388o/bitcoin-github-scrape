laanwj,2012-05-04T06:33:56Z,Can you please move the checking logic to WalletModel instead of inside SetAddressBookName? That'd make it an UI-only change and much easier to test.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1189#issuecomment-5505050,5505050,
Diapolo,2012-05-04T06:49:38Z,"The question is, if walletmodel.cpp is the only place, where that check makes senes or if it's beneficial to all places in the source? I'm fine if it's only needed in walletmodel.cpp, so can you verify this?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1189#issuecomment-5505197,5505197,
laanwj,2012-05-04T07:26:05Z,"Well, it'd be nice to only change only the UI for an UI-only fix.\n\nThen again, I guess the extra check doesn't hurt (except that it complicates the code a bit).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1189#issuecomment-5505575,5505575,
Diapolo,2012-05-04T08:44:39Z,"@laanwj Updated to be a GUI-fix only, is the LOCK in parentheses correct? I get now compiler warning, just want to be sure :)\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1189#issuecomment-5506494,5506494,
laanwj,2012-05-04T08:46:45Z,"The LOCK is not correct. You need to have the lock before any access to the address book, so also while doing the check.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1189#issuecomment-5506518,5506518,
Diapolo,2012-05-04T09:10:42Z,"Alright, the LOCK is now before any access to wallet, locking good now?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1189#issuecomment-5506791,5506791,
laanwj,2012-05-04T09:55:38Z,"Yes, it's ok now\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1189#issuecomment-5507403,5507403,
