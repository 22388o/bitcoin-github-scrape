Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate\n-with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried\n-out collectively by the network. Bitcoin Core is the name of open source\n-software which enables the use of this currency.\n-\n-For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of\n-the Bitcoin Core software, see https://bitcoin.org/en/download, or read the\n-[original whitepaper](https://bitcoincore.org/bitcoin.pdf).\n-\n-License\n--------\n-\n-Bitcoin Core is released under the terms of the MIT license. See [COPYING](COPYING) for more\n-information or see https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT.\n-\n-Development Process\n--------------------\n-\n-The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be\n-completely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tags) are created\n-regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of Bitcoin Core.\n-\n-The contribution workflow is described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n-\n-The developer [mailing list](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/bitcoin-dev)\n-should be used to discuss complicated or controversial changes before working\n-on a patch set.\n-\n-Developer IRC can be found on Freenode at #bitcoin-core-dev.\n-\n-Testing\n--------\n-\n-Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull\n-requests than we can review and test on short notice. Please be patient and help out by testing\n-other people's pull requests, and remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people\n-lots of money.\n-\n-### Automated Testing\n-\n-Developers are strongly encouraged to write [unit tests](src/test/README.md) for new code, and to\n-submit new unit tests for old code. Unit tests can be compiled and run\n-(assuming they weren't disabled in configure) with: `make check`. Further details on running\n-and extending unit tests can be found in [/src/test/README.md](/src/test/README.md).\n-\n-There are also [regression and integration tests](/test), written\n-in Python, that are run automatically on the build server.\n-These tests can be run (if the [test dependencies](/test) are installed) with: `test/functional/test_runner.py`\n-\n-The Travis CI system makes sure that every pull request is built for Windows, Linux, and OS X, and that unit/sanity tests are run automatically.\n-\n-### Manual Quality Assurance (QA) Testing\n-\n-Changes should be tested by somebody other than the developer who wrote the\n-code. This is especially important for large or high-risk changes. It is useful\n-to add a test plan to the pull request description if testing the changes is\n-not straightforward.\n-\n-Translations\n-------------\n-\n-Changes to translations as well as new translations can be submitted to\n-[Bitcoin Core's Transifex page](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/bitcoin/).\n-\n-Translations are periodically pulled from Transifex and merged into the git repository. See the\n-[translation process](doc/translation_process.md) for details on how this works.\n-\n-**Important**: We do not accept translation changes as GitHub pull requests because the next\n-pull from Transifex would automatically overwrite them again.\n-\n-Translators should also subscribe to the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bitcoin-translators).\n+Anvil Coin is the future of decentalised crypto exchange."
