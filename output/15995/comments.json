Unlike the `StateDirectory` directory the ownership of the `ConfigurationDirectoryMode`  does not get updated automatically by systemd, from the [systemd reference]:(https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.exec.html#ConfigurationDirectory=):\r\n\r\n> Except in case of ConfigurationDirectory=, the innermost specified directories will be owned by the user and group specified in User= and Group=.

That way at least the service script won't create it with incorrect permissions and it will be left up to the user to do so as they see fit, most likely with themselves as the owner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

If the `/etc/bitcoin` directory was created by `systemd` with `root` ownership and `0755` permissions, the just created `bitcoin.conf` file (e.g., `touch /etc/bitcoin/bitcoin.conf`) will acquire the same permissions. It means `bitcoin.conf` will be readable for all users.\r\n\r\n2. This PR looks like a bad trade-off between first-time setup convenience for long-term security.\r\n\r\n3. [The best practice](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/init.md) is:\r\n> The configuration file, PID directory (if applicable) and data directory should all be owned by the bitcoin user and group. It is advised for security reasons to make the configuration file and data directory only readable by the bitcoin user and group. Access to bitcoin-cli and other bitcoind rpc clients can then be controlled by group membership.\r\n\r\n@sipsorcery \r\n> the PR doesn't affect the permissions on the bitcoin.conf file.\r\n\r\nYes, it does.

    "body": "Ok I'll accept that the proposed solution is not ideal and close this PR. \r\n\r\nIn my defense I will point out that my goal was to avoid future users of the sample systemd `bitcoind.service` script receiving the error below.  I reasoned that if I, as a someone with a bit of programmer experience under my belt, was having difficulties then so would others that tried to use the script. That could certainly be a wrong assumption.\r\n\r\nThis is the error that occurs if I take the same steps I've use to set up dozens of systemd services on Ubuntu.\r\n\r\n````\r\n~$ tail /var/lib/bitcoind/debug.log -f\r\n2019-07-05T18:43:54Z Using data directory /var/lib/bitcoind\r\n2019-07-05T18:43:54Z\r\n\r\n************************\r\nEXCEPTION: N5boost10filesystem16filesystem_errorE\r\nboost::filesystem::status: Permission denied: \"/etc/bitcoin/bitcoin.conf\"\r\nbitcoin in AppInit()\r\n\r\n2019-07-05T18:43:54Z Shutdown: In progress...\r\n2019-07-05T18:43:54Z Shutdown: done\r\n````\r\n\r\n@hebasto You are right*. \r\n*Unless the `bitcoin.conf` file already exists with the correct ownership. From the systemd [manual](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.exec.html#ConfigurationDirectory=):\r\n\r\n> Except in case of ConfigurationDirectory=, the innermost specified directories will be owned by the user and group specified in User= and Group=. If the specified directories already exist and their owning user or group do not match the configured ones, all files and directories below the specified directories as well as the directories themselves will have their file ownership recursively changed to match what is configured. As an optimization, if the specified directories are already owned by the right user and group, files and directories below of them are left as-is, even if they do not match what is requested. The innermost specified directories will have their access mode adjusted to the what is specified in RuntimeDirectoryMode=, StateDirectoryMode=, CacheDirectoryMode=, LogsDirectoryMode= and ConfigurationDirectoryMode=.\r\n\r\nThere's too much beer to drink to worry about `710 || 755` :).\r\n",

    "body": "Just stumbled across this same issue and contributed my own fix with `711` (rather than `755`). On the one hand I see the problem with having the config file world-readable due to RPC secrets; on the other hand, if one wants to run with the default settings and doesn't care about putting a `bitcoin.conf` in `/etc/bitcoin` the current systemd service file simply creates the the directory with the wrong permissions. I think @ryanofsky's `chgrp` suggestion is the best of both worlds, will experiment with that and update my PR if it works.",

    "body": "I disagree with some points made in this discussion.\r\n\r\n@hebasto \r\n> Providing `-conf=/etc/bitcoin/bitcoin.conf` option in `ExecStart=/usr/bin/bitcoind` line of `bitcoind.service` file assumes setting up `/etc/bitcoin/bitcoin.conf` before bitcoind service get started.\r\n\r\nFalse; this just sets the location where `bitcoind` will look for the configuration; `bitcoind` does not require the config file. Without `-conf=/etc/bitcoin/bitcoin.conf`, `bitcoind` would default to iiuc `$HOME/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf` (with `$HOME` set by the `bitcoin` user), preventing further hardening measures such as `ProtectHome=true` (assuming the `bitcoin` user's home dir is `/home/bitcoin`).\r\n\r\n> 3. The best practice is:\r\n> `The configuration file, PID directory (if applicable) and data directory should all be owned by the bitcoin user and group. It is advised for security reasons to make the configuration file and data directory only readable by the bitcoin user and group. Access to bitcoin-cli and other bitcoind rpc clients can then be controlled by group membership.`\r\n\r\nThis looks like it might also need fixing; there is no point to separating the config file out from the writeable datadir if you are going to make the config dir writeable by the user executing the service; making the config file readable but not writeable by the user executing the service is the whole point of having separate data- and config dirs; this is also why systemd does not `chown` the `ConfigurationDirectory` to the `User` and `Group` specified in the service file.",
