sipa,2019-05-15 04:43:17,"@gmaxwell It's not as simple. It seems that the actually implemented policy will actually reject spends where any uncompressed key is encountered, even if it's not one that contributes to the validity of OP_CHECKMULTISIG(VERIFY). If all signatures match up with the first k keys, and those are compressed, then the rest can be uncompressed.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16022#issuecomment-492501085,492501085,
