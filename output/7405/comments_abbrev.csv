jonasschnelli,2016-01-24T16:01:53Z,Only critical bugs should be back ported IMO. We are already in rc2 stage.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7405#issuecomment-174311740,174311740,
laanwj,2016-01-25T13:09:28Z,Agree with @jonasschnelli. On the other hand the risk of this introducing a regression is low.\n\nThis is something that could be merged if we need to do a rc3 in the first place and won't label rc2 as final.\nOtherwise it could be merged after final for 0.12.1.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7405#issuecomment-174504236,174504236,
