    "body": "A third thought:  extend the whitelist interface so that an ACL entry can specify the port that it was connected _to_, then instead of trusted bind you'd be able to just bind multiple ports and write whitelist entries like 0/0:1234.\n\nI still suspect that special casing localhost to prevent banning is something we want to do, even for onion peers. Banning all onion peers because one behaves is the wrong behavior (and creates a vulnerability where we currently have none: a single trouble maker could turn off bitcoin on tor cheaply, in order to be able to deanonymize users when they drop off tor to get things working).\n",

We can still use Tor when it works and hope that some attacker that is willing to very noisily interfere with the entire network to force people back onto the clearnet doesn't come along.\n\nEventually perhaps we'll have an alternative strategy that doesn't rely on bans, which anyway aren't really effective with large a enough botnet.
