Eventually a middle ground was chosen: remove the SSE-optimized and assembly code, but keep a simple miner as reference. Maybe this should be reconsidered, but i suppose it will require some discussion first. I'm in favor of removing myself.\n",

    "body": "If a reference implementation is the goal then IMO it should be implemented as a seperate program using the RPC \"getwork\" interface.\n\nI would argue that Jeff Garzik's RPC CPU miner (the one I mentioned before) is good enough to serve as a reference implementation. Heck the code's a lot cleaner than what's currently inside bitcoin itself.\n\nFurthermore a _good_ reference implementation would IMO contain only the bare essentials to illustrate the algorithm, and those expressed as simply as possible. Which would be something like a Python script containing only the \"getwork\" call to get work, a loop over all nonces to search for the correct one, followed by a \"getwork\" call when the target's matched.\n\nSuch an implementation however, would perform so poorly that no one would use it, and as a result it wouldn't be tested, making it likely to have bugs. Which is roughly the same for the builtin miner; i.e. only people who don't know or care what they're doing still use it.\n",
