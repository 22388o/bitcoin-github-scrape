sipa,2011-08-12T09:07:59Z,"There was a large discussion some time ago about this, split between people wanting to remove all mining code, and people who wanted to keep as much as possible. Eventually a middle ground was chosen: remove the SSE-optimized and assembly code, but keep a simple miner as reference. Maybe this should be reconsidered, but i suppose it will require some discussion first. I'm in favor of removing myse",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/466#issuecomment-1789840,1789840,
muggenhor,2011-08-12T09:38:20Z,"If a reference implementation is the goal then IMO it should be implemented as a seperate program using the RPC ""getwork"" interface.\n\nI would argue that Jeff Garzik's RPC CPU miner (the one I mentioned before) is good enough to serve as a reference implementation. Heck the code's a lot cleaner than what's currently inside bitcoin itself.\n\nFurthermore a _good_ reference implementation would IMO",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/466#issuecomment-1790016,1790016,

gavinandresen,2011-08-12T16:11:24Z,I'd be ok with a version of this patch that completely removes the mining code but adds a reference miner (in contrib/ ).  Either Jeff's or a pure-Python-no-dependencies one.\n\nAlso:  setgenerate's help text should be changed like you changed getgenerate and both methods should be marked deprecated.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/466#issuecomment-1792553,1792553,
