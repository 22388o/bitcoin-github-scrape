eklitzke,2018-03-10T15:57:18Z,"nit: Instead of move here and erase a few lines below, you can do the search one and localize the logic:\n\n```c++\nauto it = mapValue.find(""fromaccount"");\nassert(it != mapValue.end());  // optional, if you feel like it\nstrFromAccount = std::move(it->second);\nmapValue.erase(it);\n```\n\nOne day in the glorious future when we're all using C++17 you can use `.extract()`.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12658#discussion_r173625950,173625950,src/wallet/wallet.h

ryanofsky,2018-03-13T14:52:01Z,"Not being changed by this PR, but seems bad to me that length is not checked on serialization (only on deserialization).",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12658#discussion_r174160432,174160432,src/wallet/wallet.h
laanwj,2018-03-13T17:38:39Z,"Although you could add a sanity check, serialization is probably too late to check it. Ideally anything inputting account/label names should check this to be able to give an useful error and reject setting it before putting it in a data structure.\nBut yes, out of scope here.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12658#discussion_r174222081,174222081,src/wallet/wallet.h
