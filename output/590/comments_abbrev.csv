laanwj,2011-10-23T12:13:53Z,@tcatm how are we going to handle this?\nwill you close this pull request when this ends up in the bitcoin source?\nor do we consider it 'merged' already because it is in transifex?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/590#issuecomment-2495056,2495056,
tcatm,2011-10-23T12:30:07Z,I think we should move all translations to transifex where I (at least for now) will take care of merging them back here. Transifex has nice statistics and I'm going to merge the translations once they are 100% complete. I will create a page on bitcoin.org describing the process of adding new translations.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/590#issuecomment-2495112,2495112,
