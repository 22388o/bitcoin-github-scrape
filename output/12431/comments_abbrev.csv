ryanofsky,2018-03-15T15:33:12Z,"@TheBlueMatt, this is a simple, one line change fixing the `NotifyBlockTip` notification in `InvalidateBlock`.

TheBlueMatt,2018-03-15T15:41:25Z,"Without thinking about it too hard, this seems fine. I'd obviously like to move towards getting rid of uiInterface calls in validation, ala #11856, but this should likely be applied there as well.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12431#issuecomment-373421483,373421483,

jamesob,2018-02-16T16:52:55Z,"Played around with doing this, but found that the return from RPC is (unfortunately) no different in the timeout case, meaning we'd have to spin up a separate thread in-test, run a timer, and then assert that the RPC thread hadn't yet stopped execution -- probably overkill.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12431#discussion_r168810972,168810972,test/functional/rpc_blockchain.py
