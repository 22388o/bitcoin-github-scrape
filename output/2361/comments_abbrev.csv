I can post some before-and-after screenshots. (Not sure why I didn't, to be frank and honest.)\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2361#issuecomment-14883204,14883204,

laanwj,2013-03-15T06:01:02Z,"I think the problem is that ""Wallet"" has a fixed font size, whereas ""Recent Transactions"" has not. So, depending on your system font size, it may be either larger or smaller. Hardwiring it to 13 is not a general solution either. Maybe remove the font size override for wallet completely?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2361#issuecomment-14945128,14945128,
Diapolo,2013-03-15T06:40:42Z,I'm also for removing that special casing there. Perhaps it's sufficient to leave it just bold then.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2361#issuecomment-14945894,14945894,
laanwj,2013-03-15T07:42:58Z,"Fine with me too. Or maybe a relative font size that is specified in em will work, like in CSS? Ie being able to say ""I want this 1.2 times bigger than normal letters"" would be nice.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2361#issuecomment-14947096,14947096,
