I'd prefer using a limit that is actually testable, though. 16MB sounds good.\n\n> which at worst would just make things a bit slow.\n\nIt could also crash the application with an out-of-memory error, or running out of virtual memory when compiled for 32-bit.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18993#issuecomment-633960068,633960068,

tryphe,2020-05-20 03:23:51,"Suggest `std::numeric_limits<int32_t>::max()` as it's the standard for size limits.  I'm also not really sure a 2GB buffer makes sense here, but then again, what is a sane amount? Somewhere between 2^20 and 2^31 seems fine, but towards the latter seems a bit overboard.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18993#discussion_r427720035,427720035,src/qt/rpcconsole.cpp
10xcryptodev,2020-05-20 03:46:18,"thanks @tryphe changed for the standard size limit. Yes, hard question about what number should be there. \nWhat rpc command should be the largest one? Maybe importblock with a full block?\n16MB should be fine?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18993#discussion_r427724878,427724878,src/qt/rpcconsole.cpp
tryphe,2020-05-20 04:02:52,"I think it's hard to answer that. If we make it just big enough for the biggest command we can come up with, someone will come up with a bigger one. I also don't see any way someone could accidentally paste 2GB of data in the textbox, which at worst would just make things a bit slow. I opt to wait for more comments to see if anyone objects.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18993#discussion_r427728624,427728624,src/qt/rpcconsole.cpp
