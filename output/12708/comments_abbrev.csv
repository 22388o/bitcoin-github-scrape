laanwj,2018-03-22T09:11:44Z,"Concept ACK, this makes sense because the merge script `github-merge.py` (that everyone is supposed to use) will only do clean merges.\n\n- How does this affect performance of the verify script? it's already very slow, so the difference might be negligible)\n- How deep should this check be done?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12708#issuecomment-375227316,375227316,
sipa,2018-03-22T09:34:30Z,The script becomes several times slower (I didn't measure; just my impression from waiting... maybe a few minutes). Perhaps we should restrict it to just one day of commits or so?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12708#issuecomment-375233655,375233655,
