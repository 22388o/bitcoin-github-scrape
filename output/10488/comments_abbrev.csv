TheBlueMatt,2017-05-31T19:17:24Z,"I dont think we care for position-independant arguments? They're still super new and I would be highly surprised if anyone is prioritizing by priority in 0.14, where its highly unsupported and disabled by default?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10488#discussion_r119448812,119448812,src/rpc/client.cpp
jnewbery,2017-05-31T21:13:23Z,"`adjustment thereof` sounds a little tortured to me. How about `The second argument must be set to 0.0`\n\n(simpler English and specifies precisely what the argument should be set to)",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10488#discussion_r119475490,119475490,src/rpc/mining.cpp
jnewbery,2017-05-31T21:15:09Z,Suggest you add a note that the second (dummy) argument is deprecated and may be removed in a future version. Clients should change to calling this RPC with named `fee_delta` argument if possible for forward compatibility.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10488#discussion_r119475804,119475804,src/rpc/mining.cpp
