laanwj,2014-02-28T07:51:08Z,"I see no point personally for logging these details while not having debug=net. If you want to debug networking, why not add debug=net? That's what the option was created for.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3740#issuecomment-36328615,36328615,
rebroad,2014-02-28T18:39:42Z,@laanwj because currently debug=net creates a lot of superfluous information in debug.log - can we make the levels of debugging net more granular? How would you like the command line option to be designed for different levels of net debugging please? debug=net1 or debug=net2 perhaps? or perhaps debugnet=1 or debugnet=2 ?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3740#issuecomment-36380794,36380794,
laanwj,2014-03-01T09:08:45Z,That's a fair comment -- `-debug=net` is very noisy.\nI just don't agree on this solution.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3740#issuecomment-36420146,36420146,
