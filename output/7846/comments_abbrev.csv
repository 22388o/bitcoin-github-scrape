laanwj,2016-04-14T13:07:51Z,"@sipa OHH I get it now.\nSo sync.cpp keeps track of locks _after_ they are unlocked. They are simply never cleaned up. I had assumed this was only keeping track of active locks, so I didn't understand why locks would be deleted that were still held somewhere.\nBut well in that case this fixes a memory leak too!\ntACK 5eeb913\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7846#issuecomment-209934671,209934671,
