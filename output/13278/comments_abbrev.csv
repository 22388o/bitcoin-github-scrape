practicalswift,2018-05-19T08:43:44Z,"I'm trying to understand the Qt code here.\n\nIf the Qt client is supposed to be culture aware when it comes to handling of the radix point, shouldn't we let the locale machinery handle it throughout to make the radix point handling consistent?\n\n(Also, very theoretically the user could be using an exotic evil locale with a radix point other than `.` and `,` .-))",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13278#issuecomment-390390183,390390183,
GreatSock,2018-05-19T09:34:05Z,"It now works like any other place an amount is entered. So it should be consistent everywhere now.\n\nAnd even if the user is using some weird locale it'll still allow them to type a period using the period key(or even the comma key). Before it would only let them type their locale's radix point which would not result in a valid number.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13278#issuecomment-390392757,390392757,
