luke-jr,2015-12-26T07:34:07Z,Debian is at 5.3.2 - can someone test if that needs this?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7256#issuecomment-167292430,167292430,
jonasschnelli,2016-01-02T07:31:56Z,I guess the upstream bug is that one: https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-43473.\nMaybe it's to early to remove it... will test on Debian and OSX with Qt<5.5...\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7256#issuecomment-168369194,168369194,
jonasschnelli,2016-01-02T09:12:30Z,"Tested on stable debian (8.x, just downloaded and did a VM net install). I guess the bug was fixed in Qt5.4. and debian is still on 5.3.x.\nI guess we should keep the workaround another year.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7256#issuecomment-168374383,168374383,

fanquake,2016-01-02T09:16:26Z,"Yes that is the work around the bug is fixing, if it's still present the workaround can remain. Should we add a note that it's fixed in 5.4, and as such can be removed once all platforms have upgraded to it?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7256#issuecomment-168374466,168374466,
jonasschnelli,2016-01-02T09:18:04Z,Yes. And I think we should add a link to the upstream bug in the comment.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7256#issuecomment-168374539,168374539,

jonasschnelli,2016-01-02T12:42:28Z,Yes. We have discussed that on IRC and IMO it would look after we are overdoing the workaround.\nLet's just keep it and remove the WA after one or two years.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7256#discussion_r48684401,48684401,src/qt/coincontroldialog.cpp
MarcoFalke,2016-01-02T13:35:31Z,"My reasoning was that gitian uses qt5.5, so we don't need it in the official releases. People that are using qt-5.3 or qt-5.4, still have it enabled.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7256#discussion_r48684636,48684636,src/qt/coincontroldialog.cpp
