christophebiocca,2014-02-15T17:57:10Z,"Nit about the wording:\n\n> If you disable the spending of unconfirmed change, your transaction cannot be completed until your previous transactions have at least one confirmation. This also affects how your balance is computed.\n\nIsn't that a little pessimistic? I mean in practice, a wallet will have multiple outputs to use, only a few of which will be used by any single transaction.

dgenr8,2014-02-16T00:29:43Z,"This looks to be the first mention of ""change"" period.  A rational user will think it relates to change returned by recipient for amount paid over some agreed-on price, which further confuses, since no such prices are known by bitcoin-qt.\n\nThe question is what should the message say, given the abstractions user is working with?
