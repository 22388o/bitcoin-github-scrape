laanwj,2017-09-05T21:43:44Z,"Worded like this it is not clear to me what is the advantage of this, compared to re-running make in the top-level directory.\nAfter all, make detects what files are changed and only recompiles those.\nOr is this when you change a non-test compilation unit and only want to see how it affects the unit test?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11219#issuecomment-327312303,327312303,

glowang,2020-05-19T03:08:30Z,"Sounds like either the a test or a non-test file gets changed, bitcoin core (the src dir?) needs to be recompiled. Then when is `make -C src/test` relevant?
