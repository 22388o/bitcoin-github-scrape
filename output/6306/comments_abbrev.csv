dgenr8,2015-06-19T16:25:22Z,"The targeted 1-conf attack ""Double-Spending of 1-Confirmation Transactions"" described in [1] appears to be a real risk.  The vulnerability is reduced to a known level per attacker node by this bug fix.\n\nAttacker blinds both funds receiver and a small miner to a 1-conf double spend, and the block containing it (attacker must be the first to inv the block to these nodes).

petertodd,2015-06-30T02:08:08Z,It'd be good to add a demo script and unittest of the attack to this patch to make it easier to test it. The qa/rpc-tests has a mininode implementation that you could use.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6306#issuecomment-116912849,116912849,

morcos,2015-09-16T19:03:20Z,There was discussion in #4547 against following this approach because it doesn't fully solve the problem.  I think a quick fix might be ok while we're waiting for something more substantial (P2P rewrite or #4831) but I'm not convinced there is no downside to this pull.
