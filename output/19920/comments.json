    "body": "I think including a full other reference implementation is overkill.\r\n\r\nEvery byte array as input has exactly one hash, regardless of how it is split up in chucks and hashed. You can verify the \"hash everything at once\" code path using test vectors. These are usually published by the same body that standardized the function, and are picked to give good coverage. By the nature of hashing, it tends to be sufficient to test things with a random inputs for a variety of lengths, so that the padding code gets exercised - but beyond that, the actual hashed data is of little relevance, as tiny errors in the actual hashing logic _should_ mean a completely different hash anyway.\r\n\r\nAs you point out, the buffering logic is often far more error-prone, and harder to test. I think it's a useful target for fuzzing, but all you need for that is a fuzzer that takes as input a number of chunks, and then hashes them both concatenated at once, and split up as separate writes, and compares the result.",

You can be far more effective by focussing on things that aren't guaranteed by the source code, or are likely to trigger edge cases. And this isn't just your time, but also the time of people reviewing and maintaining the codebase later.\n\nFuzzing is good at finding combinations of inputs that trigger various code paths, so use it for that.\n\n",
