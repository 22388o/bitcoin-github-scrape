Diapolo,2014-09-05T11:58:51Z,This seems to be more than just using a copy?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4851#discussion_r17168637,17168637,src/univalue/univalue_write.cpp
laanwj,2014-09-05T12:01:54Z,I don't get where this idea comes from. Why would copying be cheaper than just generating spaces on the fly? Memory access is _much_ slower than (trivial) computation.\nAnd what do you think a copy does internally? (not to say the temporary generated by `substr`)\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4851#discussion_r17168729,17168729,src/univalue/univalue_write.cpp
Diapolo,2014-09-05T12:07:05Z,"Sorry wrong wording perhaps, let me try again. You are now using a reference, but what is done in this function now looks a little different. See the long space line in the diff and now just `s += ' '`?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4851#discussion_r17168880,17168880,src/univalue/univalue_write.cpp
laanwj,2014-09-05T12:35:22Z,"Oh I see what you mean now. But it seems correct: the old loop adds spaces in units of 16 and then does a substring, but there is no point in doing that in the new case which only adds as many spaces as requested.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4851#discussion_r17169816,17169816,src/univalue/univalue_write.cpp
laanwj,2014-09-05T12:38:39Z,"Looking at the std::string API there seems to be an even better way:\n\n```\nstring.append(spaces, ' ');\n```\n\nGotta test this :)\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4851#discussion_r17169934,17169934,src/univalue/univalue_write.cpp
