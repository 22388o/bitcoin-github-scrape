laanwj,2016-01-19T10:44:34Z,"IMO we should settle this code. What do we really want here?\n\nIt's been changed way too many times over recent times, I don't think this is warranted by the importance of these errors. At some point it just introduces unnecessary risk of breakage (we don't have good testing for parameter processing), review work, and forces other patches to rebase for no good reason.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7374#issuecomment-172814692,172814692,
MarcoFalke,2016-01-19T13:20:13Z,@laanwj There is no high/low fee checks for most of the args right now. Currently you can set e.g. mintxfee arbitrarily without a warning.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7374#issuecomment-172850813,172850813,
jonasschnelli,2016-01-20T12:48:33Z,"Agree with @laanwj. It's already very heavy-to-follow if you want to see the coupling between vars (const, configurable).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7374#issuecomment-173194725,173194725,
MarcoFalke,2016-01-20T14:56:47Z,Sorry for the odd diff. Now it should be clearer that it is only adding warnings in the appropriate places.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7374#issuecomment-173228010,173228010,

MarcoFalke,2016-01-19T07:45:31Z,"I don't think you can ask someone to ""translate"" a collection of characters (`-%s=<amount>: '%s'`) into a language.\n\nAlso, this seems to work with other grammar just fine:\n\n![screenshot from 2016-01-19 08-43-51](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6399679/12412671/d6519866-be88-11e5-88e6-a5199306cbaa.png)\n\nAm I missing something?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7374#discussion_r50080846,50080846,src/init.cpp

MarcoFalke,2016-01-19T13:26:30Z,"There is nothing wrong but I'd rather not expose three %s to translators, considering that the syntax in the braces does not change. Also, this is only a short note to the user that a specific arg can't be parsed, so not worth to have perfect grammar in every possible language, imo.\n\nThough, I am happy to revert, if that's wanted.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7374#discussion_r50111053,50111053,src/init.cpp
