gmaxwell,2012-05-06T05:16:26Z,I don't think we want it showing full bars when a user only has the maximum outbound connections.  Not having full bars is pretty much the only UI incentive we create for people to get their inbound connections working.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1208#issuecomment-5532946,5532946,

laanwj,2012-05-06T06:23:31Z,"The idea is OK though, as it's more general, in that when MAX_OUTBOUND_CONNECTIONS changes the icon will still be correct.\n\nBut make sure that the ""full"" icon only shows when there are _more_ than the maximum number of outbound connections.\n\nAlternative option would be to track the number of outgoing and incoming connections separately and show a special icon when there are incoming connection",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1208#issuecomment-5533517,5533517,
ghost,2012-05-06T15:24:05Z,"I was under the impression that this was only outbound connections.  Now that I have turned off my firewall, I see that I have more than 8 connections.  Maybe the tool-tip could be changed to indicate inbound and outbound connections with a hint about port forwarding if there are no inbound connections?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1208#issuecomment-5536469,5536469,
laanwj,2012-05-06T16:13:41Z,"Yes, you could also do it the other way around and show a warning when there are no inbound connections. Many torrent clients do it that way.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1208#issuecomment-5536856,5536856,
gmaxwell,2012-05-06T18:11:01Z,"I'd prefer to not bludgeon people _too much_ about inbound connections.  Basically I want to encourage people to get inbound working when its easy for them to do so, but not have them worry about it if it's hard... and I certainly don't want to deal with a bunch of tech support burden. 'zomg my inbound isn't working' \n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1208#issuecomment-5537873,5537873,
laanwj,2012-05-06T18:15:13Z,"Right, viewed like that, it's fine the way it is. It's visible but very subtle. Closing the issue.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1208#issuecomment-5537908,5537908,
