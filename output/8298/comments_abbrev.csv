MarcoFalke,2016-07-01T11:50:25Z,"I think we should do simulations to see the exact effect of this feature.\nBut apparently it is controversial enough that it should not have been\nmerged in the first place, so removal for 0.13 seems fine.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8298#issuecomment-229927488,229927488,
laanwj,2016-07-01T11:57:09Z,"Yes, apparently simulations are not clear that this was an improvement at all (see discussion in #4906). I know it's a huge burden for anyone proposing changes to coin selection, but I think it should have been proven that this is better than the status quo first before it was merged. \n\nOr maybe even that's putting the cart before the horse: there should be a list of criteria for coin-selection ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8298#issuecomment-229928583,229928583,
