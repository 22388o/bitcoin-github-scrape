petertodd,2016-06-15T04:08:34Z,"Note that most distributions already have something along those lines, e.g. on Debian-based there is a debian-tor group, and you make cookie auth work by adding users who need it to the debian-tor group. I'd reword this to just say that you need to make sure the bitcoind user is part of the Tor group.\n\nAnyone know how non-Debian distros do this?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8203#discussion_r67096943,67096943,doc/tor.md
laanwj,2016-06-16T08:48:07Z,"Yes, giving an example for Debian may help here.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8203#discussion_r67308274,67308274,doc/tor.md
laanwj,2016-06-16T08:50:09Z,"I'd reword this a bit - cookie authentication is by far the most straightforward (even automatic) if bitcoin core has access to tor's cookie file. This is the case on Windows with Tor Browser Bundle, for example. If not, then extra work is needed to set it up.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8203#discussion_r67308558,67308558,doc/tor.md
nathaniel-mahieu,2016-06-16T16:02:33Z,Added the example for Debian. Are we worried that the debian-tor group includes too many permissions outside of this one cookie permission we are interested in?  \n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8203#discussion_r67373185,67373185,doc/tor.md
nathaniel-mahieu,2016-06-16T16:03:54Z,Removed the opinion on simplicity.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8203#discussion_r67373432,67373432,doc/tor.md
petertodd,2016-06-16T17:14:47Z,"Rather than saying ""Tor automatically creates"" how about we just say ""On Debian-based systems the user running bitcoind can be added to the debian-tor group, which has the appropriate permissions."" - Debian's package management is what's automatically creating debian-tor, not Tor itself.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8203#discussion_r67385948,67385948,doc/tor.md
nathaniel-mahieu,2016-06-16T19:19:07Z,Much better wording.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8203#discussion_r67407610,67407610,doc/tor.md
