You\n can add more commits to your pull request by committing them locally and pushing\n to your fork until you have satisfied all feedback.\n \n+\n+Scripted Diffs\n+--------------\n+\n+For mechanical, search-and-replace changes, make a \"scripted diff\". Scripted diffs embed a shell script in the commit message, which exactly reproduces the changes contained in the commit. For search-and-replace operations across many files, the script is a more-compact representation of the changes. This is easier to audit for correctness than examining all the changes.\n+\n+To create a scripted diff, prefix your commit title with the text `scripted-diff: `. In the commit message body, start the script section with the line `-BEGIN VERIFY SCRIPT-` and close the script section with the line `-END VERIFY SCRIPT-`.\n+\n+Use `git grep --files-with-matches $QUERY` to restrict your scripted changes to files in version control.\n+\n+Example:\n+\n+    scripted-diff: Replace OLD with NEW\n+\n+    -BEGIN VERIFY SCRIPT-\n+    git grep --files-with-matches OLD src/*.cpp | xargs sed --in-place --regexp-extended 's/OLD/NEW/g'\n+    -END VERIFY SCRIPT-\n+\n+NOTE: the version of `sed` pre-installed on macOS does not cleanly support in-place editing. Install `GNU sed` for that.\n+\n+\n Squashing Commits\n ---------------------------\n If your pull request is accepted for merging, you may be asked by a maintainer"
