    "body": "For reviewers who think assert is \"weird\" and \"confusing\" and wouldn't \"expect it to return a value,\" I don't see what point you are making. If you saw `fun(*ASSERT(ptr))` and had to guess what it was doing, would you actually guess anything other than \"this is going to assert `ptr` is true, dereference it and pass it to `fun`? If not, what would your guess be?\r\n\r\nI like the name `ASSERT` for this macro, because c++ developers will generally know that a false assert will abort the program. If the name `ASSERT` is misleading or confusing in a specific way, something longer but more explicit like `ABORT_IF_NULL` would serve the purpose as well.\r\n\r\nAs long as this is aborting the program on failure, I think calling this `SafeDeref` or `Ensure` or hiding the `*` operation from the reader is exactly what we *don't* want here. We *don't* want a reviewer to look at this code and think that dereferencing the pointer is safe. We want a reviewer to look at this code and see that a pointer is being dereferenced, and that something bad will happen if the pointer is null, and look closely to make sure there are no code paths where it could be null. That is why it is better to keep the `*`, because reviewers will generally already do this when they see a pointer being dereferenced.\r\n\r\nI think the name `SafeDeref` is specifically bad because I'd expect a function with that name to either safely dereference the pointer or return a default constructed value. I think the name `Ensure` is specifically bad because there are other cases where `Ensure` is used in the code and it's basically harmless (throws JSON-RPC a REST exception and returns it to the client).",

    "body": "> > If you saw `fun(*ASSERT(ptr))` and had to guess what it was doing,\r\n> \r\n> Why would you ever have to guess?\r\n\r\nThanks, that's kind of my point. You don't have to guess. If you have any question, you can look at the `ASSERT` macro and see that it wraps standard `assert`. But when reading code, people make assumptions about how things work, and when the likely assumptions are wrong, it can be a problem for readability and a future source of bugs. I still don't understand why you are saying something is \"confusing\" when it doesn't appear there is any actual fact you think someone might be confused about, but it's clear you don't like the aesthetics of overloading the word \"assert\" here. This is bad, but not as bad as if you thought it caused a practical problem.\r\n\r\nRe suggestions:\r\n\r\n- ABORT_IF_NULL, BUG_IF_NULL, FATAL_IF_NULL all seem good to me\r\n- REQUIRE or REQUIRE_NOT_NULL seem reasonable to me. My first thought was that these seemed like pointless circumlocutions, trying to avoid the word \"assert\" for no reason. But maybe there is small difference in meaning since \"assert\" is something you'd say in english about a statement or fact, while \"require\" is something you could also say about an object.\r\n- IF_NULL_ASSERT doesn't seem to make logical sense, maybe it was meant to say IF_NULL_ABORT, which would be fine.\r\n\r\nAny case, I'm glad we seem to agree there's no readability\u00a0problem here. I think current PR is fine. My favorite name would probably be ASSERT, followed by one of the names that contains ABORT or FATAL, because REQUIRE doesn't sound scary enough, and doesn't make me think that world may end if the pointer is null. But Marco's the guy putting in the work here, and whatever name he likes I am happy with.",

    "body": "Another reason I like the name `Assert` is that this plays nicely with our long-term goal to have different levels of checks. See https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/4576#issuecomment-49883271 for context. It says: \"I guess we can have two levels, optional and mandatory checks.\"\r\n\r\nThe thread also mentions the danger of building with NDEBUG, which is forbidden since 9b59e3bda8c137bff885db5b1f9150346e36e076. Given that it is impossible to build with NDEBUG, no one is testing this configuration and it is effectively unsupported. However, the check is only in one place (main.cpp, or current master: validation and net_processing, or now: check.h). So certainly it is impossible to build `bitcoind` with NDEBUG. Though, I am less sure about other binaries. And certainly it is possible to (accidentally) build single modules with NDEBUG and then accidentally link them. Haven't checked if this is possible, but the potential risk seems already too high. To fix that, I could imagine a scripted-diff that changes `assert` to `Assert` and adds includes for check.h, which would abort compilation under NDEBUG.\r\n\r\nYet another reason I like `Assert` is that it could make it easier to privide a \"pimp-my-assert\" version of a plain `assert`. As an idea it could print additional information, for example:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n            tfm::format(std::cerr, \"%s:%d (%s)\\n\"                          \\\r\n                                   \"Internal bug detected: '%s'\\n\"         \\\r\n                                   \"Aborting!\\n\"                           \\\r\n                                   \"You may report this issue here: %s\\n\", \\\r\n                __FILE__, __LINE__, __func__,                              \\\r\n                (#condition),                                              \\\r\n                PACKAGE_BUGREPORT);                                        \\\r\n```\r\n\r\nExample taken from #17408.\r\n\r\nSo using the name `Assert` instead of e.g. `Require` would make the least amount of changes in the places where previously `assert` was used.\r\n\r\nUnrelated, but the discussion about `Assume` was in #16136.",

I think returning decltype(auto) would be another way to work around this once we update past c++11",
