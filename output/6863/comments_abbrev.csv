laanwj,2015-10-26T08:00:28Z,"From @gmaxwell on IRC: Personally I would have put the 0100 input in the first position, for fear that some coinbase checking code only checks the nullness of the first input. \n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6863#issuecomment-151053305,151053305,
petertodd,2015-10-26T21:27:03Z,utACK\n\nI'd test both first and second being the null. :)\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6863#issuecomment-151289590,151289590,

sipa,2015-10-28T01:48:22Z,The new test contains a much more structured transaction only. Is there a reason to delete the previous one?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6863#issuecomment-151695022,151695022,
domob1812,2015-10-28T06:44:09Z,"The previous test didn't do what it was advertised to do - it failed not because of the null txin but because of the coinbase length restriction.  This is already tested by the preceding test, so I don't see much of a point in having two tests for that.  But if you think it should stay, I can leave it in (but ""fix"" the comment for what it really tests).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6863#issuecomment-151740929,151740929,
