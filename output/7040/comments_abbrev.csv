laanwj,2015-11-19T10:02:36Z,"The reason to keep passing `--with-gui=qt5` explicitly would be to force building with the GUI. It will fail when the Qt headers are somehow misplaced. The default is `--with-gui=auto` which uses whatever Qt version works, preferring Qt5 if both are, building without GUI if none are usable.

jonasschnelli,2015-12-02T08:42:32Z,Re-ACK.
