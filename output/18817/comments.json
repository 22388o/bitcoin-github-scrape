My perspective is that a lot of people look at `src/qt/bitcoin.cpp` but only very few of them care about localization. While it may be the best place to put it technically, it feels oddly specific there. A short hint and the link to the docs would be enough to let people know what is happening. The long-form could go into the developer notes or another place in the docs IMO.",

    "body": "@MarcoFalke \r\n\r\n> Do you have one example handy where the different handling was the root cause for an issue?\r\n\r\nThere are plenty but look at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/6443: bug in Bitcoin Qt due to Qt's highly surprising \"unsolicited\" `setlocale` call on initialization. Not a bug in `bitcoind` due to the discussed difference.\r\n\r\nThe thing is that literally _all_ locale bugs when using POSIX functions have been due to this difference. If it wasn't for the `setlocale` call which Qt does as part of initialization we wouldn't have seen a single POSIX locale bug.\r\n\r\nWe could literally kill the locale dependency bug class for good in Bitcoin Core by simply following the recommendation of the Qt documentation:\r\n\r\n> _On Unix/Linux Qt is configured to use the system locale settings by default. This can cause a conflict when using POSIX functions, for instance, when converting between data types such as floats and strings, since the notation may differ between locales. To get around this problem, call the POSIX function setlocale(LC_NUMERIC,\"C\") right after initializing QApplication, QGuiApplication or QCoreApplication to reset the locale that is used for number formatting to \"C\"-locale. [https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qcoreapplication.html]_\r\n\r\n(Aside: AFAICT there is not a single place in our code base where we _want_ the POSIX functions to use a locale other than `C` when parsing or formatting numbers. (Obviously we want Qt to be localized but that is handled by QLocale.))\r\n\r\nSo, why documenting this?\r\n\r\nA new developer coming to the project doing `git grep setlocale` won't see a single place (outside of the fuzz tests) where we opt in to POSIX locale dependence.\r\n\r\nHe or she might thus incorrectly assume that we don't risk running in to POSIX locale bugs.\r\n\r\nIf this PR is merged he/she will hopefully fully understand why we run such risk despite the apparent lack of `setlocale` call in our code base.\r\n\r\n> While this difference in handling may be theoretically correct, we should never obverse it in practice.\r\n\r\nIf consensus critical code would use a POSIX locale dependent function the worst case scenario would be a chain split between `bitcoind` clients and a subset of Bitcoin Qt clients (depending on their locale). For `bitcoind` the POSIX locale is guaranteed to be `C` whereas it can be whatever funky locale the user chooses in Bitcoin Qt.\r\n\r\nSuch a worst-case chain split would certainly be observable in practice :)\r\n\r\n> If we did, it would be a bug, as any locale dependent functions should be avoided.\r\n\r\nI share the long-term goal of removing all usages of locale dependent functions, but I don't see how that would be in conflict with wanting to document how locales are _currently_ used in our project, and the risks such use entails :)\r\n\r\nShould I perhaps drop or rephrase the developer note comment?\r\n\r\nAs long as we document this _somehow_ and _somewhere_ in a greppable way in our project I'm happy :)",
