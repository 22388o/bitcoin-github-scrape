Sjors,2020-04-27 14:59:43,"utACK 2a78098\n\nThe change in `DescriptorScriptPubKeyMan` is consistent with `LegacyScriptPubKeyMan` which initialises everything.\n\nAs for `WalletDescriptor`, there's not really a pattern for classes that use `ADD_SERIALIZE_METHODS` which variables we do and don't initialise. Afaik we only use the empty `WalletDescriptor()` constructor when loading a database record. In that case everything",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18782#issuecomment-620041101,620041101,

Maybe we should just infer the type from the descriptor instead as descriptors have a `GetOutputType`. In fact, I think `m_address_type` could be eliminated entirely.
