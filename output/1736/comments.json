For all other purposes, it is not functional.\n\nFurthermore, I've recently learned that this way of implementation is not viable at all, as I2P needs longer addresses to be globally routable. The correct solution is removing it entirely from the source, and later re-add it correctly, I'm afraid. That will be for after 0.7, though.\n",
