laanwj,2018-12-18T07:47:29Z,"yea I'd say NACK on going back to 64x64 here, this makes assumptions about the size that the OS will use, and 256x256 has been more or less the default for OSX for a while. It's up to the OS to scale this image down.\n\nScaling to 256x256 likely has no effect because the input image is 256x256?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14990#discussion_r242433172,242433172,src/qt/networkstyle.cpp
