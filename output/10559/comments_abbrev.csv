morcos,2017-06-08T21:27:22Z,"I don't think it really matters much either way, we're talking about real edge cases:\n- a tx being announced to us which recently appeared in a block and has already had its output spent.   And I think we must be talking about a case where a flush happened in between the tx and it's spend otherwise the coin would have been fresh and erased and HaveCoinInCache would never have returned true anywa",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10559#issuecomment-307232349,307232349,
gmaxwell,2017-06-09T01:52:53Z,I think the semantics change should happen.  My doubt is only if AlreadyHave should be using this call; or perhaps one that will also potentially return spent entries.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10559#issuecomment-307273655,307273655,
sipa,2017-06-09T02:11:57Z,"Do you feel like changing `CCoinsViewMemPool::HaveCoin` to also check for non-spentness? I believe that function is in fact not called anywhere, so perhaps it can assert instead.

morcos,2017-06-12T15:51:15Z,"@sipa I agree it is not currently used.  I'm on the fence about changing it, but happy to if that's what everyone else wants.  I feel like the definition is a bit different anyway if it's in the mempool, since you could for instance still create a new transaction that spends that coin which would be accepted (as a replacement).",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10559#issuecomment-307831857,307831857,
