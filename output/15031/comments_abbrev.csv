gmaxwell,2018-12-24T22:00:43Z,"How will this change benefit users of the software?  The compiler will optimize out a test like this when it is actually useless,  and yet to the extent that the removal does anything it will simply make the code more brittle against any future change in the underlying type.\n\nActually looking at the code, I see that the test is actually <= 0, so this would-- in fact-- change the behaviour.

canselcik,2018-12-26T20:53:28Z,Thanks for the feedback guys. I agree it would be better making the type signed. Let me make the changes accordingly and update the PR.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15031#issuecomment-450024825,450024825,
canselcik,2018-12-26T23:14:48Z,@gmaxwell @promag Updated the PR so that the type is `ssize_t` for `maxConfirms` and `maxPeriods`.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15031#issuecomment-450039640,450039640,
promag,2018-12-31T01:14:33Z,@canselcik despite being better IMO this is an unnecessary change as there's nothing wrong with the current code.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15031#issuecomment-450599001,450599001,
