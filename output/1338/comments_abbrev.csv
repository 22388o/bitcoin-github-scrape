jgarzik,2012-05-17T22:59:13Z,"1) the txnode bit is NAK'd.  not thread safe or really 100% accurate, and the value of the information is too low compared to adding that variable\n\n2) the top, oh, 75% of this patch seems ACK-worthy, though it is changing High Value Code for a bunch of debug output, so the justification is not very large.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1338#issuecomment-5776297,5776297,
rebroad,2012-05-18T08:30:21Z,"@gmaxwell how would you code it so that it reports the peer in question for a DoS(100) event? I've been testing this for over a month and not noticed any problems. What sort of symptoms from being thread-unsafe would you expect to see?\n\nRegarding changing of HVC for additional information, does this mean that we're stuck with not being able to log this information as we don't want to touch HVC?

jgarzik,2012-08-01T15:55:58Z,"This does seem interesting, but I think we will have the TX hash logged elsewhere, if an error occurs.\n\nJust not a big driving need for this change, and it's not collecting ACKs, so closing.\n\nPS.  You added a ton of redundant braces { }\n\nThis is too big.  If you can (a) remove the redundant braces you added all over the place and (b) submitted this in smaller pieces\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1338#issuecomment-7431259,7431259,

rebroad,2012-05-21T10:26:38Z,"I would argue that given it's a log message, as long as the message can be correlated to the code, then that's all that matters. I don't see a strong argument for filling debug.log with more bytes than needed to communicate what is happening. In fact, there's an argument that it doesn't need to be human readable at all, but then that would require additional tools to translate it into something hu",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1338#discussion_r852449,852449,src/main.cpp
