jonasschnelli,2015-11-30T15:56:59Z,Updated. Remove translations for GetWarnings() entirely. Will also remove the translation of the GUI warning string in the overview page.\n\n![bildschirmfoto-2015-11-30-um-16 56 01](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/178464/11476498/5920dd4c-9783-11e5-8a04-e2412355b0a4.png)\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7134#issuecomment-160670058,160670058,
