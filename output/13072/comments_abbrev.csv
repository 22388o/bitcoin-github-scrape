sipa,2018-06-13T19:05:57Z,"@luke-jr The existing ""legacy"" address type (argument to `-addresstype` command line option) causes P2SH-multisig addresses for the multisig RPC. ""p2sh-segwit"" will cause P2SH-P2WSH-multisig addresses, and ""bech32"" will cause P2WSH-multisig.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13072#issuecomment-397051007,397051007,

instagibbs,2018-06-22T14:44:40Z,is this a bugfix?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13072#discussion_r197468486,197468486,src/outputtype.cpp
instagibbs,2018-06-22T14:47:59Z,I didn't think this rpc call changed wallet state previously?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13072#discussion_r197469629,197469629,src/rpc/misc.cpp
ajtowns,2018-06-22T15:08:13Z,It moves the `AddCScript()` call from the function invoking `AddAndGetDestinationForScript()` into `AAGDFS()`; see corresponding change in src/wallet/rpcwallet.cpp,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13072#discussion_r197475970,197475970,src/outputtype.cpp
ajtowns,2018-06-22T15:09:55Z,"This shouldn't change wallet state either -- keystore is a dummy variable that's just declared here and discarded. The functional tests don't work without wallet support compiled in, but I think I gave it a quick test by hand and it was okay.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13072#discussion_r197476681,197476681,src/rpc/misc.cpp
sipa,2018-07-06T03:45:34Z,This field becomes essentially useless for new address types. I'm not sure what to do about that.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13072#discussion_r200543080,200543080,src/rpc/misc.cpp
achow101,2018-07-09T21:41:58Z,It could be changed to `script` and have `redeemScript` behind a deprecation switch.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13072#discussion_r201156432,201156432,src/rpc/misc.cpp
