arowser,2014-06-04T00:47:22Z,"@laanwj Yes, I'll update it later, sorry for late. I'm have more than ten years experience in c lang, but I'm a c++ new guy, so I'm studying how change char \* to vector in c++ and make sure the chang is ok before I push it again, thanks (:\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4236#issuecomment-45040296,45040296,
