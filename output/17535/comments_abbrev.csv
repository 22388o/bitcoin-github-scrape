jonatack,2019-11-20 17:45:36,Could add `found = {'blockheight': 0}` if you would prefer it to fail with `AssertionError: not(0 == 103)` instead of `NameError: name 'found' is not defined`,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17535#discussion_r348653816,348653816,test/functional/wallet_listsinceblock.py

jonatack,2019-11-22 08:48:23,"I grew up being taught to not use the Oxford comma, and it could be considered less aesthetic, but it seems to have made a resurgence. It has the benefit of reducing potential confusion in writing that needs to be clear. Without it, meanings of sentences can change. So it can be a good idea to use it for documentation writing.
