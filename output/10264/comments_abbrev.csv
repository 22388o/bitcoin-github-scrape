jnewbery,2017-04-28T21:06:49Z,"nit: I wouldn't assert these two things are equal. Number of nodes is 2, and the test framework sets up two connections between each node (see `connect_nodes_bi()`). The fact that these are the same number is a coincidence.\n\nJust `assert_equal(self.nodes[0].getconnectioncount(), 2)` is better, with a comment explaining why.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10264#discussion_r114019857,114019857,test/functional/net.py
jnewbery,2017-04-28T21:07:52Z,"again, this should just assert equality to 2",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10264#discussion_r114020009,114020009,test/functional/net.py
jnewbery,2017-04-28T21:12:11Z,micro-nit: I think because of indentation these are clearer if you don't wrap them over two lines. That's just my personal preference though.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10264#discussion_r114020689,114020689,test/functional/net.py
MarcoFalke,2017-05-01T10:14:21Z,"nit: personally I'd prefer if it was on a single line, such that it shows up as a whole in case of a print traceback.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10264#discussion_r114114321,114114321,test/functional/net.py
