sipa,2014-05-29T10:29:21Z,"Not very clean that the different calls with uiInterface.ShowProgress(""Verifying blocks...""... are called from two very different places. \n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4223#discussion_r13175594,13175594,src/rpcblockchain.cpp
laanwj,2014-05-29T10:36:14Z,Right - would be  better to have this all contained to VerifyDB.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4223#discussion_r13175742,13175742,src/rpcblockchain.cpp
cozz,2014-05-29T12:59:35Z,"Yes not so clean, I did that because there are a lot of ""return"" statements in VerifyDB(..), so I would need to add a signal before every ""return"" in VerifyDB(..). I will change it.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4223#discussion_r13178912,13178912,src/rpcblockchain.cpp
laanwj,2014-05-29T13:14:41Z,"Just create a a class ""VerifyingBlocks"" and use RAII. Every return path will hit the destructor, so do the signal there.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4223#discussion_r13179444,13179444,src/rpcblockchain.cpp
laanwj,2014-05-29T15:13:31Z,"I'd prefer moving all the implementation to main.cpp, instead of specifying it in the header. This also avoids having to make main.h depend on ui_interface.h\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4223#discussion_r13185585,13185585,src/main.h
sipa,2014-05-29T15:30:55Z,Agree.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4223#discussion_r13186604,13186604,src/main.h
brandondahler,2014-05-30T03:41:05Z,Nit: Why use Init() and Finialize() instead of CVerifyDB() and ~CVerifyDB()?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4223#discussion_r13215610,13215610,src/main.cpp
laanwj,2014-05-30T06:30:29Z,Agree with @brandondahler here. Those methods are redundant.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4223#discussion_r13218102,13218102,src/main.cpp
laanwj,2014-06-02T14:24:16Z,Displaying a dialog box in the model code is a bit questionable - that's supposed to happen in some view - the model should only pass on or process signals from the core.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4223#discussion_r13286569,13286569,src/qt/clientmodel.cpp
Diapolo,2014-06-02T15:54:13Z,I remember I got that feedback too once :). And I remember I decided you were right.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4223#discussion_r13291668,13291668,src/qt/clientmodel.cpp
