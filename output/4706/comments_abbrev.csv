laanwj,2014-08-18T07:42:53Z,"Looks good to me, although before merging it must be verified that we're not passing in numbers that are potentially negative anywhere. After this change that would result in an integer overflow or undefined behavior.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4706#issuecomment-52460914,52460914,
kdomanski,2014-08-18T18:19:31Z,"@laanwj I took a look and it seems that these methods are only ever used by various **Serialize/Unserialize** functions and methods. In some of them, the size parameter is acquired through **sizeof** operator. In other, the size is calculated in a trivial manner, or at least trivial anough to warrant usage of **size_t** in every other streamlike object's **T.write(..)** or **T.read(..)**  method.\",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4706#issuecomment-52532908,52532908,
laanwj,2014-08-18T18:42:25Z,"Ok thanks for checking.\n\nI'd prefer not use anything with virtual methods, though. Serialization is performance-critical, and having vtables (which are essentially function pointers) are known to make it easier to write exploits so may be worse from a security viewpoint.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4706#issuecomment-52536186,52536186,
sipa,2014-08-18T18:46:54Z,"Yes, I really want to avoid introducing runtime lookups for serialization. The effective amount of code is huge, and it only really works so well because the compiler can optimize pretty much everything away.\n\nOf course, I haven't benchmarked, and numbers may convince me otherwise.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4706#issuecomment-52536808,52536808,
