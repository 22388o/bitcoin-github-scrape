paveljanik,2017-04-19T14:21:44Z,Why this change?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10229#discussion_r112215832,112215832,test/functional/blockchain.py
paveljanik,2017-04-19T14:27:08Z,Mention the `getdifficulty` RPC test in the top level comment or remove the list of tested methods there.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10229#discussion_r112217390,112217390,test/functional/blockchain.py
paveljanik,2017-04-19T14:42:03Z,Can you move the def after the `_test_getblockheader` so it is ordered the same as it is called?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10229#discussion_r112221609,112221609,test/functional/blockchain.py

jimmysong,2017-04-19T14:54:37Z,flake8 warning: `E501 line too long (85 > 79 characters)`,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10229#discussion_r112225214,112225214,test/functional/blockchain.py
jimmysong,2017-04-19T14:54:47Z,Is there a cleverer way to do this?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10229#discussion_r112225255,112225255,test/functional/blockchain.py
jnewbery,2017-04-19T21:39:24Z,"Might as well fix this docstring while you're at it. The following RPCs are also tested:\n\n- getbestblockhash\n- getblockhash\n- getblockheader",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10229#discussion_r112320502,112320502,test/functional/blockchain.py
jnewbery,2017-04-19T21:40:32Z,"My personal preference is to ignore the 'line too long' warning. Nothing wrong with going over 79 character lines in my opinion (but we don't have a style guide for functional tests, so entirely up to you)",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10229#discussion_r112320744,112320744,test/functional/blockchain.py
jnewbery,2017-04-19T21:41:21Z,"I'd prefer a more descriptive name than `res`, perhaps `difficulty`? (or even combine with the line below)",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10229#discussion_r112320923,112320923,test/functional/blockchain.py
jimmysong,2017-04-19T21:52:10Z,good idea.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10229#discussion_r112322921,112322921,test/functional/blockchain.py
jimmysong,2017-04-19T21:53:22Z,Makes sense.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10229#discussion_r112323146,112323146,test/functional/blockchain.py
