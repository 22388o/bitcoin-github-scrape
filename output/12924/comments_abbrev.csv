MarcoFalke,2018-04-17T20:02:54Z,"E.g. here it seems that you are removing `hdmasterkeyid` from the dict. To make it easier for people that rely on this key to upgrade/downgrade without having to change their code (or configuration) every time they switch, it could make sense to leave the `ret.pushKV(""hdmasterkeyid"", meta->hdMasterKeyID.GetHex());` in for now. (Can be removed in the next release, for example)",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12924#discussion_r182207957,182207957,src/wallet/rpcwallet.cpp
jnewbery,2018-04-17T21:01:54Z,"Ah, I see. And also have `hdseedid` return the same value? Yes, I can do that.\n\nI can also hide `hdmasterkeyid` behind a deprecation switch if you think that's useful.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12924#discussion_r182232508,182232508,src/wallet/rpcwallet.cpp
MarcoFalke,2018-04-17T21:11:29Z,Not sure if we need the overkill of a deprecation switch for every tiny api change. Just returning both and mentioning that one of the is deprecated in the docs seems pragmatic.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12924#discussion_r182235105,182235105,src/wallet/rpcwallet.cpp
jnewbery,2018-04-17T21:35:29Z,"Sounds good. I'll just return both and mention in the release notes\n\nThe deprecation switch isn't too heavy, so if anyone thinks it's necessary I can add it.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12924#discussion_r182241251,182241251,src/wallet/rpcwallet.cpp
