jtimon,2015-07-05T01:55:27Z,I know this will be more interesting after #6051 and #6335 but why keep waiting?\nThis is good already.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5697#issuecomment-118570178,118570178,

jgarzik,2015-07-06T23:50:26Z,concept ACK - however this sort of PR needs constant rebasing.  Usually better to break it up into even smaller chunks than modifying 40+ files in one go.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5697#issuecomment-119029826,119029826,
jtimon,2015-07-07T07:43:48Z,"Yes, that's why I try to avoid making these cleanups after the code moves that make them possible and not at the same time (so that the moves are less painful). But they keep accumulating...\nThe need for constant rebases and lack of review is why I closed it last time, and When I get bored of I will likely close it once again. \nBut, yes, smaller pieces (maybe small enough to get into the trivial",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5697#issuecomment-119106486,119106486,
Diapolo,2015-07-07T07:50:47Z,"I always think this is a valuable work, but doesn't get much review time or seems to trivial for getting reviewed. Perhaps the trivial branch is the better place, but IMHO the trivial cycles should be shorter also.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5697#issuecomment-119108398,119108398,

jtimon,2015-07-23T19:13:06Z,"Sorry, I didn't realized this needed a trivial rebase (a `using namespace std` near a newly added `#include <boost/foreach.hpp>` in walletmodel.cpp).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5697#issuecomment-124214828,124214828,
laanwj,2015-07-27T12:42:30Z,ACK - but let's do this only once per major release\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5697#issuecomment-125192156,125192156,
jtimon,2015-07-28T10:36:55Z,Limiting to at most one big include cleanup per major release sounds reasonable.\nI'm not sure I will ever do another one as big as this one though (and smaller ones can be made part of the relevant PR or via the trivial branch).\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5697#issuecomment-125549978,125549978,
