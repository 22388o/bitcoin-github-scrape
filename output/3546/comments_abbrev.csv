Michagogo,2014-01-15T21:34:19Z,"@laanwj It's just a matter of consistency... I guess either way is fine, but my decision to use .zip instead of .tar.gz was simply ""which one requires fewer changes"", since there are several .zips and only one .tar.gz. If you want, I can go and switch them all... (and hopefully not mess up the tar syntax, since I'm not too familiar with that, but I can probably imitate linux deps.)\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3546#issuecomment-32417526,32417526,
