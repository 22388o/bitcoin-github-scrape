gwillen,2020-10-29 19:55:59,"Hmm, that's a good question. Mostly I don't quite know how to do that. I see that `make check` runs the following things:\n\n`make -C src/ check-TESTS` (which I definitely want)\n`test/util/bitcoin-util-test.py` (which I maybe don't actually want, but it only takes a couple seconds)\n`test/util/rpcauth-test.py` (which I don't actually know what it tests, but it runs instantly)\n`bench/bench_b",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20264#issuecomment-718985564,718985564,

gwillen,2020-10-29 20:01:24,"Yeah, I had previously (before today) mostly thought of `make check` as just running the stuff that's actually `make -C src/ check-TESTS`. I didn't know about some of the other stuff.\n\nI think it makes sense for `make check` to mostly run stuff that's fast and/or really important, and the functional tests to be slower and more thorough.

gwillen,2020-10-29 20:04:55,"Ok for what it's worth, I'm convinced by @luke-jr 's point that I would be better off having my script just directly run the parts of `make check` that I want.

If you're trying to save resources I'd also suggest just disabling targets like the benchmarks (`--disable-bench`) if you aren't interested in compiling / running them.
