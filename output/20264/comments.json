    "body": "Hmm, that's a good question. Mostly I don't quite know how to do that. I see that `make check` runs the following things:\r\n\r\n`make -C src/ check-TESTS` (which I definitely want)\r\n`test/util/bitcoin-util-test.py` (which I maybe don't actually want, but it only takes a couple seconds)\r\n`test/util/rpcauth-test.py` (which I don't actually know what it tests, but it runs instantly)\r\n`bench/bench_bitcoin` (which I probably want, I think)\r\n`make -C src/secp256k1/ check` (which I don't want)\r\n`make -C src/univalue/ check` (which is probably irrelevant but also runs instantly)\r\n\r\nSo it might be that `make -C src/ check-TESTS` would actually do what I want.
