gmaxwell,2015-03-29T00:42:09Z,"@dgenr8 I think it was never the plan to leave it that way forever... In any case, the more complete and correct way to handle that is to change the conflict logic from checking if the txn is in the mempool already to checking if the it would be accepted into the mempool if it were tried; but thats a fair bit of work for what is otherwise a small feature, so it's not great to have to do it first.\",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5951#issuecomment-87335305,87335305,
