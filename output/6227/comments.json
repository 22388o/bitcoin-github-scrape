    "body": "@diapolo But why? This patch introduces an ever-small amount of risk at no gain at all. Boost's foreach works just as well as Qt's, and at least the code is verified to work that way.\n\nI understand it is your free time too, and I'm sorry for that, but that is no argument to merge everything. Mind that this is a highly critical piece of software. We can't just merge things for the sake of being a lot of work.\n\n> it's not very motivating at all to just hear that same phrase again\n\nI'm only repeating that because you don't pay attention to it. Please try to contribute changes that fix reported issues, not just 'because I think the code is prettier this way'.\n",
