jonasschnelli,2015-06-03T12:58:39Z,Codereview utACK.\nNext time it would recommend to split of the `const` changes and brackets/line break changes into a different commit.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6227#issuecomment-108391384,108391384,
Diapolo,2015-06-03T13:05:48Z,@jonasschnelli I just wanted to ensure I'm using the correct style that get's applied after clang-cleanup and changed it in the same commit. I hope this is still okay for this pull :). Thanks for review.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6227#issuecomment-108395951,108395951,

Diapolo,2015-07-03T05:20:43Z,"@laanwj May I remember you that you were it, who tagged this ""improvement"". Also it's not my fault that time of the core devs is limited. It's also my free time, I use to create patches for Bitcoin Core and it's not very motivating at all to just hear that same phrase again. You even reviewed this and @jonasschnelli gave an ACK... why is the discussion always longer than just merging it?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6227#issuecomment-118238223,118238223,

laanwj,2015-07-03T07:25:58Z,"@diapolo But why? This patch introduces an ever-small amount of risk at no gain at all. Boost's foreach works just as well as Qt's, and at least the code is verified to work that way.\n\nI understand it is your free time too, and I'm sorry for that, but that is no argument to merge everything.
