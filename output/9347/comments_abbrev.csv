MarcoFalke,2016-12-14T22:20:00Z,"Not sure if I solved this merge conflict correctly. `fLimitFree` should probably be `true` to backport the behavior how it is in master, otoh the other places in wallet.cpp don't apply the limit, so it should not be applied here for consistency either?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9347#discussion_r92503011,92503011,src/wallet/wallet.cpp
morcos,2016-12-15T19:55:25Z,"My view point is this doesn't matter.  I think its fine the way you did it, and more consistent with the rest of 0.13 code.  But I also think it would be no big deal if it was rate limited.  It happens every 20 mins anyway..

gmaxwell,2016-12-15T23:18:51Z,"I believe this should be false like in the other cases of the wallet behavior. The ""free limiter"" this this flag controls there is really a p2p network feature, and shouldn't really apply to wallet transactions... and in 0.13.2 we won't have removed the relaying of non-fee transactions yet.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9347#discussion_r92722012,92722012,src/wallet/wallet.cpp
