TheBlueMatt,2017-03-10T17:52:49Z,"Looks good, though I'd prefer if we narrow the catch and change TINYFORMAT_ERROR to throw a more narrow exception type. Not for any specific concern, but...man I hate C++ exceptions.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9963#issuecomment-285737918,285737918,
laanwj,2017-03-10T18:20:21Z,So are there any errors during log message formatting that raise `runtime_error` that you'd want to escalate? We don't have any sensible/specific exception handling so personally I'd prefer to keep it like this.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9963#issuecomment-285744895,285744895,
