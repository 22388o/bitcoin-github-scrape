theStack,2021-11-11 18:34:37,"nit, since we are already in global namespace, the scope-resolution operator could be dropped (like in `AddrmanToStream` above):\n```suggestion\n    s << Params().MessageStart();\n```",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23477#discussion_r747730936,747730936,src/test/addrman_tests.cpp
jnewbery,2021-11-12 09:11:26,oops. I'll be more consistent with these comments in future.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23477#discussion_r748088873,748088873,src/test/addrman_tests.cpp
jnewbery,2021-11-12 09:13:26,"I'm not sure, but I think there's a preference to be more explicit when we're calling global functions like this.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23477#discussion_r748090166,748090166,src/test/addrman_tests.cpp
MarcoFalke,2021-11-12 10:40:08,"I think `/*deterministic=*/true` is the ""clang-format-correct"" formatting.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23477#discussion_r748148523,748148523,src/test/addrman_tests.cpp
theStack,2021-11-12 12:36:46,"Okay, my assumption was that the scope-resolution operator is only preferred if there is the possibility of namespace ambiguity (e.g. in class methods). I guess it should then also be added to `Params()` in `AddrmanToStream` to be consistent. Again, not a big deal, but maybe something to include in potential follow-up PRs.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23477#discussion_r748254648,748254648,src/test/addrman_tests.cpp
jnewbery,2021-11-12 12:40:47,Thanks Marco. That was my understanding too. I should have also formatted `consistency_check_ratio` in that way.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23477#discussion_r748256946,748256946,src/test/addrman_tests.cpp
