laanwj,2015-01-16T08:50:04Z,"The logic here is too complicated for it's own sake, but I think you're wrong here. 0 threads means 0 threads. No ""script verification threads"" are created.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5673#discussion_r23068561,23068561,src/init.cpp
Diapolo,2015-01-16T09:15:07Z,"Damn right, my initial thoughts were that they HAVE to be checked anyway, so 0 threads makes no sense. But without threads just means we do it directly in the function and not in separate threads right?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5673#discussion_r23069496,23069496,src/init.cpp
Diapolo,2015-01-16T09:27:52Z,"@laanwj I know it's minor, but reworked it to be more clear. You are free to accept this pull or just want to close it.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5673#discussion_r23069977,23069977,src/init.cpp
laanwj,2015-01-16T09:32:41Z,"Yes, ""0 threads"" means that verification is done in the caller thread. But I don't think it's worth changing this code for, sorry. We're already overworked, let's try to keep down on the number of unnecessary changes.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5673#discussion_r23070178,23070178,src/init.cpp
