jgarzik,2012-05-24T17:10:22Z,"ACK\n\nTangentially related:  it would be nice to move as much code from init.cpp into net*.cpp as possible, with init.cpp only calling NetParseConfig() or somesuch.  Maybe that would help with qt/optionsmodel.cpp long term maintenance.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1389#issuecomment-5911976,5911976,

laanwj,2012-06-01T10:32:31Z,"ACK on gui changes\n\nI wonder if ""applyproxysettings"" belongs in optionsmodel, though (or the ui\ncode at all).

sipa,2012-06-01T10:37:35Z,"Yes, and it is effectively duplicated code from init.cpp for now. That's why Jeff already suggested a common NetParseConfig somehwere - I think that's the right approach.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1389#issuecomment-6057733,6057733,

Diapolo,2012-06-04T20:58:45Z,"@sipa This introduces a small display bug in the Qt GUI, it displays ""localhost"" as default Proxy-IP and it seems hostnames are not allowed there. If I enable the proxy and click apply it is changed to 127.0.0.1.\n\nI think this happens in CNetAddr::ToStringIP(), which resolves 127.0.0.1 to ""localhost"", which is true, but currently not allowed in the GUI input field or in this line: https://github",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1389#issuecomment-6110843,6110843,

sipa,2012-05-26T17:52:42Z,"Internally, proxies can be selected separately for each network, and for hostname-based destination. The config and GUI right now are pinned to assume the IPv4 one is the only one, so they read NET_IPV4, and modify the NET_IPV4, NET_IPV6, and named ones simuitaneously.\n\nIt's just a temporary measure, I expect the GUI config panel will be extended with more proxy options, and for RPC maybe we can",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1389#discussion_r885808,885808,src/bitcoinrpc.cpp
