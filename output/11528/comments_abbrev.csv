sipsorcery,2017-10-20T11:13:36Z,Closing this PR as the code changes either need some more work or need to go into the leveldb repo.

sipsorcery,2017-10-20T11:26:46Z,"@laanwj Don't worry I've got thicker skin than that :).\n\nClosed this PR because as you mentioned a 3rd of the changes need to go to the leveldb repo. Another couple need some more work as they broke the Linux build. I'll resubmit when I've been able to sort those issues out.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11528#issuecomment-338180331,338180331,
