    "body": "The rationale for removing the predecessor was that (maybe) people\nwere confused which clang format script is meant for day-to-day dev\nactivity, so they used none. Lets hope this changes after we had the\ndiscussion in last weeks meeting and after deleting the unused script.\nSo there is only one script left with a description on how to use it.\nThough, I am not interested in enforcing the use of clang format, also\nI won't highlight any style nits in pulls, as I think it would be\ndistracting.\n\nIn regard to this pull, I think this is better placed in some meta\nrepository, so we can use it whenever appropriate but don't confuse\nregular developers by the number of scripts we put in the devtools\nsubdir.\n\nI submitted a pull request to the maintainers repo to archive the old\nversion: https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-maintainer-tools/pull/7\nI think your script does fit really well into that repo as well.\n",

    "body": "I support keeping `devtools/` uncluttered for things that are clearly needed to be understood by everyone, so I am on board with it not going there at present time.\r\n\r\nIn the long run, my hope would be that every code-changing PR gets massaged developer-side prior to submission and everyone does a clean TravisCI run on the branch in their forked repo prior to submitting the PR. An efficient workflow to cut down on TravisCI round trips would also include running a pass of the same scripts on individual work machines, so having them easily available is a plus. To me, that is more of a 'developer' task rather than a 'maintainer' task - albeit an optional one at present.\r\n\r\nThe next task I am looking at is to bring the four scripts I have written into one subdirectory modeled after the rpc tests in `qa/`. I wish to consolidate the repeated code and make better OO abstractions for future extensions. Also, for the same PR, I hope to have it all working inside TravisCI in a report-information-only capacity. At that time we could decide to make it live in a different repo if it isn't too much trouble importing it for TravisCI runs on `bitcoin/bitcoin`.",
