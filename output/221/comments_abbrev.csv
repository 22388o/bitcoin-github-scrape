TheBlueMatt,2011-05-13T23:17:54Z,"Hmmm...I think pulling this would cause even more complaints, as using a non-default port means no incoming connections (probably a 1 connection per a.b.x.y thing considering I would be running 2 nodes) and (in almost all of my testing) reduced outgoing ones (ie no outgoing connections, but this probably needs more testing).  And, IMHO, the non-default port time-delay stuff is necessary until ther",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/221#issuecomment-1157998,1157998,

sipa,2011-05-15T14:14:34Z,gavin: my dnslookup patch changed the port argument of CAddress to always take a host-ordered number. Your line 1556 still calls CAddress with a network-ordered port number.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/221#issuecomment-1166078,1166078,
