    "body": "Hmmm...I think pulling this would cause even more complaints, as using a non-default port means no incoming connections (probably a 1 connection per a.b.x.y thing considering I would be running 2 nodes) and (in almost all of my testing) reduced outgoing ones (ie no outgoing connections, but this probably needs more testing).  And, IMHO, the non-default port time-delay stuff is necessary until there is more discussion on the topic.\n\nAs a side note, this does not appear to apply cleanly to current master (because of sipa's mentioned htons() stuff).\n",
