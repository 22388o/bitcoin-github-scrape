In #17627 we had a long discussion about intentionally uninitialized variables in the RNG code. Although this is a different variable, I assume we also don't want to initialise it. Keeping the warning around until the end of time seems annoying (though not deal-breaking), and will likely lead to PRs every few months of people trying to fix it. A source code comment `//  intentionally uninitialized, see #17627 and #17895` could help, but isn't there a macro to suppress it?",

    "body": "Concept ACK\r\n\r\nHowever I cannot sleep well when warnings have been printed on my screen. Once you allow one warning, this opens the door to others and eventually it becomes very difficult to close the door (clean all of them). It is easier to just never open the door (don't allow any warnings in the first place). For example, in this particular case if a warning is printed, then it is not possible to compile with full `-Werror` anymore. Also, if an \"uninitialized read\" warning is introduced in new code the chances are it will go unnoticed because, even though it is printed it will be buried somewhere in build output and CI logs.\r\n\r\nSo, I would suggest to introduce `-Wconditional-uninitialized` _and_ fix the warnings in the code:\r\n\r\n* the `random.cpp` one - given that `r1` [would be overwritten with zeroes](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/17313#issuecomment-594140834) even on `rdrand` failure, it means that if we initialize it to 0, then that will be a non-functional change.\r\n\r\n* the leveldb one - fix it and add a reference to the upstream pull request. Even if the local fix gets wiped on the next \"import\", it is not a big deal - one warning will pop up (if not already fixed upstream).\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Here is a patch to fix the warnings</summary>\r\n\r\n```diff\r\ndiff --git i/src/leveldb/db/version_set.cc w/src/leveldb/db/version_set.cc\r\nindex cd07346ea..d1845d7e4 100644\r\n--- i/src/leveldb/db/version_set.cc\r\n+++ w/src/leveldb/db/version_set.cc\r\n@@ -991,13 +991,13 @@ bool VersionSet::ReuseManifest(const std::string& dscname,\r\n                                const std::string& dscbase) {\r\n   if (!options_->reuse_logs) {\r\n     return false;\r\n   }\r\n   FileType manifest_type;\r\n   uint64_t manifest_number;\r\n-  uint64_t manifest_size;\r\n+  uint64_t manifest_size = 0; // https://github.com/google/leveldb/pull/774\r\n   if (!ParseFileName(dscbase, &manifest_number, &manifest_type) ||\r\n       manifest_type != kDescriptorFile ||\r\n       !env_->GetFileSize(dscname, &manifest_size).ok() ||\r\n       // Make new compacted MANIFEST if old one is too big\r\n       manifest_size >= TargetFileSize(options_)) {\r\n     return false;\r\ndiff --git i/src/random.cpp w/src/random.cpp\r\nindex 765239e1f..50d06d513 100644\r\n--- i/src/random.cpp\r\n+++ w/src/random.cpp\r\n@@ -113,25 +113,25 @@ static void ReportHardwareRand()\r\n  */\r\n static uint64_t GetRdRand() noexcept\r\n {\r\n     // RdRand may very rarely fail.
