It, however, dies sometimes and fails to test properly.

Perhaps some people are - I don't know.\n\nAs this is one way through which ""no key reuse"" was encouraged, I'm sort-of sad to see this go, though it's unlikely to be a big deal, as the default key isn't shown anywhere.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3074#issuecomment-26226274,26226274,
laanwj,2013-10-14T10:27:25Z,It wasn't a good feature against key reuse. \n- There are concurrency problems waiting for anyone relying on this in larger sites (that means -- anyone waiting for more than one transaction at a time)\n- As this is only active in bitcoind and there is no way to interact with the default key at all\n\nI doubt anyone is depending on this.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3074#issuecomment-26246977,26246977,
