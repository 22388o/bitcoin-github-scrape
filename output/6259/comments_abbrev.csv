jonasschnelli,2015-06-09T09:20:32Z,Not against this.\n\nBut a pure disconnect won't prevent from a reconnect of the just kicked node.\n\nI think the setban rpc command (#6158) would suit better for a node kick (kick and ban for 1h).\n\nFor this PR two things would be cool:\n- ban disconnected nodes for 1h (or at least 10mins)\n- allow removing nodes by IP without port (kick all nodes from the given IP)\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6259#issuecomment-110287508,110287508,

laanwj,2015-06-11T08:42:45Z,"@franko-org That would be possible, but e.g. with `help` it's handier to see what is available in one glance. I don't see an advantage to be particlularly thrifty with adding RPC calls. This gave us peculiar constructs like `addnode remove` in the first place :)\n\nIn retrospect, the RPC mechanism would have benefitted from namespacing (node.X, wallet.X etc) but doing that for one call is inconsis",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6259#issuecomment-111043601,111043601,
