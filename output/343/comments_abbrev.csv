gavinandresen,2011-06-24T19:00:07Z,"I believe this would open up a denial-of-service attack.\n\nThe problem is that sending ANY response over an SSL connection starts the SSL handshake. So the attack scenario is:\n\nAttacker connects to your node (and they're not from -rpcallowip address).\nYou're running -ssl=1, so start ssl handshake to return 403 response.\nAttacker doesn't respond... your rpc process must wait -rpctimeout second",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/343#issuecomment-1434447,1434447,
muggenhor,2011-06-24T19:51:00Z,"Right, so what about only sending back a 403 when _not_ using SSL? I'm pretty sure the TCP send window on most OSes these days is enough to fit those few bytes.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/343#issuecomment-1434727,1434727,
muggenhor,2011-06-24T20:04:52Z,"As for waiting for the timeout, the network portion of the RPC code could easily enough be rewritten to use asynchronous I/O (by means of Boost.Asio's async_\* functions and io_service.(?:poll|run)(?:_one)?).\n\nI was thinking of doing that anyway, as it would allow for easier IPv6 integration (i.e. only at setup time).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/343#issuecomment-1434816,1434816,
