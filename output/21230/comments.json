Thus, the condition shouldn't be hit when less than 288 blocks (from the tip) are synced. (250 is less than 288)\r\n\r\nThis is a race condition because a node that \"immediately\" requests the block that has been announced to it won't request a block that is 288 blocks \"old\". Thus it won't hit the disconnect.",
