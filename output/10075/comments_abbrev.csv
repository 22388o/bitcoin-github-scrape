laanwj,2017-03-25T10:24:34Z,"Huh, it's a mistake that this is unused; the auth cookie is supposed to be removed on shutdown.\n\nApparently I mistakenly removed the call from `StopRPC` in #5677/40b556d3742a1f65d67e2d4c760d0b13fe8be5b7.

laanwj,2017-03-25T10:43:41Z,"Not 100% sure about this one. We don't use it, and haven't used it for a long time. From what I see it was introduced in eed1785f701be93ac2464e854c2a7de1f748ef84 (pull# unknown) and never used. Would deleting wallets be something we'd ever support? (e.g. as part of multiwallet).
