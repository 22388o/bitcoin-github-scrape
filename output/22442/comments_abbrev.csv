rajarshimaitra,2021-07-19 11:59:31,"To me it seems like the new message isn't explaining the failure reason clearly.\n\nMaybe a ""Checksum for given version doesn't exist"" or something like that could help more?

theStack,2021-07-19 20:06:00,"I think this could be simplified to a one-liner (maybe it could directly be used above then instead of introducing an extra function):\n```suggestion\n    return ""bitcoin-"" + version in SHA256_SUMS.values()\n```",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22442#discussion_r672594219,672594219,test/get_previous_releases.py

theStack,2021-07-19 20:34:03,"Looking a second time at it, that was too simple-thought; it should be more like\n```\n    return any(""bitcoin-"" + version in str for str in SHA256_SUMS.values())\n```",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22442#discussion_r672611821,672611821,test/get_previous_releases.py
NelsonGaldeman,2021-07-20 08:18:58,I purposely avoided passing the full name in case the naming convention changes it will still work. Thinking more about it would be helpful to check the full name as it will throw the checksum doesn't exist if we are missing a specific OS/arch on the list even if we included some for that same version.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22442#discussion_r672909729,672909729,test/get_previous_releases.py
