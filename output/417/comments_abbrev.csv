Maybe this should also be added in the UI (Generated with: _address_).\n\nRemoving the return in wallet.cpp is harmless, but it has nothing to do with this issue.\nBetter to remove it in order to prevent merge conflicts.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/417#issuecomment-1576649,1576649,
cdhowie,2011-07-15T03:58:21Z,"It is required to remove the return statement.  If the rest of the function does not execute, `listReceived` won't be filled with any data, and therefore the receiving address will not be available to `ListTransactions`.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/417#issuecomment-1577469,1577469,

I misread the diff.\n\nBut there is a problem with that, because when `listReceived` is filled the transaction will appear twice: once with category ""generated"" and once with category ""received"".\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/417#issuecomment-1579357,1579357,

sgimenez,2011-07-16T00:13:48Z,"In fact, generated amounts could be handled internally exactly like received amounts. Then, It would be trivial to associate them with their respective addresses and accounts in the listing (reusing existing code). In particular, this would also allow us to deal with non-standard (multiple address) generations properly.\n\nI came up with a8e6510042f2f7f951414c7da124668b30da4acd.
