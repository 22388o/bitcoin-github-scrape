Then, It would be trivial to associate them with their respective addresses and accounts in the listing (reusing existing code). In particular, this would also allow us to deal with non-standard (multiple address) generations properly.\n\nI came up with a8e6510042f2f7f951414c7da124668b30da4acd. Interestingly, this is both a code simplification and a fix for a lacking feature (almost bug).\nI think the \"few people\" you mentioned would happy with such a change, would they?\n",
