    "body": "Tested ACK 891b0ee. Thanks for adding all the clarifications and `scriptpubkeyman_tests`.\r\n\r\nSo IIUC the reason we didn't see addresses added with `addmultisigaddress` in older wallets, is that `AddAndGetMultisigDestination` calls `AddAndGetDestinationForScript` which in turn called `AddCScript` on the multisig p2sh script, but _not the public keys and private keys_. Without those keys it's considered `ISMINE_NO`. When `CanProvide` looks at the P2SH address, it calls `IsMine` which calls `IsMineInner` with `recurse_scripthash = true`. Starting at the TOP level `IsMineInner` it identifies the address as `TX_SCRIPTHASH`. It would then try to find the script and run it through `IsMineInner` at the `IsMineSigVersion::P2SH` level. There it would be recognised as a `TX_MULTISIG`, which requires _all_ (private) keys, but we have none (or maybe one in a more realistic wallet).\r\n\r\nI'm still not entirely clear what the workaround in 4a7e43e8460127a40a7895519587399feff3b682 did other than \"pass the tests\", but it clearly doesn't solve the above, since it still doesn't add (private) keys.\r\n\r\nIn this PR `CanProvide` uses `recurse_scripthash = false` in `IsMineInner`, and we modified that to consider a `TX_SCRIPTHASH` or `TX_WITNESS_V0_SCRIPTHASH` to be `SPENDABLE`.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the RPC uses `pwallet->IsMine(dest)` which uses the original \"need all keys\" behaviour under `recurse_scripthash = true`. So we slightly expand what's covered by `CanProvide` without adding stuff to the wallet.\r\n\r\n@sipa does this many any sense?",
