    "body": "Very nice! Strong concept ACK, but obviously we can't use this until all features we need are supported. But it's great to see that linking finally works!\r\n\r\nFor a little extra context beyond what @fanquake said above, the macOS clang+cctools build has always been a wonky outlier because we have to build our own (very unsupported) toolchain first. LD64 is apple's libre/open-source linker, and there is a community project that maintains a [build environment for cross builds](https://github.com/tpoechtrager/cctools-port).\r\n\r\nFor a few years, there has been slow development on a darwin functionality for llvm's lld, but it's only really picked up speed and become usable in the last year or two. This PR would bring our Apple builds much more inline with others in that it would finally be using a supported libre/open-source compiler/linker combo.\r\n\r\n@fanquake Is cctools still needed at all? LLVM ships bitcode equivalents of most binutils tools (ar, nm, ranlib, etc), I wonder if we can use those instead. Maybe they require lto?",

Made some additional changes, such as renaming the `native_cctools` package to `native_llvm`, and removed some now-redundant info from the macdeploy documentation.\r\n\r\nNote: I'm pretty sure the use of `ZERO_AR_DATE` can now be dropped entirely, but have left that out for now.",
