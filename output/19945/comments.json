Then you can have your master branch follow the master of each repo and set up topic branches off master.\r\n\r\n> While making the changes I realized it requires manually doing it carefully.

I don't think this will be merged without a scripted-diff but someone more experienced can correct me if I am wrong.\r\n\r\n> I will keep the things in mind while submitting a PR in future, let me know if this needs changes/closure or can be merged.\r\n\r\nAs I said I don't think this will be merged as is. You'd need to close this PR to open a new PR from a topic branch and provide a scripted-diff. If you need help with the latter please say. \r\n",
