I've subsequently gone around and caused several parties (like electrum) to update their behavior.\n\nThis could also be coupled with a change that automatically 'fixes' failing transactions by mutating them instead of causing them to be be rejected completely (I understand code for this already exists, but isn't public)-- a prospect which is much less unappealing now that malleability attacks are already going on. However, if LowS becomes even more widespread quickly this change alone may be enough.\n\nIf anyone wants to do some sleuthing on which software is still producing HighS signatures, here is a list of addresses recently (but before the recent spate of attacks) involved in a HighS signature: https://people.xiph.org/~greg/high-s-reusecnt.log ...\n",
