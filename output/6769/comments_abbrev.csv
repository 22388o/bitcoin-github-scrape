gmaxwell,2015-10-06T03:54:46Z,For discussion.\n\nRecent measurements have suggested that somewhere between 85-95% of all transactions are already conforming.  I've subsequently gone around and caused several parties (like electrum) to update their behavior.\n\nThis could also be coupled with a change that automatically 'fixes' failing transactions by mutating them instead of causing them to be be rejected completely (I underst,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6769#issuecomment-145735385,145735385,
