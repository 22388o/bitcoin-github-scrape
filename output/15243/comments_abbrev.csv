instagibbs,2019-01-24T15:50:04Z,"If you suggest this, people will do it, and things will break. Why not have them do the latter and make a new file?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15243#discussion_r250662197,250662197,doc/developer-notes.md
jnewbery,2019-01-24T16:13:28Z,"I think it's up to the individual contributor, but I'm happy to change this to just suggest using `release-notes-XXXXX.md`.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15243#discussion_r250673436,250673436,doc/developer-notes.md

promag,2019-01-24T17:40:19Z,"IMO I'd leave both - the PR author has the right to update `doc/release-notes.md`, especially if he wants to work out existing text.\n\nThere's also the case where one PR XXX updates `release-notes-YYY.md`\n\n> to avoid conflicts between multiple PRs.\n\nIMO the conflicts in release notes shouldn't be postponed to release time.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15243#discussion_r250709002,250709002,doc/developer-notes.md

promag,2019-01-24T17:58:06Z,"I think that's fine, that also happens with code and must be fixed accordingly. I'm not against individual files, both options are valid for me.\n\nAnyway, looks like now I'm forced to write individual release notes. See #15193 for instance, would you NACK it because it doesn't create an individual file?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15243#discussion_r250715260,250715260,doc/developer-notes.md

jnewbery,2019-01-24T20:32:16Z,"I don't want to make this prescriptive that you can't write notes in release-notes.md, and I certainly wouldn't want to encourage ""please move release notes to a separate file"" review comments. However, I agree with instagibbs that only presenting one action is better.\n\nI'm happy to go either way.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15243#discussion_r250765937,250765937,doc/developer-notes.md
