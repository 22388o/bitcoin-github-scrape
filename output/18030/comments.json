If we're using a `Coin` in the null state to indicate \"no UTXO\", then it seems natural to define truthiness on the `Coin` object where false indicates no UTXO and true indicates UTXO.\r\n\r\nEven after this PR, there are still places where this is confusing, eg:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/d2a78ee9288e4d3bace9125bcfae6b7747f85982/src/node/transaction.cpp#L47-L50\r\n\r\nBetter to update the interface to be intuitive than keep the outdated name and add comments about why it's confusing.",
