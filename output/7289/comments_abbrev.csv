MarcoFalke,2016-01-04T17:50:44Z,Concept ACK. Clearly makes sense for some args. (c.f. `setmocktime`)\n\nNot sure if this should be enabled for all args. (Setting minRelayTxFee may result in unexpected behavior.)\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7289#issuecomment-168750299,168750299,
jgarzik,2016-01-04T17:55:38Z,"Rough concept ACK.\n\nTo speak generally and scope the problem, each setting has been written with the idea that it is largely static throughout program runtime.\n\nAt an engineering level, you have to revisit each setting in the context of thread safety, as well as wider impacts such as, e.g. changing min-relay-tx-fee and then running with a mempool temporarily disjoint from that value (or, alter",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7289#issuecomment-168751521,168751521,
jonasschnelli,2016-01-04T19:47:52Z,"Concept ACK.\nAgree with @jgarzik.\n\nCurrently, your new `setarg` command only protects the variable by `cs_main` (and `cs_wallet`). Not sure if that would be sufficient (IMO it wouldn't be sufficient for net limits (-maxuploadtarget)).\nInstead of directly accessing globals vars, a setter/getter (could also be global) in the according code region would result in a better, cleaner code (or a clas",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7289#issuecomment-168782378,168782378,
