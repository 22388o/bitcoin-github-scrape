jgarzik,2011-05-06T12:01:41Z,"I do not have any specific technical objection, but I just don't think this belongs in bitcoind.

genjix,2011-05-06T17:16:03Z,"Why? My branch has much more technical depth than that other one. It's also written cleaner and much easier to extend. The other branch is simply looking up an address, whereas I have signing the requests and an example server for setting your address written in PHP.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/169#issuecomment-1112436,1112436,
cdhowie,2011-05-06T17:38:40Z,"IMO there is not enough security in something like this.  It suffers from the same problem that IP-based transactions do, namely that it is subject to MITM attacks.  This approach is further subject to DNS poisoning attacks.\n\nIf this is going to work securely, the request must be made over HTTPS, and the server's certificate must be verified somehow.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/169#issuecomment-1112542,1112542,

sneak,2011-08-23T00:04:41Z,"I agree that this sort of endpoint-to-address discovery should _not_ be in bitcoind.  There are several big problems:\n\n1) Lack of widely-deployed DNSSEC means this is hard to secure\n2) It doesn't use SSL, and probably shouldn't use HTTP(S) at all.  DNS SRV or TXT records would be better for such a scheme.\n3) The URL scheme is half-baked.
