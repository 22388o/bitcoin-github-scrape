There are several big problems:\n\n1) Lack of widely-deployed DNSSEC means this is hard to secure\n2) It doesn't use SSL, and probably shouldn't use HTTP(S) at all.  DNS SRV or TXT records would be better for such a scheme.\n3) The URL scheme is half-baked.  \"getaddress\" says nothing about bitcoin and could easily conflict with other uses of a website.
