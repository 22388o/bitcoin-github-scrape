The -quiet arg was actually my first motivation, to be able to less painfully compare results or share them, most of which for me have the verbose >5% err unstable warnings even when all the recommendations are followed, and it takes an annoying amount of time to edit out all the warnings by hand. People can see the %err, so for sharing results the noisy warnings are quite pollutive and it's so handy to be able to silence them.",

    "body": "I do not think adding an iterations argument that work like that is a good idea. `nanobench` itself already has the ability to perform multiple measurements (called \"epoch\" in `nanobench`), in fact each benchmark is already measured 11 times. That way it is able to show a measurement error. The number of iterations in each of the measurements is determined automatically, based on the computer's clock accuracy.\r\n\r\nIf you get unstable benchmark results, the first thing to do should be to make sure the computer is really stable: no frequency scaling, no turbo, no other interfering programs. `nanobench` shows the warnings for good reason :slightly_smiling_face: \r\n\r\nIf that doesn't help, make sure the actual benchmark itself is stable and actually always does the same (few randomness in it, better not have much allocations, threadding, locks, etc).\r\n\r\nIf that too doesn't help, you can e.g. increase the number of iterations with [minEpochIterations](https://nanobench.ankerl.com/reference.html#_CPPv4N6ankerl9nanobench5Bench18minEpochIterationsE8uint64_t). That's a bit problematic though because some benchmarks need a huge setting here, others a very low one. So generally it is probably better use [minEpochTime](https://nanobench.ankerl.com/reference.html#_CPPv4N6ankerl9nanobench5Bench12minEpochTimeENSt6chrono11nanosecondsE) and expose that setting in the arguments (probably as double value in seconds, e.g. like `-minEpochTime=0.5`)",
