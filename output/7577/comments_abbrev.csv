kirkalx,2016-03-01T21:24:30Z,"From the initial work I've done on updating some of Jonas's other wallet patches, this is familiar and I agree it can be confusing, especially in some of the more complicated changes where wallet code calls some other wallet code with its own error handling. The intention is to end up with at least one (and preferably only one) error message in the log if something goes wrong.
