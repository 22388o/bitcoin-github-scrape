jnewbery,2020-03-14 16:46:50,"Concept ACK fixing issue 1. Like @MarcoFalke says, the probability of this ever causing a failure is negligible, but it's better that the test's assumptions are accurate.\n\nFor issue 2 (`next_block` not recalculating the digest if `solve` is `False`), I think we can just remove the `solve` parameter from that function and always solve the block. The function is only called with `solve=False` in",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18350#issuecomment-599095725,599095725,
TheQuantumPhysicist,2020-03-14 16:46:51,"> If this was ever the cause of a test failure, it probably means our assumption about hash functions is broken.\n\nActually you're right about the first fix, but the second one has a much higher likelihood to happen. I was able to simulate it by putting it on the tip of the block 1 and it happened always within a loop of 1000 tests that repeat b47's test case.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18350#issuecomment-599095733,599095733,
