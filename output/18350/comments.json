    "body": "Concept ACK fixing issue 1. Like @MarcoFalke says, the probability of this ever causing a failure is negligible, but it's better that the test's assumptions are accurate.\r\n\r\nFor issue 2 (`next_block` not recalculating the digest if `solve` is `False`), I think we can just remove the `solve` parameter from that function and always solve the block. The function is only called with `solve=False` in two places, and in both cases the nonce is recalculated (to be invalid for block 47, and resolved for block 48).",
