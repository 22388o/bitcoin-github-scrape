csyangchen,2012-06-06T12:19:42Z,"I think the old one is preferred if I want to parse Startup time from log file, not caring whether or not the log file tracks timestamp.\n\nPS: I think the timestamp format itself is a little bit redundant.

rebroad,2012-06-06T13:44:13Z,"@csyangchen if one is wanting to parse start up times from the log file with timestamps turned on, one wouldn't use the startup time line anyway, but the first line with ""Bitcoin version"", or the line after ""Default data directory"". The ""startup time"" line is entirely redundant with timestamps enabled.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1427#issuecomment-6150871,6150871,
csyangchen,2012-06-06T16:11:11Z,"@rebroad I agree with the point you made. However, a redundant line in debug won't hurt, just not worthy of a separate pull, IMO.\n\nPreviously (appeared at least in v0.6.0, fixed by now ) there is a duplicated timestamp output in main.cpp, on the recv message: ""timestamp timestamp received: ..."". That, I think, is a duplication worthy of fix, considering frequency of the recv message.\n\nIf we ac",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1427#issuecomment-6155046,6155046,

rebroad,2012-07-02T20:35:14Z,"@luke-jr everything takes so long to compile on my laptop, as due to the way git works, it causes all file modification times to be changed, so make tried to recompile everything. If I could work out a way for make to use checksums instead of modification times, then my compiles wouldn't take so long, and I'd have tested this. thanks for the fix!\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1427#issuecomment-6719094,6719094,
