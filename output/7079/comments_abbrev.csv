dgenr8,2015-11-25T02:16:38Z,"> e.g. not allowing duplicate INVs even for objects we'd mempool retired but now would be accept again.\n\nThat's a bug in CTxMemPool::Expire.  It should clean the tx out of all setInventoryKnowns anyway, else we won't try to re-inv it to peers when it comes in again.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7079#issuecomment-159466291,159466291,
gmaxwell,2015-11-25T05:05:19Z,"@dgenr8 I don't think it is, or at least it's debatable... we won't reinv to peers we already INVed it to-- they may well still have it-- we should still reinv to anyone we haven't.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7079#issuecomment-159493079,159493079,

dgenr8,2015-11-25T22:02:34Z,"@gmaxwell Ah well, as long as the attack is mitigated.  It's also possible to drop the timeout to 20s (from 2m) and only miss a response 1% of the time.  .4% at 30s.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7079#issuecomment-159741566,159741566,
gmaxwell,2015-11-25T22:35:14Z,The timeouts must be set very conservatively or otherwise a congested node (e.g. one under dos attack) can exhaust itself with repeated transmissions. You cannot count on the average case measured on a node with good connectivity.\n\nI'm also not particularly interested if someone-- with a bunch of work-- can delay a transaction by a couple minutes; it's not a very interesting attack compared to s,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7079#issuecomment-159746834,159746834,
