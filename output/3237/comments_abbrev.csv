laanwj,2013-11-12T07:42:28Z,"@diapolo If I understand this correctly you're giving yourself too little credit. This does not only silence warnings, but it _fixes printf format strings throughout the source code_ for Windows builds.\n\nACK in any case\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3237#issuecomment-28274159,28274159,

laanwj,2013-11-12T11:55:12Z,@diapolo Can you try removing the inttypes.h include completely on WIN32? I think it's only used for PRId64 (and friends) at this point and we shouldn't use C99 headers on WIN32.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3237#issuecomment-28287549,28287549,

brandondahler,2013-11-13T04:55:29Z,"@Diapolo this only coincidentally fixes most instances of the warning because util.h is depended on by almost every file (indirectly at least). The inttypes.h include is spread across all of the files that use PRI[xdu]64 directly.\n\nI would rather spend some time getting rid of all of the *printf functions and replace them with [i,o][,f,string]streams where appropriate.  Once that is done, there ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3237#issuecomment-28364678,28364678,
laanwj,2013-11-13T07:26:59Z,It is quite urgent to fix this because it breaks strprintf on Windows XP and earlier (see http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/mingw-w64/wiki/gnu%20printf)\n\n@brandondahler have you checked how much strprintf is used? There's at least 130 direct usages. Converting that all to iostreams would be a massive endavour. Had I realized that inttypes.h was C99 I would not have ACKed your refactor :/ `\n\nSo ,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3237#issuecomment-28372327,28372327,
