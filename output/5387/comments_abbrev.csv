jonasschnelli,2014-11-27T19:12:30Z,Nice work.\nIdea for improvements:\n1. Could the script be parameterized to just clang-format the files which are in the current tracked by git?\n2.

sipa,2014-11-28T10:30:49Z,So I think a requirement here is that the formatting can be reproduced by others.\n\nI got my clang-format-3.5 from (apt sources line):\n\n```\ndeb http://llvm.org/apt/trusty/ llvm-toolchain-trusty-3.5 main\n```\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5387#issuecomment-64879154,64879154,
laanwj,2014-11-28T11:28:34Z,"Concluding from the discussion on IRC I think it would be better to postpone this until clang-format is more stable. Even different versions within 3.5 give different results - or at least: the clang-format-3.5 in Ubuntu 14.04 refuses to accept the input file completely, and in 3.6 some more things change (see the diff in my above post).\n\nTo make this repeatable we would have to lock in one spec",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5387#issuecomment-64884398,64884398,
