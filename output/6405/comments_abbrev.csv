luke-jr,2015-07-09T06:10:14Z,Priority-sorted area followed by fee/kB-sorted area (the previous default policy) would be the most obvious one.

domob1812,2015-07-09T18:19:41Z,"I actually like the concept of priority, which means that coinage can be used to ""pay"" for fees as a spam prevention.  The ""production rate"" of coinage is bounded, which means that one can set a minimum priority for transactions and a certain reserved size in each block and be ensured that, on average, all free transactions fit in this reserved block space forever.
