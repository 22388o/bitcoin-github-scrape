practicalswift,2020-11-08 22:15:39,"Concept ACK\n\nVery nice first-time contribution @tylerchambers! Warm welcome as a contributor! ❤️ \n\nTo guard against this type of error entering our code base: consider enabling the `flake8` check `F632` in our `lint-python.sh` linter. That check would have caught this issue, but we're currently not opt-ing in to it :)\n\n```\n$ flake8 --select F632 contrib/devtools/security-check.py\nc",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20346#issuecomment-723673749,723673749,
