MarcoFalke,2016-01-25T07:09:46Z,"I guess you'd need a BIP and universal support to do so.\n\nQuoting @sipa \n\n>  In my opinion, the correct way to do a hard fork is to first see if there is universal support for it, and when so, schedule it for 1 year in the future or so. No vote needed; everyone knows they have to upgrade by that time. There can still be a miner vote after that 1 year to be sure miners _also_ agree to the chang",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7410#issuecomment-174422035,174422035,
laanwj,2016-01-25T13:07:48Z,"I'm not sure how much sense it makes to do an emergency hard-fork to protect against a hard-fork. A change of PoW is something that would make most sense for the side of the hard-fork that forks off - as they're changing consensus behavior already.\n\nNo matter what, definitely needs a BIP and discussion on the mailing list. This would need a change to many other software: at least every miner and",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7410#issuecomment-174503953,174503953,

keo,2016-01-25T21:29:25Z,"""when miners misbehave"" - really?\n\nBitcoin's protocol IS consensus.
