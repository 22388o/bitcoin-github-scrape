But it would give the opportunity to slowly decouple the wallet from the rest of the core.\nIt's unclear why we have a runtime linking of rpc commands and there are probably way better solutions of a dynamic handling of the rpc commands dispatching.\nBut these are out of the PRs focus.\n\nLongterm goals to achieve with this P,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5934#issuecomment-84682587,84682587,

jonasschnelli,2015-06-21T10:42:58Z,@jtimon: will do soon. But maybe this PR #6006 makes more sense. What do you think?\n\nThis PR would need a better locking mechanism.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5934#issuecomment-113883718,113883718,
