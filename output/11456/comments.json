The help text still reads correct to me (it still limits you to only that one connection), the only thing it changes is that previously we would disconnect-on-VERSION-message for -connect peers which do not set NODE_NETWORK, now we will keep it connected just the same as -addnode peers. If you think thats a critical change to document I'm happy to do so, but I think thats a rather esoteric case for -connect.",

Though, I believe that these lines demonstrate why \"Desirable\" is so awkward:\r\n```c++\r\nif (!fFeeler && !HasAllDesirableServiceFlags(addr.nServices)) {\r\n    continue;\r\n    } else if (fFeeler && !MayHaveUsefulAddressDB(addr.nServices)) {\r\n    continue;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n```MayHaveUsefulAddressDB()``` is explicit in what it's checking, but ```HasAllDesirableServiceFlags()``` is not.\r\n\r\nI'd be much more comfortable with this (and I think it'd be much more straightforward) if ```HasAllDesirableServiceFlags()``` was replaced with two or three different functions, each representing an explicit functionality check. e.g.: ```MayServeSomeWitnessBlocks()```, ```MayServeAllWitnessBlocks()```, etc.\r\n\r\nAfter all, that's what we're _really_ trying to figure out, right?\r\n\r\nThen the flag checks aren't dependent on app state, because those checks are done in a straightforward way by the caller instead:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nif ((in_ibd && MayServeAllWitnessBlocks(services))\r\n  || (!in_ibd && MayServeSomeWitnessBlocks(services))) {\r\n    request()\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat also means that \"Desirable\" doesn't have to share the same meaning everywhere. The obvious example where that's useful is the eviction logic.\r\n\r\nSo... basically just a glorified version of the previous binary logic, except that the functions understand cases where multiple flags may be suitable.",

    "body": "The goal with the naming was to allow the place that owns network logic to have a function which captures whether a peer is interesting to us. Point being you want some function which captures everything net wants to avoid knowing about, even if that's some crazy wrapper for MayServe*WitnessBlocks, that wrapper should still exist outside of CConnman/net. Ideally, eventually, this will be in net_processing.h (ie the place where we know about what stuff we want out of our peers), but the circular deps right now make that a mess. Lacking net_processing being able to take it, protocol.h or some new header seems most reasonable to me.",

    "body": "The reason for `CNode::nExpected` wasn't so much enforcing services, but checking whether we're connecting out to the right node.\r\n\r\nMany of our assumptions on partition resistance and privacy are based on the fact that outgoing connections are more under our control. If we're making an outgoing connection, and the node we end up connecting to has different service flags than what we expect - even if they're 'better' - we're likely not connected to who we thought we were. If that's the case, I believe it's better to disconnect and pick another node we want to connect to, rather than accepting wasting an outbound connection slot on an unknown peer.",

    "body": "@theuni My view is that at connection time, we're making a certain determination of what to connect to, with biases based on (among other things) the service flags of all things in addrman. Disconnecting if you see that what you connected to was based on wrong information just gives everything a new chance (including the peer you just connected to). In the end, what node you end up connecting to has the same probability distribution to the one you'd have if you had perfect information (about the nodes you tried) from the start. Using nExpected means all the biasing logic can be encapsulated inside the outgoing-connection-logic, without needing to reason about corrections afterwards.\r\n\r\nTalking to @TheBlueMatt about this, I agree that this pretty abstract, as we don't actually want to bias based on service flags anymore (at least for the time being), and even after BIP159, it will likely be a boolean acceptable or not, instead of a complicated bias.\r\n\r\nSo, I withdraw my objection.",
