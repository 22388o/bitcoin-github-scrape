ryanofsky,2020-04-08 20:03:33,"> Why is `const int ... = 1;` not a compile time constant?\n\nCan you give a more specific example? In the example from the PR description, the compiler does not know what the value of `SYMBOL` is when you include `foo.h` and use `SYMBOL` in compiled code, so it is misleading or at least a stretch to call `SYMBOL` a ""compile time constant"". In this example, `SYMBOL` is just const in the sense th",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18568#issuecomment-611165190,611165190,
