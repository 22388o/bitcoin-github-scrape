If this is accepted, clients can import multiple addresses by calling `import*` multiple times, which would incur in unnecessary rescans. `importmulti` is tweaked to scan only once for the given the batch. \n\nShould have tests.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13464#issuecomment-397126435,397126435,

If it has been once discussed to not add this functionality, then no point to do that again. \n\nJust some additional thoughts:\n1) shouldn't `importaddress`, `importprivkey` and `importpubkey` output some warnings they are deprecated in favour of `importmulti`?\n2) shouldn't ""Hint: use importmulti to import more than one private key"" help mess",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13464#issuecomment-397392745,397392745,
