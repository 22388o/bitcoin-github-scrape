It's been added as of XCode 8 on September 13, 2016. I'm uneasy with that as a minimum requirement.\r\n\r\nFrom [Apple docs](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/WhatsNewXcode/Chapters/xcode_8_0.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004635-SW1):  \"Xcode 8.1 requires a Mac running macOS 10.11.5 or later\". We still support [macOS 10.10](https://github.com/chaincoin/chaincoin/pull/573). We could consider bumping that to 10.11.5, or accept that some tests won't run.\r\n\r\n> Additionally, last time I checked this, the use of thread_local causes new symbols to be pulled in from glibc on Linux, meaning that we would lose back-compat with older versions. I'd have to re-test to see where the break lies.\r\n\r\nSo perhaps this depends on if we drop e.g. Ubuntu Trusty 14.04 in the next release.",

    "body": "@MarcoFalke That reasoning seems backwards. We identify what C++ version (and features) we can use based on the platforms we want to support. I don't mean to say that this particular change is a problem, but just because we're considering C++14 does not mean we should drop support for every platform that doesn't support every feature from C++11 or C++14.\n\nDoes this mean we have now removed support for OSX 10.10 for the unit tests with this change?",

Afaik it takes a patch with an `ifdef` to restore support for the majority of tests. @jonasschnelli might be able to confirm since he has VMs with older macOS versions.",
