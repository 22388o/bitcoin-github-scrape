laanwj,2012-05-13T18:27:11Z,"I wish there was a way to change the English translation without invalidating all the translated messages... Or at least update the source string for all translations automatically, when there is no substantial difference.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1288#issuecomment-5678245,5678245,
Diapolo,2012-05-13T18:31:44Z,"This would be a nice thing, but Qts same text heuristic doesn't cover such things.\n\nEdit: All this leads to one thing, take more care if doing strings in the client that need a translations as this is a great plus in terms of UX!\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1288#issuecomment-5678298,5678298,
laanwj,2012-05-13T19:03:41Z,"I think you could actually set the strings as ""translation"" strings in bitcoin-en.ts instead?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1288#issuecomment-5678555,5678555,

laanwj,2012-05-13T19:22:36Z,"If you open bitcoin-en.ts in Qt translator and set the new messages there, it will change the message shown in English clients without changing the message in the source code, so without affecting the other translations.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1288#issuecomment-5678702,5678702,
Diapolo,2012-05-13T19:30:54Z,"This would be less invasive, but produce an ugly inconsistency for the en translation-file and the source ... I don't really like that idea. A form of %RPC_Con_Information_Label_text% in the source and translations only in the lang-files, but that would even further raise the complexity.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1288#issuecomment-5678760,5678760,
laanwj,2012-05-13T19:37:50Z,"I don't like it either. But I also don't like it if 20 translators have to re-translate a message just because a space was removed, or a dot was added, for example.\n\nTransifex also has no way to edit a source message.
