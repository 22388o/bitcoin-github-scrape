laanwj,2015-11-24T08:29:09Z,"Right. What we use amounts to only one file (`authproxy.py`), and it is a very stable library, so it is easier to just copy it and make it part of the test framework than keep around a subtree. The subtree needed a circuitous work-around (updating sys.path) to use it in place.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7052#issuecomment-159193701,159193701,
