luke-jr,2015-11-27T21:10:23Z,This is kinda ugly (per-node start instead of per-tx). IMO we shouldn't opt-in by default until Core can actually double-spend them itself.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7119#issuecomment-160203773,160203773,
petertodd,2015-11-28T09:08:59Z,"@TheBlueMatt Thanks, fixed.\n\n@luke-jr Yeah, per-tx would be nice, but that'll take a lot more work on UX and RPC calls.\n\nRe: default, remember that we don't try to make any guarantees about the likely hood that a tx will be mined according to what the recipient needs re: double-spending. For instance, a low fee tx is very easy to double-spend, and we'll happily produce them. Similarly we'll ha",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7119#issuecomment-160265596,160265596,
