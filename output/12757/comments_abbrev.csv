practicalswift,2018-03-22T18:05:35Z,@promag `contrib/devtools/lint-*.sh` is executed automatically by Travis (via `lint-all.sh` which is run as part of `CHECK_DOC=1`). In other words `contrib/devtools/lint-include-guards.sh` will be executed by Travis â€“ no need to reference it explicitly :-),https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12757#issuecomment-375404287,375404287,

eklitzke,2018-03-22T18:17:28Z,Do you really need bitcoin-config.h and build.h in here? They're auto-generated so I would have thought git ls-files wouldn't have listed them.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12757#discussion_r176523663,176523663,contrib/devtools/lint-include-guards.sh
eklitzke,2018-03-22T18:18:06Z,You should probably add a copyright notice to this file.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12757#discussion_r176523903,176523903,contrib/devtools/lint-include-guards.sh
promag,2018-03-22T23:05:49Z,Could use `git ls-files -x` instead of `| grep -vE`?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12757#discussion_r176597979,176597979,contrib/devtools/lint-include-guards.sh

practicalswift,2018-03-22T23:12:35Z,"@promag No I don't think so (`-x` is for untracked files, right?) :-)\n\nI'd be glad to be proven wrong so provide an equivalent using `git ls-files -x` and I'll switch :-)",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12757#discussion_r176599145,176599145,contrib/devtools/lint-include-guards.sh
