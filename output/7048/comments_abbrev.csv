laanwj,2015-11-18T15:16:28Z,Taking a step back here:\n- Why do we need specific instructions about building upnp at all? Those should be documented by the miniupnp project.\n- Using upnp isn't encouraged...\n- People that build from source generally know how to set up port forwardings.\n\nMy new proposal: let's remove this section. Optionally replace with a pointer to the miniupnpc docs.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7048#issuecomment-157745012,157745012,
