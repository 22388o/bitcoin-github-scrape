The above comment is simply on the concept.

Accepting wallet JSON-RPC arguments doesn't prevent us from restricting access to wallets based on endpoint or user authorization in the future.

I think in general this could be a dangerous side effect of supporting a \"default wallet\" for RPC calls in any of the 4 PRs. A user could accidentally forget to specify the wallet in a single API call, and wind up affecting a different wallet than intended. Maybe it would be good to kill the notion of a \"default wallet\" for RPCs entirely by requiring the wallet to be explicitly specified whenever more than one is loaded. This could be done by returning null from `GetWalletForJSONRPCRequest` whenever `vpwallets.size() > 1` when no wallet is specified in any of the PRs.\r\n",

    "body": "> Longer term, if we do separate wallets out into separate processes, then I think multiple endpoints (#10650) makes sense.\r\n\r\nFWIW, I was implementing RPC dispatch to wallet processes yesterday and found the opposite. With #10653 and #10661, rpc/server.cpp can take the wallet name directly from the RPC params and dispatch the request to the right wallet process, while with #10653, because the wallet URL demangling happens in `GetWalletForJSONRPCRequest` which is called by individual wallet methods, the RPC server has no way of knowing which wallet process to forward incoming requests to, so the URL demangling logic either has to be moved, or the server has to forward RPC requests to multiple wallet processes.\r\n\r\nI don't think these issues are very significant, but I'm just pointing this out because I think discussion around wallet process separation and multiwallet RPC support has been muddled and confused. I think pretty much any multiwallet RPC selection mechanism could be made to work cleanly with different multiprocess setups. I also think that the best multiprocess setup would just let wallet processes handle RPC calls on their own, which would eliminate the need for any multiwallet RPC selection mechanism.\r\n",

    "body": "> @ryanofsky The reason why endpoints are preferable as a preparation for multiprocess has nothing to do with the server side, but with the client side. Having clients treat your wallet as a separate endpoint means they're well prepared for a future where it's a separate process - just change the endpoint.\r\n\r\nThanks, that is helpful. I was thinking all along that endpoints are an unnecessary and mildly obnoxious change to want to roll out right now, but I guess you are saying the obnoxiousness is more of a feature than a bug because it will prepare users for more obnoxiousness in the future. Or maybe that's not a completely fair description, but I think I get the idea a little better now.",
