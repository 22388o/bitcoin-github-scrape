sdaftuar,2016-10-13T20:00:01Z,"Looks to be a bug in the test where the block manufactured in the test is of a too-low version, due to soft-fork activations in the regtest chain.  Only seems to manifest itself in the 0.13 branch because we hardcoded the soft-fork activation points in master to be at block heights that are slightly higher than the test, I believe.\n\nQuick fix would be to explicitly set the block versions generat",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8916#discussion_r83298887,83298887,qa/rpc-tests/p2p-compactblocks.py
