meshcollider,2017-09-02T12:19:53Z,"@luke-jr the style refactor only touches a tiny amount of code inside that single function, in a similar way to adding braces to existing if-statements when modifying nearby code. I'd argue that this small change to existing code style is worth it for the consistency, especially between try_witness and try_no_witness",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11178#issuecomment-326740892,326740892,
