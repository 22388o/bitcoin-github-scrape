gmaxwell,2017-09-26T04:42:34Z,NAK. This seems to be a straightforward reduction in functionality for no obvious reason.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11404#issuecomment-332084771,332084771,
esotericnonsense,2017-09-26T15:10:20Z,NACK echoing comments above,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11404#issuecomment-332230516,332230516,
jtimon,2017-09-26T17:36:09Z,"The reason is to simplify the code and configuration. Chainparams is abused for many things that have nothing to do with the chain itself, like defaults for other options (like in this case).\nI don't consider this a reduction in functionality but a simplification in the configuration. The functionality is selecting the rpc port, which can still be done.\n\nI would also remove GetDefaultPort, D",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11404#issuecomment-332276202,332276202,
sipa,2017-09-26T17:40:50Z,"@jtimon Simplification is a good thing, but maybe you're missing the functionality this brings. The P2P network heavily favors nodes that run on the default port (there is a bias for them when making outgoing connections - preventing DoS attacks on third party services, and DNS seeds can only give results that run on the default port). Further you're ccomplicating running both testnet and mainnet ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11404#issuecomment-332277540,332277540,
jtimon,2017-09-26T18:31:18Z,"Running mainnet and testnet in the same machine would just -rpcport=18332 (for example) for testnet.\nI assume the default port thing applies to CChainParams::GetDefaultPort not BaseParams().RPCPort().\n\nBut yeah, I didn't know about that.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11404#issuecomment-332292618,332292618,
