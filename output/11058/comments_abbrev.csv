TheBlueMatt,2017-08-17T16:17:14Z,Looks like you lost the stuff noting what vSolutionsRet is when you moved the comment from standard.cpp.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11058#discussion_r133760620,133760620,src/script/standard.h

TheBlueMatt,2017-08-17T16:23:38Z,"Maybe note that this only works on some standard scriptPubKey types (eg currently does not work on segwit types, nor null_data, for obvious reasons).",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11058#discussion_r133762213,133762213,src/script/standard.h
jnewbery,2017-08-17T18:01:49Z,(specifically that vSolutionsRet is a vector of the public keys or hashes from the scriptPubKey),https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11058#discussion_r133786041,133786041,src/script/standard.h
jimpo,2017-08-17T18:56:57Z,"I'm not sure if that's necessary to add here. This is the byte limit for OP_RETURN scripts, then `IsStandardTx` further restricts the number of OP_RETURN outputs per tx to 1. If this comment were to say `per transaction` it sort of implies that the data can be split across multiple OP_RETURN outputs as long as the limit is not exceeded.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11058#discussion_r133800002,133800002,src/script/standard.h
jimpo,2017-08-17T19:00:05Z,"Happy to add if you prefer, but that seems like something that the implementation might change. Is it possible that a new `CTxDestination` for witness programs will be added? It's also interesting that this function does not return a `CNoDestination` for `TX_NULL_DATA` scripts.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11058#discussion_r133800825,133800825,src/script/standard.h
TheBlueMatt,2017-08-21T01:32:29Z,"Ahh, missed that it was applied per-scriptPubKey and had an independant per-tx limit, yea, fine as-is.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11058#discussion_r134133396,134133396,src/script/standard.h
TheBlueMatt,2017-08-21T01:33:10Z,"Sure, but we can also update the comment when the implementation changes to support more :)",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11058#discussion_r134133432,134133432,src/script/standard.h
