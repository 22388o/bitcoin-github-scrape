Per a [conversation](http://www.erisian.com.au/bitcoin-core-dev/log-2019-08-16.html#l-62) with @fanquake a few days ago, I'd been working on my own combining of the detached notes with edits and the addition of notes for some PRs that hadn't been documented.  My first commit is basically the same as your two commits, but there are differences in my line wrapping and itemizing that would make it hard for me to rebase my edits on top of this PR.",
