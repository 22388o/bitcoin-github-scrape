All appveyor caching has already been removed. Predominantly due to nasty issues with the cached vcpkg dependencies getting messed up between different PR branches.\n\nWith this new manifest approach it might be feasible to re-introduce a cache of the v",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19960#issuecomment-700699668,700699668,

It seems that build takes approximately 10 minutes longer subsequent to the change in this PR.\n\nOne possibility is the `vcpkg` dependencies may now be being built for both debug and release.

sipsorcery,2020-09-19 10:12:28,You beat me to it and as you've mentioned it's arbitrary. The version field (https://vcpkg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/specifications/manifests/) seems to be intended for use when creating vcpkg port files rather than consuming them. It is a mandatory field though so has to be set to something. I've gone ahead and set it to `1` to avoid any perception it relates to any other release or version number,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19960#discussion_r491364588,491364588,build_msvc/vcpkg.json
