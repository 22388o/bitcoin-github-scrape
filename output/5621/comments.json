(5621 was at 3 of 3 shortly after opening the PR)  Sorry, the host isn't fast.\n\nI would accept 5619 if, after a more testing we're not surprised by any additional places where an exception here could escape.   Though, ... I'm not sure we should be using exceptions for critical failures while we are still using them for normal conditions. Eliminating them from normal conditions would require a substantial rewrite of the network deserialization code, so asserting on the critical failures is the thing to do if you buy into my argument that we shouldn't be mixing them.\n",
