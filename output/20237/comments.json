    "body": "> I confirm that running python3 generate-seeds.py . > ../../src/chainparamsseeds.h locally generates identical result.\r\n\r\n@jonatack @vasild Thanks for checking !\r\n\r\n> Maybe as a future improvement we may devise some deterministic way to generate the seeds, so that everybody can generate seeds.txt and confirm http://bitcoin.sipa.be/seeds.txt.gz is not compromised. Or at least that there is a significant overlap between that file from bitcoin.sipa.be and a locally generated.\r\n\r\nYes, maybe.\r\nGiven the same `seeds.txt.gz` it should be deterministic already. Well, I guess the ASN mapping could change\u2026\r\nI could upload mine somewhere but I don't think it would prove anything. The thing is that the `seeds.txt.gz` on the server changes continuously, and there is no way to prove that mine was ever the current state there and hasn't been tampered with.\r\n\r\nThe topic of improvements to the seed generation comes up every time just before the release and then dies down immediately after it. I'm happy for someone to put effort in this though. See also #17020 which ahs quite the TODO list alrady :smile: ",
