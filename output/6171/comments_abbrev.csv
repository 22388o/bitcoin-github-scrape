posita,2015-07-30T20:57:42Z,"FYI, I'm still seeing intermittent deadlocks in `test_bitcoin`, even in [`v0.11.0`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/v0.11.0). I'll see if I can get a dump from `gdb --pid ""$( pidof test_bitcoin )""` the next time I observe it.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6171#issuecomment-126485236,126485236,
posita,2015-08-08T23:14:51Z,"Hmmm, I'm only seeing occasional deadlocks in `v0.11.0` with debugging symbols removed (e.g., via `eu-strip .../bin/test_bitcoin`). They may also happen with a binary whose debugging symbols are intact, but I haven't observed that (yet).\n\nHere's what I found:\n\n``` sh\n% eu-strip -f .../bin/test_bitcoin.debug .../bin/test_bitcoin\n% # Run test_bitcoin in another shell and wait for it to hang\n%",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6171#issuecomment-129065604,129065604,
laanwj,2015-08-10T16:00:44Z,"Yes, could be that there is another deadlock. Haven't noticed one myself yet, though, not even on travis.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6171#issuecomment-129507245,129507245,
posita,2015-08-10T17:21:44Z,"@laanwj, are you running binaries with or without debugging symbols in your Travis builds? As I mentioned. I have not yet seen this deadlock happen with a binary with debugging symbols. FYI, I filed #6540 to track this further.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6171#issuecomment-129534112,129534112,
