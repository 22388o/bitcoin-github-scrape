laanwj,2018-09-17T12:56:11Z,"namedtuple defines a type: please use CamelCase for the name (e.g. `AddressKeyPair`) and define it outside of the function\n(see other uses of namedtuple for consistency)",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14236#discussion_r218056851,218056851,test/functional/test_framework/test_node.py

promag,2018-09-17T21:27:57Z,"nit, in remaining tests this auxiliary function is not used, maybe it could be removed and inline where necessary.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14236#discussion_r218233912,218233912,test/functional/rpc_preciousblock.py
MarcoFalke,2018-09-17T22:03:57Z,There are 5 instances of calling `gen_address` in this test. I think in-lining would make this test overly verbose.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14236#discussion_r218242695,218242695,test/functional/rpc_preciousblock.py
promag,2018-09-17T22:37:55Z,"IMO it should be consistent, which helps in moving code around, copy&paste and readability. So either expose the auxiliary function or inline everywhere.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14236#discussion_r218249739,218249739,test/functional/rpc_preciousblock.py
sanket1729,2018-09-17T23:14:14Z,"My rationale was make a clean looking code. Wherever there were many occurrences for the call to `get_deterministic_priv_key()`, I used a variable (in 1 test case where there was only 1 node) and auxiliary function in this test(where there are multiple nodes).
