S3RK,2020-06-26 10:39:51,"> IIUC this doesn't let us detect problems with clean shutdowns?\n\n@promag Thanks for the question, I forgot to address this point indeed. There are many tests that stop/start nodes cleanly _during the execution_. If we want we can even create a dedicated test to verify proper node shutdown. This change only affects the procedure when we shutdown test environment _after the test_ itself is perf",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19384#issuecomment-650112352,650112352,

instagibbs,2020-06-30 15:21:05,"-0, if the gains aren't huge I don't think it's worth the squeeze. Although I agree that we shouldn't be counting on test ends to be testing clean shutdown behavior.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19384#issuecomment-651863184,651863184,
