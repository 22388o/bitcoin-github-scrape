MarcoFalke,2017-01-05T15:19:01Z,"This has already been attempted in #8801, but was deferred until later due the merge conflicts it would cause.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier today, it probably makes sense to get the tagged pull requests for 0.14 in first. Then, after the feature freeze, decide which boost refactoring should be included in 0.14.\n\nEdit: Other relevant comment: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/8718#issuec",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9478#issuecomment-270668667,270668667,
kallewoof,2017-01-06T01:25:26Z,@MarcoFalke I was hoping it would be manageable by keeping it in multiple commits and cherry picking as desired. But didn't realize it was duplicate of existing work. Should've checked! Thanks for the feedback :),https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9478#issuecomment-270806789,270806789,
MarcoFalke,2017-01-06T10:56:10Z,"Indeed there is no reason to do such a change for very active code, as it can be changed ""on the go"" whenever a line is touched anyway.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9478#issuecomment-270880683,270880683,
kallewoof,2017-01-06T10:58:32Z,"I always thought PR's should be as ""pure"" as possible and not do anything extra. This is described in the contributor docs as well. That's what I have been aiming for so far. Each PR has one purpose and implements it with optimally minimal changes to the code base.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9478#issuecomment-270881092,270881092,
MarcoFalke,2017-01-06T11:10:39Z,"@kallewoof This is true and I tend to agree. Though, if you know the pain of merge conflicts, it seems less sensible to adhere to.\n\nYou might want to apply this change to places in the code that are usually touched very rarely (E.g. src/test, but NOT src/wallet). This will preempt similar pulls from popping up.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9478#issuecomment-270883159,270883159,
kallewoof,2017-01-06T11:14:07Z,"@MarcoFalke I hear you on merge conflict pain. It just seems like there's no real good option to move forward on things like these. \n\nRegarding src/test, you mean like cherry-picking https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9478/commits/bf59fbc82eec56d69b79adc413fa413dac987748 ? I can do that for sure. Presumably after 0.14 freeze like you mentioned?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9478#issuecomment-270883838,270883838,
