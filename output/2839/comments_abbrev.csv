mikehearn,2013-07-30T14:09:45Z,I was thinking it'd be better to allow tx hash blacklisting. To blacklist a block you'd blacklist its coinbase.\n\nTX blacklisting would allow app developers to more easily test double spend and reorg handling in regtest mode.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2839#issuecomment-21793211,21793211,
sipa,2013-07-30T14:21:04Z,"@mikehearn Makes sense, but that'd be more work, as there is no transaction index (and the optional one isn't used for validation). For blocks, there is already a mechanism for marking them invalid in the block index db.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2839#issuecomment-21794032,21794032,
mikehearn,2013-07-31T15:55:13Z,"Bitcoin already re-validates the last N hundred blocks on startup, right?

sipa,2013-08-01T14:00:28Z,"Not sure how that is related. This is not something that happens at startup - it can mark a block invalid during execution, and it will reorganize away from it instantly. If anything, this is very useful to test edge cases in the block connection logic.\n\nFor blacklisting transactions that are in the blockchain already, you'd need a transaction index anyway, and if you do, it's easy enough to loo",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2839#issuecomment-21938028,21938028,
gavinandresen,2013-08-05T09:29:33Z,Just to clarify: blacklistblock permanently blacklists a block; the only way to undo it is to -reindex the block chain.\n\nI think that should go in the blacklistblock help message; people might assume that the blacklist state is memory-only and can be reset by restarting.\n\nOtherwise: ACK.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2839#issuecomment-22095477,22095477,
