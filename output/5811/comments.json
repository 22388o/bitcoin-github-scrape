    "body": "I'm not directing a specific action there. My comment there was to point out that your changes were dangerous and you should probably reconsider your approach, and try to understand the root cause of the prior errors. Review cannot catch all errors, and if you continue to iterate against review and CI you will eventually get something that passes them but still may be broken.  E.g. You may want to consider breaking up your changes into smaller sets which are provably equivalent software (e.g. produce identical object code).\n\nWith respect to NDEBUG. It is not a supported build configuration at this time. There is specific code in the codebase to actively prevent compilation with NDEBUG set:\n'''\n#if defined(NDEBUG)\n#error \"Bitcoin cannot be compiled without assertions.\"\n#endif\n'''\n\nAssertions are not used for general debugging or error handling in the Bitcoin Core codebase. They are used to test critical invariants which are believed to always be true (on a non faulty compile, on not faulty hardware) where their undetected violation would likely result in a security vulnerability.  Historically they were sometimes used in ways in which the expression had side effects and would cause actual failure if removed. Although I believe I have removed all the uses side-effects the system has not been recently audited for them, and some could have been reintroduced (and I note, an overly aggressive avoidance of warnings is one of the things that can result in introducing side effects into assertion statements).\n\nThe commit that splits up a statement with NDEBUG ifdefs is not an approach we would be likely to accept, particularly not to silence an written but not read variable warning in an actively unsupported build configuration. On top of a general good practice avoidance of conditional compilation except where strictly needed for portability, performing a byte-saving line split is a messy approach which could lead to serious bugs in the future.\n",

    "body": "There was discussion on the NDBUG question above. I understand how it works. I've reverted it twice to try and satisfy maintainers. I realize it's a crappy fix to a crappy problem. We use a different approach in libbitcoin but I wanted to keep it simple/local here. I really don't care how or if it's resolved.\n\nThe consensus lib is presumably for developers. As I said at the outset, it should build cleanly (and not fail to build on major platforms). As a maintainer of one of the platforms that might use this build I've made a considerable effort to point out the issues. Given that these trivial changes are dangerous I will just suppress all warnings and move on.\n",
