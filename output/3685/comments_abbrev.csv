Diapolo,2014-02-19T07:25:44Z,"@laanwj How can I handle `connect(model, SIGNAL(numConnectionsChanged(int)), this, SLOT(setNumConnections(int)));`, when `setNumConnections()``no takes 2 ints (in and out)? I don't want to rewrite or add net (core) code for this.\n\nPerhaps just take `numConnectionsChanged()` as a trigger to query in/out?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3685#issuecomment-35472719,35472719,
laanwj,2014-02-19T07:36:09Z,"Oh crap the setNumConnections comes from core core? Of course. Ok, in that case, let's just keep it like this.\nPlease ignore my suggestions except for the int ClientModel::getNumConnections(bitfield enum) one.
