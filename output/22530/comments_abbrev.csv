jonatack,2021-07-27 17:02:43,"Thanks for the feedback.  As to the approach of automated versus manual sorting, I don't have a strong opinion.  In this context of an inexpensive operation not in a hotspot, on a project with many contributors, the avoidance of future maintainance + ""keep this manually sorted""-style documentation that automating the sort enables seems slightly more compelling to me, but either way seems fine.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22530#issuecomment-887679022,887679022,
