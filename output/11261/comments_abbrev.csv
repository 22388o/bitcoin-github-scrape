practicalswift,2017-09-06T23:13:23Z,"@laanwj In addition to the consistency argument you raised, it could be argued that we should try to avoid deprecated stuff in general :-)  The use of the `.h` form for C compatibility headers is deprecated in C++11. I'll add a note about it in the developer notes.\n\nTo make reviewing easy I made this change as a scripted-diff.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11261#issuecomment-327637233,327637233,

However, it would also require using all included functionality through the std namespace, since the non-legacy headers aren't guaranteed to contain it in the global namespace.\nIf you can get the bigger change accepted (prefixing included things with `std::` / adding the appropriate `using` declarations where needed) I would gladly support it.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11261#issuecomment-328483157,328483157,
