laanwj,2015-02-19T09:48:16Z,"Sorry to say but I'm not entirely convinced of adding mac-specific code to the core code. In the GUI this is more acceptable (and even there we like to avoid it if possible), but I don't know here. The plist-based solution works, so this reeks a bit of ""Don't fix it, it's not broken"" to me.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5804#issuecomment-75023292,75023292,
theuni,2015-02-19T16:47:13Z,"Ok. I was under the impression that some of our non-qt deps required objc and frameworks already, but looking at the link-line, that's not the case.

jonasschnelli,2015-03-05T10:43:01Z,"Hmm... i kinda liked this. Obj-c in core should be avoided, right. Maybe we find a more modular approach? `env_mac.mm`? I assume other OS will also come with/have similar low-energy technologies.\nRelated to #5314 and #5344\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5804#issuecomment-77342662,77342662,
