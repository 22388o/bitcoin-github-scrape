I.e. confusing `!a | b` as `!(a | b)` looks impossible to me, even if only due to the spacing.\n\nThe second example has only two operands, so you can't even read it wrong (unless you meant to include `?`, but the stuff following it are strings and not numbers).",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10527#issuecomment-306130369,306130369,
