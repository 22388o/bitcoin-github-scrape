sdaftuar,2016-06-03T00:11:35Z,@sipa  I think the right test would be to make sure that receiving a block with an overly long encoded varint doesn't cause the block to be marked permanently bad.  The test included here is overly prescriptive by requiring that the overly long encoding be rejected; we should just loosen that and still check that the normally encoded block be accepted.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8141#issuecomment-223458783,223458783,

sdaftuar,2016-06-10T19:53:42Z,"ACK\n\nI've looked through this test and the java test, and I believe this faithfully implements all the consensus tests from the java comparison tool that we run in travis.\n\nI think before we turn off running the java tool in travis, we should first do more careful experiments to make sure that the java tool wasn't catching things that this python test would miss, say by introducing intentional",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8141#issuecomment-225279631,225279631,
