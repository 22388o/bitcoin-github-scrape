        "patch": "@@ -146,6 +146,68 @@ HD wallets are incompatible with older versions of Bitcoin Core.\n \n [Pull request](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8035/files), [BIP 32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki)\n \n+Segregated Witness\n+------------------\n+\n+The code preparations for Segregated Witness (\"segwit\"), as described in [BIP\n+141](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0141.mediawiki), [BIP\n+143](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0143.mediawiki), [BIP\n+144](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0144.mediawiki), and [BIP\n+145](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0145.mediawiki) are\n+finished and included in this release.  However, BIP 141 does not yet specify\n+activation parameters on mainnet, and so this release does not support segwit\n+use on mainnet.  Testnet use is supported, and after BIP 141 is updated with\n+proposed parameters, a future release of Bitcoin Core is expected that\n+implements those parameters for mainnet.\n+\n+Furthermore, because segwit activation is not yet specified for mainnet,\n+version 0.13.0 will behave similarly as other pre-segwit releases even after a\n+future activation of BIP 141 on the network.  Upgrading from 0.13.0 will be\n+required in order to utilize segwit-related features on mainnet (such as signal\n+BIP 141 activation, mine segwit blocks, fully validate segwit blocks, relay\n+segwit blocks to other segwit nodes, and use segwit transactions in the\n+wallet, etc).\n+\n+Mining transaction selection (\"Child Pays For Parent\")\n+------------------------------------------------------\n+\n+The mining transaction selection algorithm has been replaced with an algorithm\n+that selects transactions based on their feerate inclusive of unconfirmed\n+ancestor transactions.  This means that a low-fee transaction can become more\n+likely to be selected if a high-fee transaction that spends its outputs is\n+relayed.\n+\n+With this change, the `-blockminsize` command line option has been removed.\n+\n+The command line option `-blockmaxsize` remains an option to specify the\n+maximum number of serialized bytes in a generated block.  In addition, the new\n+command line option `-blockmaxweight` has been added, which specifies the\n+maximum \"block weight\" of a generated block, as defined by [BIP 141 (Segregated\n+Witness)] (https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0141.mediawiki).\n+\n+In preparation for Segregated Witness, the mining algorithm has been modified\n+to optimize transaction selection for a given block weight, rather than a given\n+number of serialized bytes in a block.  In this release, transaction selection\n+is unaffected by this distinction (as BIP 141 activation is not supported on\n+mainnet in this release, see above), but in future releases and after BIP 141\n+activation, these calculations would be expected to differ.\n+\n+For optimal runtime performance, miners using this release should specify\n+`-blockmaxweight` on the command line, and not specify `-blockmaxsize`.\n+Additionally (or only) specifying `-blockmaxsize`, or relying on default\n+settings for both, may result in performance degradation, as the logic to\n+support `-blockmaxsize` performs additional computation to ensure that\n+constraint is met.  (Note that for mainnet, in this release, the equivalent\n+parameter for `-blockmaxweight` would be four times the desired\n+`-blockmaxsize`.  See [BIP 141]\n+(https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0141.mediawiki) for additional\n+details.)\n+\n+In the future, the `-blockmaxsize` option may be removed, as block creation is\n+no longer optimized for this metric.  Feedback is requested on whether to\n+deprecate or keep this command line option in future releases.\n+\n+\n Removal of internal miner\n --------------------------\n "
