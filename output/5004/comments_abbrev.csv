gavinandresen,2014-10-02T15:41:53Z,"I was confused by the use of the word ""Standard"" here when reviewing. Why the rename from Canonical to Standard? I think of ""standard"" pubkeys as the standard script forms that the wallet recognizes.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5004#discussion_r18347365,18347365,src/script/interpreter.cpp
sipa,2014-10-02T17:37:34Z,"'Canonical' seems to imply there is One Single Truth, but as several encoding rules get added through BIP62, that is no longer the case, so I want to get rid of that and have separate functions that check separate (and mostly independent) encoding rules. I agree 'standard' has the wrong meaning as well. I could go for 'IsCompressedOrUncompressedPubKey()' ?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5004#discussion_r18354309,18354309,src/script/interpreter.cpp
