All uses of \"feeler\" in our codebase referred to not just feeleres, but also \"test before evict conns\", which have different goals per [the paper](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity15/sec15-paper-heilman.pdf). I suggest that connections encompassing both features should not be called as one of those features, but rather should have its own name (\"probe\"). Otherwise, it's very easy to forget that \"feeler conns\" also do test-before-evict. And we actually had that mistake in the codebase (see the second commit)\r\n2. The second commit was dropped while I was figuring out travis issues, it's back now. See extra documentation, where the distinction between two features is clarified.",

You could, for example, add a note in a comment that it's referred to differently in the paper. Splitting the ConnTypes into more specific cases would also be acceptable, if it clarifies things.\r\n\r\nA wholesale search/replace over the source code is not the kind of change we usually merge. For example it causes conflicts with other PRs that make more significant changes.\r\n",

    "body": "I don't have a strong opinion on renaming feeler to probe. I just to provide some background on why I decided to reuse feeler connections for test-before-evict.\r\n\r\n1. Avoid additional locks or complexity by adding a thread or events for test-before-evict. I believe my original design required adding a lock and I was paranoid about causing deadlocks.\r\n\r\n2. I wanted a single place to rate limit \"helper\" connections and their buffers. A feeler connection can attempt to push something from new to tried which is might trigger test-before-evict probe connection. Having them share the same fixed size buffer limits the number of connections they both can make.\r\n\r\n3. Reduce the diff by not having separate mechanisms and variables for each case since they are basically doing the same thing. In some sense we just want a generic probe service that other features can use to probe addrs and to see if they are online.",
