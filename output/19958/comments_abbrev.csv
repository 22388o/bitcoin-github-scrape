All uses of ""feeler"" in our codebase referred to not just feeleres, but also ""test before evict conns"", which have different goals per [the paper](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity15/sec15-paper-heilman.pdf).

You could, for example, add a note in a comment that it's referred to differently in the paper. Splitting the ConnTypes into more specific cases would also be acceptable, if it clarifies things.\n\nA wholesale search/replace",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19958#issuecomment-694105891,694105891,

ariard,2020-09-17 22:47:51,I've already made the point elsewhere that it would be better to use `IsProbeConn()` here. We can't right now because type asserting methods are part of `CNode` not `ConnectionType` but maybe we could move them there and make `CConnman` a friend class ?
