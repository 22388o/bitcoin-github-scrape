I did not test it but I think with the current patch `formatServicesStr(NODE_NETWORK | NODE_WITNESS)` will return a string like `UNKNOWN[9] & UNKNOWN[9]`.\n\nThe arguments to `serviceFlagToStr()` are redundant (one can be derived from the other easily) which I think is confusing and could lead to slippages.
