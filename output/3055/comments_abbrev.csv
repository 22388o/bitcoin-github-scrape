wtogami,2013-10-11T00:09:50Z,The Icon change is fine.\n\nI would similarly suggest the full path for a distro package in order to guarantee that you are running the expected packaged binary instead of what may be installed elsewhere and earlier in $PATH.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3055#issuecomment-26102762,26102762,
sipa,2013-10-13T20:36:39Z,Agree with @laanwj and @wtogami. But perhaps these are more distro conventions than things we should be deciding?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3055#issuecomment-26226453,26226453,
wtogami,2013-10-13T21:06:42Z,"My earlier point is that it is awkward to have a distro packaging be reliant on what upstream is willing to include.  I would be in favor of complete removal of all distro-specific things.  There is a similar issue in the always out-of-date Ubuntu build instructions included in Bitcoin.

wtogami,2013-10-11T01:27:08Z,@gavinandresen For distro packaging Icon=name without extension seems to be the norm.  In general upstream projects probably shouldn't pay attention to the distro packaging much at all.  Note that the majority of distros don't bother submitting their packaging recipes to upstream projects.  There are just too many variations of distros.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3055#discussion_r6906214,6906214,contrib/debian/bitcoin-qt.desktop
