petertodd,2013-06-02T21:40:58Z,Thanks. The other thing to do is squash those two commits together - we don't like having excess commits in the tree without a good reason. If you aren't familiar with git look up the git-rebase command (specificially the -i interactive flag) for how to do this.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2728#issuecomment-18814501,18814501,
runeksvendsen,2013-06-03T10:18:50Z,Done. I _think_ I did it right. I messed up the rebase so I had to go back. But it looks right to me now.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2728#issuecomment-18832522,18832522,

runeksvendsen,2013-06-10T15:20:58Z,"After speaking to sipa on #bitcoin-dev I think it would be appropriate to add a warning to the readme about the consequences of using this script. Perhaps that it's advisable to only use this script with the -nolisten option, as you otherwise risk feeding someone the blockchain _really_ slowly.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2728#issuecomment-19205572,19205572,
