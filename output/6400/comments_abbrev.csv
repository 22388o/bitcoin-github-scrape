laanwj,2015-07-09T08:51:39Z,"> What about returning signed int -1 instead of float?\n\nAccording to the JSON standard, all numbers are created equal. So distinguishing between 'int' and 'float' on the client side is not robust.\n\nWhat I would suggest in clients to check for this error condition is `<0`. Negative value signifies an error, they should not check for an exact value.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6400#issuecomment-119878899,119878899,

I do not like the difference between -1.0 and -1.000000. It calls for bugs in other applications.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6400#issuecomment-119885286,119885286,
