laanwj,2017-07-06T14:29:12Z,"> Nit: We expect to find primitives/transaction.h locally in src/.\n\nutACK as it matches the common convention better.\n\nThough sometimes I wonder whether this convention is a good idea. `include <>` searches relative to the include paths, `include """"` relative to the directory of the current source file, then the include paths. We know `primitives/` is relative to the source root of the rep",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10752#issuecomment-313413021,313413021,
jtimon,2017-07-07T19:28:12Z,"The advantage of using #include ""primitives/transaction.h"" instead of simply #include ""transaction.h"" is that one day we may want to search and replace all  #include ""primitives/transaction.h"" say, to a new directory. If you moved primitives/block.o to the same directory at the same time it would be fine though. ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10752#issuecomment-313772073,313772073,
