laanwj,2016-02-02T11:26:47Z,"Welcome @kirkalx\n\nThe number of commits doesn't matter; better too many than too few, you can always use `git rebase -i` and force-push to squash commits together, if that results in clearer or more atomic changes. Separating them out is a bit more tricky.\n\nLooks good to me. utACK.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7458#issuecomment-178518852,178518852,
