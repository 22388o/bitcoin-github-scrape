The two being the same is just consequential. \n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8277#issuecomment-231254873,231254873,
laanwj,2016-07-08T06:23:40Z,"Tend to agree to keep this a separate function. In the long term we'd like the consensus critical data structures to be just data structures, with the bare minimum necessary for their interaction with consensus.\n\nNetwork-code-specific functionality does not belong in there.\n\nAs you need it for mempool syncing you could move it to some other non-consensus utility header.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8277#issuecomment-231284614,231284614,
