dooglus,2012-03-28T19:12:39Z,"Maybe.  I wanted to make the change as simple as possible for now, but could make it some multiplier of (or addition to) the log size.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1003#issuecomment-4780845,4780845,
dooglus,2012-03-28T20:30:39Z,"> Should that number be dynamically generated because the cache size can be changed?\n\nI added a couple of constants to db.h to define the in-memory log buffer size, and the max on-disk log file size, and used those in both places.  I don't think this is related to the cache size - did you mean the in-memory log buffer?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1003#issuecomment-4786341,4786341,
TheBlueMatt,2012-03-28T20:52:26Z,"Oh, Im sorry, I thought the max log size was set based on cli parameters now, didnt realize it was still constant.  Anyway, like the addition of the constants too...ACK\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1003#issuecomment-4787871,4787871,

dooglus,2012-03-29T17:36:18Z,Isn't it still a good idea to have the size in one place only rather than in two places?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1003#issuecomment-4826661,4826661,
