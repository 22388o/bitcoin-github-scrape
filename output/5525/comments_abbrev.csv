TheBlueMatt,2015-08-21T18:15:59Z,Needs rebase (again). Maybe needs a bit more of an interactive rebase because of the importaddress/importscript stuff related to the fundrawtransaction watch-only modifications. Sorry about that :/\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5525#issuecomment-133519426,133519426,
laanwj,2015-10-27T09:39:11Z,The rebase seems to be trivial.
