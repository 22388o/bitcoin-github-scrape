vasild,2020-04-09 09:45:53,nit: following the convention that `ID_foo` maps to `getfoo` this should be named `ID_BALANCES`.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18574#discussion_r406085847,406085847,src/bitcoin-cli.cpp
vasild,2020-04-09 09:54:17,"nit: Maybe a comment is warranted how come after generating 101 blocks the node's balance becomes 50.\n\n```suggestion\n# The block reward is 50 but it only matures after 100 (COINBASE_MATURITY) blocks,\n# so the node ""gets"" the reward for the first block as trusted 100 blocks later.\nBLOCKS = 101\nBALANCE = Decimal('50.00000000')\n```",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18574#discussion_r406090745,406090745,test/functional/interface_bitcoin_cli.py

This seems to be a standard convention in the tests, explained in test-shell.md, and used without documentation in wallet-basic.py and rpc_rawtransaction.py, among others... but I added a doc since it's generally better to do so.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18574#discussion_r406245985,406245985,test/functional/interface_bitcoin_cli.py
