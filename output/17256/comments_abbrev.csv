MarcoFalke,2019-10-25 21:07:31,"Yes, but the documentation serves also as a source for scripts. I think the hassle to ask everyone to change the line manually when copy-pasting into a script is too much to ask. I don't see the advantage of `apt` over `apt-get`.\n\nAlso, this conflicts with a bunch of other pull requests like #17165 (Remove BIP70 support by fanquake), which I'd rather not put into rebase hell again.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17256#issuecomment-546513881,546513881,

It's not bitcoin core's scope to teach people about what are user friendly commands to use, and `apt-get`works just as well (and isn't going to be deprecated).",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17256#issuecomment-546587009,546587009,
