jnewbery,2019-03-21T16:41:54Z,@laanwj @sdaftuar care to reACK? Should be harmless to merge this if you're happy with the comments.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15267#issuecomment-475308747,475308747,

laanwj,2019-01-31T09:59:43Z,`@note` maybe for doxygen?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15267#discussion_r252600956,252600956,src/coins.h
sdaftuar,2019-02-21T13:56:55Z,Not sure if we need this comment here given that we also have the comment at line 204 above?  I don't feel strongly though.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15267#discussion_r258936752,258936752,src/coins.h
sdaftuar,2019-02-21T13:58:41Z,"I don't believe that we should ever be pulling coins into the cache at this point in the code -- ATMP is designed so that we first pull the coins into the cache early in validation, and if we make it to this point in the code the coins should already be cached.\n\nA comment like this would make more sense at line 671 or so below.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15267#discussion_r258937481,258937481,src/validation.cpp
jnewbery,2019-02-22T15:33:59Z,"I suggest removing the last sentence 'This is used for DoS protection.' Without further context, it's not clear how this is used for DoS protection. Your new comment below gives that context and is easy to find (since ATMPW is only called in one place).",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15267#discussion_r259390930,259390930,src/validation.cpp
jnewbery,2019-02-22T15:35:24Z,I think it's ok to add this. Someone looking at the declaration of `FetchCoin` here might not look up to the comment next to the mutable members.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15267#discussion_r259391532,259391532,src/coins.h
jamesob,2019-02-22T16:07:39Z,"Ah right, good catch.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15267#discussion_r259405298,259405298,src/validation.cpp
jamesob,2019-02-22T16:20:18Z,Changed it to avoid mentioning DoS protection but instead articulate why the caller might make use of it.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15267#discussion_r259410336,259410336,src/validation.cpp
sdaftuar,2019-03-21T17:32:19Z,Technically this only adds `txin.prevout` to the cache if it’s not already there (hence the call above to `HaveCoinInCache`).  Perhaps rephrase to “... this call may add txin.prevout...” ?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15267#discussion_r267875818,267875818,src/validation.cpp
