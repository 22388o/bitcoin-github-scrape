morcos,2017-07-17T11:11:56Z,This PR has been changed to redefine dust and move the discard rate slightly lower.  See new PR description.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10817#issuecomment-315726955,315726955,
morcos,2017-07-17T11:56:31Z,"After discussion with @gmaxwell, just wanted to point out that the edge case rounding issues would only be with non-standard dust rates.  Since the default dust rate was 1000 sat/kB and the division in question was by 1000, then there are no rounding issues regardless of the output in question.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10817#issuecomment-315735198,315735198,
