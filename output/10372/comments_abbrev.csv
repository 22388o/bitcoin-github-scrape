TheBlueMatt,2017-05-22T20:02:48Z,Added a separate AddDataToRng function for general use later.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10372#issuecomment-303204811,303204811,

ryanofsky,2017-05-10T15:49:30Z,I don't think you actually need these casts.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10372#discussion_r115778800,115778800,src/random.cpp
ryanofsky,2017-05-10T15:50:00Z,Maybe move declaration up nearer to `RandAddSeed()`,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10372#discussion_r115778934,115778934,src/random.h
TheBlueMatt,2017-05-10T18:10:35Z,"Removed, I had just copied code from above.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10372#discussion_r115812809,115812809,src/random.cpp
TheBlueMatt,2017-05-10T18:11:41Z,I deliberately left it down by the GetStrongRandBytes instead of up by the RAND_add stuff. I'll let @sipa handle moving things around when he removes OpenSSL's rng.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10372#discussion_r115813035,115813035,src/random.h
laanwj,2017-05-17T08:59:30Z,"Would be nice to factor out the 'add this data to the random state' to a function, to make sure the same algorithm is used everywhere (e.g. to reduce the chance of accidental 'oops I replaced the state with all zeros' when there are more of these functions that add different entropy measurements).",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10372#discussion_r116946100,116946100,src/random.cpp
