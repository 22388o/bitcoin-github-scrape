    "body": "@jonatack , @amitiuttarwar Thanks a lot for the reviews! I addressed all comments above.\r\n\r\n> the commit message for [6041280](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/604128088ebf7ea0ce795c9683e32ee40daac7ed) says \"[test] Extract setting up addr message into a helper\", but it really extracts _sending_ addr message, with the previous commit extracting the set up. this was my fault, but I just noticed it now \r\n\r\nI changed the commit message and also added a note why mocktime is changed in this commit.\r\n \r\n> RE commit [6eb3024](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/6eb3024f142b88ac6cb73ea1ee28b60b7f2590ba) adding coverage for the ignore-first-message-from-outbound-peer: since this is the current behavior, it seems reasonable to add coverage (and thanks for adding the explanation), but just want to mention that I find this bitcoin core behavior super weird and think we should consider changing it. Either bitcoin core should be consistent with itself and propagate those initial self announcements, or it shouldn't self announce at all. From researching the addr behavior of alternative clients for #21528, I saw that a lot of nodes just do one early self-advertisement, so its unfortunate if bitcoin core nodes are just black-holing that as a side effect of getaddr logic. This is all out of scope of this PR but I'm mentioning since the test coverage highlights the behavior.\r\n\r\n I agree, the `fGetAddr` flag preventing this was initially meant to prevent relaying GETADDR responses - at some time the typical order of messages must have changed, and now it typically affects self-announcements. I discovered this unintended behavior during #19794, which would have removed it. \r\n\r\nI [closed](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19794#issuecomment-692916364) that PR and didn't open a follow-up as originally planned because after reading additional BIP155 discussion (especially [this](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/907#issuecomment-692894687) post by sipa) I realized that even addrs that are part extraordinarily small GETADDR responses <=10 wouldn't get relayed due to  the 10min recency limit anyway (and if they are recent enough, why not relay them?). The [suggestion](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19794#issuecomment-691184578) of keeping the flag around and making sure that it would apply to GETADDR responses again didn't really convince me anymore after that. (as opposed to just removing the flag and relying on the content of the addr messages themselves instead of timing)",
