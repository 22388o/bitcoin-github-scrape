laanwj,2018-10-31T17:47:58Z,"Makes sense.\nFor the sake of documentation simplicity I would be ok with mentioning python3 as simply one of the dependencies and not just for the tests. I think we do that for other platforms.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14617#issuecomment-434784194,434784194,
murrayn,2018-11-01T11:15:58Z,"@laanwj thanks for your input. I fully agree with you in general. For FreeBSD in particular, I think a sysadmin can decide whether installing Python 3 is worthwhile, rather than just adding another dependency. That was my thought process.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14617#issuecomment-435009731,435009731,
