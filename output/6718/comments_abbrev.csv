jonasschnelli,2015-09-24T14:17:03Z,I'm not sure if this is a good idea. Git and Github are two separate things. I agree with referencing a fix by `fixes #4321` placed in a _Github_ PR description or a _Github_ comment. Placing it in a _git commit_ is not required and not best practice IMO.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6718#discussion_r40323230,40323230,CONTRIBUTING.md
