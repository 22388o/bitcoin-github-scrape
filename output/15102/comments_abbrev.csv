ryanofsky,2019-01-04T16:50:10Z,"Not familiar with this test, but just reading the comment, it makes me wonder what outputs were previously in `badtx.vout`, and why they were generated to begin with if they can be discarded here. If it would make the hack slightly less hacky to avoid generating the outputs originally, or if there is a reason outputs just aren't important, it would be nice to state this in the comment.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15102#discussion_r245354728,245354728,test/functional/feature_block.py
