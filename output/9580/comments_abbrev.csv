laanwj,2017-01-26T09:21:04Z,"Concept ACK.\n\nBTW: Not necessarily in this pull, but if we're going to do active development on this script it would make sense to add a test. This does not necessarily need to be part of ""make check"" or Travis, but something that can be run separately and just does some automatic tests would make sense, I think.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9580#issuecomment-275341860,275341860,
droark,2017-01-27T04:39:05Z,"@laanwj - Good point. I'll create some tests. I'll rework this PR if I have time and submit a new PR if I don't. Any thoughts on where they should go? I feel like perhaps a ""test"" subfolder would be best. Putting them in qa/rpc-tests or src/test wouldn't really work. Maybe contrib/test could be created so that everything's in one place? I'm open to ideas.\n\nThanks.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9580#issuecomment-275587585,275587585,
laanwj,2017-01-27T09:14:26Z,"I'd say either putting the test script in `contrib/linearize` itself or creating a test subfolder in `contrib/linearize` appeals the most to me. A test directory under `contrib` would make less sense: the stuff in contrib is so far apart, that grouping things would be next to nonsensical.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9580#issuecomment-275620606,275620606,
droark,2017-01-27T15:17:44Z,@laanwj - Gotcha. I'll prepare some tests as time allows.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9580#issuecomment-275689152,275689152,
