    "body": "Just pushed a boatload of fixes. Sorry for yet another round of changes, but this has turned out to be much more complicated than originally anticipated. I can squash down before merge, but I decided to push individual changes in case anyone is following the progress.\n\nFully verified on osx now that my macbook is up and running again (yay!).\n\nI also scrapped the 'windows-deploy' target and replaced it with the generic 'deploy' one. 'make deploy' on osx will produce a fully-functional dmg. When building for windows, 'make deploy' will create a fully-functional win32 installer.\n\nAt this point, it's feeling very very solid. That said, I only have osx 10.6 at my disposal currently, so it hasn't been tested on 10.7/10.8 yet.\n\n@fanquake: Tested extensively with macports and homebrew after today's changes. The build procedure is pretty much: install macports/homebrew depends as before, but with automake/autoconf added. Additionally, you can install qt directly from macports/homebrew and it should just work (tm). After that, standard configure+make should be all it takes.\n\nI'll try to get the osx docs written+pushed tomorrow.\n",

    "body": "No worries. The reason I'm hesitant to do the docs is because it essentially needs a rm -f *. The point of autotools is abstraction, so there's really no need for platform-specific instructions. There's also really no need for distinction between qt/non-qt builds anymore.\n\nMy intention is essentially:\n- Platform-specific dependencies. A readme for each platform detailing what needs to be done before ./autogen.sh. Basically documenting the part you just went through.\n- Building bitcoin. How to bootstrap and configure. See ./configure --help for options. Pitfalls. What do I do when X?\n- Distribution notes. How to package, release, etc.\n- Testing. \n\nThe problem with the above is that I need a good bit of feedback. I've been looking at this (and working on other autotools projects) for so long that it's become hard to tell what's non-obvious. I don't think I'll receive much feedback until it's merged and there are more devs exposing its warts.\n\nSo my proposal is to do a quick readme with monkey-style copy/paste commands for the various platforms, and let that suffice until merge. Post-merge, the above outline could be much more easily worked out.\n\nThoughts?\n",

    "body": "I would propose low merge hurdles, namely\n- builds qt and daemon on at least one Linux OS\n- builds qt and daemon on at least one OSX version\n- builds qt and daemon on Windows, or has a clear path to doing so\n- pulltester\n\nAnything else can and should be resolved in-tree.  Once the system is working \"en grosse\" merge it, leaving sector experts and motivated parties to hammer out the final details.  In particular, Qt will likely need additional attention after merge, it sounds like.  That's OK.  We are not going to have 0.9-rc1 tomorrow or next week.\n\nThe first three seem to be well on their way to being completed.  The last is the toughie, IMO:  need to get our pulltester back in working order almost immediately after merge, so we need to beg BlueMatt for some time or hopefully grow some more pulltester experts (I am entirely hands-off Java, not being a fan of the language).\n\ntl;dr: Let's not endlessly iterate this outside of 'master'.  Merge it.\n",

I've add lcov support to the buildsystem, as well as support for the java test that pulltester runs (side-rant: I find it troubling when these things are out-of-tree and firmly believe that they should be testable by every dev). So Pulltester essentially becomes a few configure/make and that's it. \n\nI believe I can have that pushed up tonight.\n",

    "body": "Ok, that should do it for the pull tester. I've integrated lcov and the java test into the build. Also added a set of scripts for contrib that pull-tester can run from jenkins. The big benefit is that everything is now in-tree, so if they change in the future, there's no worry of getting out of sync with the build procedure. Additionally, devs can run the script and yield the same result as the bot.\n\n@TheBlueMatt ping. With any luck, the bot just needs to run test-scripts/pull-tester.sh . That in-turn kicks off https://github.com/theuni/bitcoin/blob/dd08a1146f5408af5316651fbd89027575bedf14/contrib/test-scripts/build-tests.sh.in, which is as close to the old behavior as I could get it.\n",
