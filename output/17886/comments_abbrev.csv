achow101,2020-01-07 04:13:38,Looks like it's probably because the `all_ts_files()` function in `update-translations.py` [explicitly ignores](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-maintainer-tools/blob/master/update-translations.py#L119) the `bitcoin_en.ts` file.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17886#issuecomment-571425286,571425286,
laanwj,2020-01-08 12:30:23,"This was definitely overlooked. These files are auto-generated by `update-translations.py`, which excludes the English translation. It shouldn't, for that purpose.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17886#issuecomment-572027500,572027500,
