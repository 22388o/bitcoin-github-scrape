This release seeks to\n-consensus enforce the rule.\n-\n-Bitcoin transactions currently may specify a locktime indicating when\n-they may be added to a valid block.  Current consensus rules require\n-that blocks have a block header time greater than the locktime specified\n-in any transaction in that block.\n-\n-Miners get to choose what time they use for their header time, with the\n-consensus rule being that no node will accept a block whose time is more\n-than two hours in the future.  This creates a incentive for miners to\n-set their header times to future values in order to include locktimed\n-transactions which weren't supposed to be included for up to two more\n-hours.\n-\n-The consensus rules also specify that valid blocks may have a header\n-time greater than that of the median of the 11 previous blocks.  This\n-GetMedianTimePast() time has a key feature we generally associate with\n-time: it can't go backwards.\n-\n-[BIP113][] specifies a soft fork enforced in this release that\n-weakens this perverse incentive for individual miners to use a future\n-time by requiring that valid blocks have a computed GetMedianTimePast()\n-greater than the locktime specified in any transaction in that block.\n-\n-Mempool inclusion rules currently require transactions to be valid for\n-immediate inclusion in a block in order to be accepted into the mempool.\n-This release begins applying the BIP113 rule to received transactions,\n-so transaction whose time is greater than the GetMedianTimePast() will\n-no longer be accepted into the mempool.\n-\n-**Implication for miners:** you will begin rejecting transactions that\n-would not be valid under BIP113, which will prevent you from producing\n-invalid blocks when BIP113 is enforced on the network. Any\n-transactions which are valid under the current rules but not yet valid\n-under the BIP113 rules will either be mined by other miners or delayed\n-until they are valid under BIP113. Note, however, that time-based\n-locktime transactions are more or less unseen on the network currently.\n-\n-**Implication for users:** GetMedianTimePast() always trails behind the\n-current time, so a transaction locktime set to the present time will be\n-rejected by nodes running this release until the median time moves\n-forward. To compensate, subtract one hour (3,600 seconds) from your\n-locktimes to allow those transactions to be included in mempools at\n-approximately the expected time.\n-\n-For more information about the implementation, see\n-<https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6566>\n-\n-Miscellaneous\n--------------\n-\n-The p2p alert system is off by default.

Wait until it has completely\n+shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the\n+installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on Mac) or\n+bitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux).\n+\n+Downgrade warning\n+-----------------\n+\n+### Downgrade to a version < 0.10.0\n+\n+Because release 0.10.0 and later makes use of headers-first synchronization and\n+parallel block download (see further), the block files and databases are not\n+backwards-compatible with pre-0.10 versions of Bitcoin Core or other software:\n+\n+* Blocks will be stored on disk out of order (in the order they are\n+received, really), which makes it incompatible with some tools or\n+other programs. Reindexing using earlier versions will also not work\n+anymore as a result of this.\n+\n+* The block index database will now hold headers for which no block is\n+stored on disk, which earlier versions won't support.\n+\n+If you want to be able to downgrade smoothly, make a backup of your entire data\n+directory. Without this your node will need start syncing (or importing from\n+bootstrap.dat) anew afterwards. It is possible that the data from a completely\n+synchronised 0.10 node may be usable in older versions as-is, but this is not\n+supported and may break as soon as the older version attempts to reindex.\n+\n+This does not affect wallet forward or backward compatibility.\n+\n+### Downgrade to a version < 0.12.0\n+\n+Because release 0.12.0 and later will obfuscate the chainstate on every\n+fresh sync or reindex, the chainstate is not backwards-compatible with\n+pre-0.12 versions of Bitcoin Core or other software.\n+\n+If you want to downgrade after you have done a reindex with 0.12.0 or later,\n+you will need to reindex when you first start Bitcoin Core version 0.11 or\n+earlier.\n+\n+Notable changes\n+===============\n+\n+Signature validation using libsecp256k1\n+---------------------------------------\n+\n+ECDSA signatures inside Bitcoin transactions now use validation using\n+[libsecp256k1](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1) instead of OpenSSL.\n+\n+Depending on the platform, this means a significant speedup for raw signature\n+validation speed. The advantage is largest on x86_64, where validation is over\n+five times faster. In practice, this translates to a raw reindexing and new\n+block validation times that are less than half of what it was before.\n+\n+Libsecp256k1 has undergone very extensive testing and validation.\n+\n+A side effect of this change is that libconsensus no longer depends on OpenSSL.\n+\n+Reduce upload traffic\n+---------------------\n+\n+A major part of the outbound traffic is caused by serving historic blocks to\n+other nodes in initial block download state.\n+\n+It is now possible to reduce the total upload traffic via the `-maxuploadtarget`\n+parameter. This is *not* a hard limit but a threshold to minimize the outbound\n+traffic. When the limit is about to be reached, the uploaded data is cut by not\n+serving historic blocks (blocks older than one week).\n+Moreover, any SPV peer is disconnected when they request a filtered block.\n+\n+This option can be specified in MiB per day and is turned off by default\n+(`-maxuploadtarget=0`).\n+The recommended minimum is 144 * MAX_BLOCK_SIZE (currently 144MB) per day.\n+\n+Whitelisted peers will never be disconnected, although their traffic counts for\n+calculating the target.\n+\n+A more detailed documentation about keeping traffic low can be found in\n+[/doc/reduce-traffic.md](/doc/reduce-traffic.md).\n+\n+Direct headers announcement (BIP 130)\n+-------------------------------------\n+\n+Between compatible peers, [BIP 130]\n+(https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0130.mediawiki)\n+direct headers announcement is used. This means that blocks are advertised by\n+announcing their headers directly, instead of just announcing the hash. In a\n+reorganization, all new headers are sent, instead of just the new tip. This\n+can often prevent an extra roundtrip before the actual block is downloaded.\n+\n+With this change, pruning nodes are now able to relay new blocks to compatible\n+peers.\n+\n+Memory pool limiting\n+--------------------\n+\n+Previous versions of Bitcoin Core had their mempool limited by checking\n+a transaction's fees against the node's minimum relay fee. There was no\n+upper bound on the size of the mempool and attackers could send a large\n+number of transactions paying just slighly more than the default minimum\n+relay fee to crash nodes with relatively low RAM. A temporary workaround\n+for previous versions of Bitcoin Core was to raise the default minimum\n+relay fee.\n+\n+Bitcoin Core 0.12 will have a strict maximum size on the mempool. The\n+default value is 300 MB and can be configured with the `-maxmempool`\n+parameter. Whenever a transaction would cause the mempool to exceed\n+its maximum size, the transaction that (along with in-mempool descendants) has\n+the lowest total feerate (as a package) will be evicted and the node's effective\n+minimum relay feerate will be increased to match this feerate plus the initial\n+minimum relay feerate. The initial minimum relay feerate is set to\n+1000 satoshis per kB.\n+\n+Bitcoin Core 0.12 also introduces new default policy limits on the length and\n+size of unconfirmed transaction chains that are allowed in the mempool\n+(generally limiting the length of unconfirmed chains to 25 transactions, with a\n+total size of 101 KB).  These limits can be overriden using command line\n+arguments; see the extended help (`--help -help-debug`) for more information.\n+\n+Opt-in Replace-by-fee transactions\n+----------------------------------\n+\n+It is now possible to replace transactions in the transaction memory pool of\n+Bitcoin Core 0.12 nodes. Bitcoin Core will only allow replacement of\n+transactions which have any of their inputs' `nSequence` number set to less\n+than `0xffffffff - 1`.  Moreover, a replacement transaction may only be\n+accepted when it pays sufficient fee, as described in [BIP 125]\n+(https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0125.mediawiki).\n+\n+Transaction replacement can be disabled with a new command line option,\n+`-mempoolreplacement=0`.  Transactions signaling replacement under BIP125 will\n+still be allowed into the mempool in this configuration, but replacements will\n+be rejected.  This option is intended for miners who want to continue the\n+transaction selection behavior of previous releases.\n+\n+The `-mempoolreplacement` option is *not recommended* for wallet users seeking\n+to avoid receipt of unconfirmed opt-in transactions, because this option does\n+not prevent transactions which are replaceable under BIP 125 from being accepted\n+(only subsequent replacements, which other nodes on the network that implement\n+BIP 125 are likely to relay and mine).  Wallet users wishing to detect whether\n+a transaction is subject to replacement under BIP 125 should instead use the\n+updated RPC calls `gettransaction` and `listtransactions`, which now have an\n+additional field in the output indicating if a transaction is replaceable under\n+BIP125 (\"bip125-replaceable\").\n+\n+Note that the wallet in Bitcoin Core 0.12 does not yet have support for\n+creating transactions that would be replaceable under BIP 125.\n+\n+\n+RPC: Random-cookie RPC authentication\n+-------------------------------------\n+\n+When no `-rpcpassword` is specified, the daemon now uses a special 'cookie'\n+file for authentication. This file is generated with random content when the\n+daemon starts, and deleted when it exits. Its contents are used as\n+authentication token. Read access to this file controls who can access through\n+RPC. By default it is stored in the data directory but its location can be\n+overridden with the option `-rpccookiefile`.\n+\n+This is similar to Tor's CookieAuthentication: see\n+https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html.en\n+\n+This allows running bitcoind without having to do any manual configuration.\n+\n+Relay: Any sequence of pushdatas in OP_RETURN outputs now allowed\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------\n+\n+Previously OP_RETURN outputs with a payload were only relayed and mined if they\n+had a single pushdata. This restriction has been lifted to allow any\n+combination of data pushes and numeric constant opcodes (OP_1 to OP_16) after\n+the OP_RETURN. The limit on OP_RETURN output size is now applied to the entire\n+serialized scriptPubKey, 83 bytes by default. (the previous 80 byte default plus\n+three bytes overhead)\n+\n+Relay and Mining: Priority transactions\n+---------------------------------------\n+\n+Bitcoin Core has a heuristic 'priority' based on coin value and age. This\n+calculation is used for relaying of transactions which do not pay the\n+minimum relay fee, and can be used as an alternative way of sorting\n+transactions for mined blocks. Bitcoin Core will relay transactions with\n+insufficient fees depending on the setting of `-limitfreerelay=<r>` (default:\n+`r=15` kB per minute) and `-blockprioritysize=<s>`.\n+\n+In Bitcoin Core 0.12, when mempool limit has been reached a higher minimum\n+relay fee takes effect to limit memory usage. Transactions which do not meet\n+this higher effective minimum relay fee will not be relayed or mined even if\n+they rank highly according to the priority heuristic.\n+\n+The mining of transactions based on their priority is also now disabled by\n+default. To re-enable it, simply set `-blockprioritysize=<n>` where is the size\n+in bytes of your blocks to reserve for these transactions. The old default was\n+50k, so to retain approximately the same policy, you would set\n+`-blockprioritysize=50000`.\n+\n+Additionally, as a result of computational simplifications, the priority value\n+used for transactions received with unconfirmed inputs is lower than in prior\n+versions due to avoiding recomputing the amounts as input transactions confirm.\n+\n+External miner policy set via the `prioritisetransaction` RPC to rank\n+transactions already in the mempool continues to work as it has previously.\n+Note, however, that if mining priority transactions is left disabled, the\n+priority delta will be ignored and only the fee metric will be effective.\n+\n+This internal automatic prioritization handling is being considered for removal\n+entirely in Bitcoin Core 0.13, and it is at this time undecided whether the\n+more accurate priority calculation for chained unconfirmed transactions will be\n+restored. Community direction on this topic is particularly requested to help\n+set project priorities.\n+\n+Automatically use Tor hidden services\n+-------------------------------------\n+\n+Starting with Tor version 0.2.7.1 it is possible, through Tor's control socket\n+API, to create and destroy 'ephemeral' hidden services programmatically.\n+Bitcoin Core has been updated to make use of this.\n+\n+This means that if Tor is running (and proper authorization is available),\n+Bitcoin Core automatically creates a hidden service to listen on, without\n+manual configuration. Bitcoin Core will also use Tor automatically to connect\n+to other .onion nodes if the control socket can be successfully opened. This\n+will positively affect the number of available .onion nodes and their usage.\n+\n+This new feature is enabled by default if Bitcoin Core is listening, and\n+a connection to Tor can be made. It can be configured with the `-listenonion`,\n+`-torcontrol` and `-torpassword` settings. To show verbose debugging\n+information, pass `-debug=tor`.\n+\n+Notifications through ZMQ\n+-------------------------\n+\n+Bitcoind can now (optionally) asynchronously notify clients through a\n+ZMQ-based PUB socket of the arrival of new transactions and blocks.\n+This feature requires installation of the ZMQ C API library 4.x and\n+configuring its use through the command line or configuration file.\n+Please see [docs/zmq.md](/doc/zmq.md) for details of operation.\n+\n+Wallet: Transaction fees\n+------------------------\n+\n+Various improvements have been made to how the wallet calculates\n+transaction fees.\n+\n+Users can decide to pay a predefined fee rate by setting `-paytxfee=<n>`\n+(or `settxfee <n>` rpc during runtime). A value of `n=0` signals Bitcoin\n+Core to use floating fees. By default, Bitcoin Core will use floating\n+fees.\n+\n+Based on past transaction data, floating fees approximate the fees\n+required to get into the `m`th block from now. This is configurable\n+with `-txconfirmtarget=<m>` (default: `2`).\n+\n+Sometimes, it is not possible to give good estimates, or an estimate\n+at all. Therefore, a fallback value can be set with `-fallbackfee=<f>`\n+(default: `0.0002` BTC/kB).\n+\n+At all times, Bitcoin Core will cap fees at `-maxtxfee=<x>` (default:\n+0.10) BTC.\n+Furthermore, Bitcoin Core will never create transactions paying less than\n+the current minimum relay fee.\n+Finally, a user can set the minimum fee rate for all transactions with\n+`-mintxfee=<i>`, which defaults to 1000 satoshis per kB.\n+\n+Wallet: Negative confirmations and conflict detection\n+-----------------------------------------------------\n+\n+The wallet will now report a negative number for confirmations that indicates\n+how deep in the block chain the conflict is found. For example, if a transaction\n+A has 5 confirmations and spends the same input as a wallet transaction B, B\n+will be reported as having -5 confirmations. If another wallet transaction C\n+spends an output from B, it will also be reported as having -5 confirmations.\n+To detect conflicts with historical transactions in the chain a one-time\n+`-rescan` may be needed.\n+\n+Unlike earlier versions, unconfirmed but non-conflicting transactions will never\n+get a negative confirmation count. They are not treated as spendable unless\n+they're coming from ourself (change) and accepted into our local mempool,\n+however. The new \"trusted\" field in the `listtransactions` RPC output\n+indicates whether outputs of an unconfirmed transaction are considered\n+spendable.\n+\n+Wallet: Merkle branches removed\n+-------------------------------\n+\n+Previously, every wallet transaction stored a Merkle branch to prove its\n+presence in blocks. This wasn't being used for more than an expensive\n+sanity check. Since 0.12, these are no longer stored. When loading a\n+0.12 wallet into an older version, it will automatically rescan to avoid\n+failed checks.\n+\n+Wallet: Pruning\n+---------------\n+\n+With 0.12 it is possible to use wallet functionality in pruned mode.\n+This can reduce the disk usage from currently around 60 GB to\n+around 2 GB.\n+\n+However, rescans as well as the RPCs `importwallet`, `importaddress`,\n+`importprivkey` are disabled.\n+\n+To enable block pruning set `prune=<N>` on the command line or in\n+`bitcoin.conf`, where `N` is the number of MiB to allot for\n+raw block & undo data.\n+\n+A value of 0 disables pruning. The minimal value above 0 is 550. Your\n+wallet is as secure with high values as it is with low ones. Higher\n+values merely ensure that your node will not shut down upon blockchain\n+reorganizations of more than 2 days - which are unlikely to happen in\n+practice. In future releases, a higher value may also help the network\n+as a whole: stored blocks could be served to other nodes.\n+\n+For further information about pruning, you may also consult the [release\n+notes of v0.11.0](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v0.11.0/doc/release-notes.md#block-file-pruning).\n+\n+`NODE_BLOOM` service bit\n+------------------------\n+\n+Support for the `NODE_BLOOM` service bit, as described in [BIP\n+111](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0111.mediawiki), has been\n+added to the P2P protocol code.\n+\n+BIP 111 defines a service bit to allow peers to advertise that they support\n+bloom filters (such as used by SPV clients) explicitly. It also bumps the protocol\n+version to allow peers to identify old nodes which allow bloom filtering of the\n+connection despite lacking the new service bit.\n+\n+In this version, it is only enforced for peers that send protocol versions\n+`>=70011`. For the next major version it is planned that this restriction will be\n+removed. It is recommended to update SPV clients to check for the `NODE_BLOOM`\n+service bit for nodes that report versions newer than 70011.\n+\n+Option parsing behavior\n+-----------------------\n+\n+Command line options are now parsed strictly in the order in which they are\n+specified. It used to be the case that `-X -noX` ends up, unintuitively, with X\n+set, as `-X` had precedence over `-noX`. This is no longer the case. Like for\n+other software, the last specified value for an option will hold.\n+\n+RPC: Low-level API changes\n+--------------------------\n+\n+- Monetary amounts can be provided as strings. This means that for example the\n+  argument to sendtoaddress can be \"0.0001\" instead of 0.0001. This can be an\n+  advantage if a JSON library insists on using a lossy floating point type for\n+  numbers, which would be dangerous for monetary amounts.\n+\n+* The `asm` property of each scriptSig now contains the decoded signature hash\n+  type for each signature that provides a valid defined hash type.\n+\n+* OP_NOP2 has been renamed to OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY by [BIP 65](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0065.mediawiki)\n+\n+The following items contain assembly representations of scriptSig signatures\n+and are affected by this change:\n+\n+- RPC `getrawtransaction`\n+- RPC `decoderawtransaction`\n+- RPC `decodescript`\n+- REST `/rest/tx/` (JSON format)\n+- REST `/rest/block/` (JSON format when including extended tx details)\n+- `bitcoin-tx -json`\n+\n+For example, the `scriptSig.asm` property of a transaction input that\n+previously showed an assembly representation of:\n+\n+    304502207fa7a6d1e0ee81132a269ad84e68d695483745cde8b541e3bf630749894e342a022100c1f7ab20e13e22fb95281a870f3dcf38d782e53023ee313d741ad0cfbc0c509001 400000 OP_NOP2\n+\n+now shows as:\n+\n+    304502207fa7a6d1e0ee81132a269ad84e68d695483745cde8b541e3bf630749894e342a022100c1f7ab20e13e22fb95281a870f3dcf38d782e53023ee313d741ad0cfbc0c5090[ALL] 400000 OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY\n+\n+Note that the output of the RPC `decodescript` did not change because it is\n+configured specifically to process scriptPubKey and not scriptSig scripts.\n+\n+RPC: SSL support dropped\n+------------------------\n+\n+SSL support for RPC, previously enabled by the option `rpcssl` has been dropped\n+from both the client and the server. This was done in preparation for removing\n+the dependency on OpenSSL for the daemon completely.\n+\n+Trying to use `rpcssl` will result in an error:\n+\n+    Error: SSL mode for RPC (-rpcssl) is no longer supported.\n+\n+If you are one of the few people that relies on this feature, a flexible\n+migration path is to use `stunnel`. This is an utility that can tunnel\n+arbitrary TCP connections inside SSL. On e.g. Ubuntu it can be installed with:\n+\n+    sudo apt-get install stunnel4\n+\n+Then, to tunnel a SSL connection on 28332 to a RPC server bound on localhost on port 18332 do:\n+\n+    stunnel -d 28332 -r 127.0.0.1:18332 -p stunnel.pem -P ''\n+\n+It can also be set up system-wide in inetd style.\n+\n+Another way to re-attain SSL would be to setup a httpd reverse proxy. This solution\n+would allow the use of different authentication, loadbalancing, on-the-fly compression and\n+caching. A sample config for apache2 could look like:\n+\n+    Listen 443\n+\n+    NameVirtualHost *:443\n+    <VirtualHost *:443>\n+\n+    SSLEngine On\n+    SSLCertificateFile /etc/apache2/ssl/server.crt\n+    SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/apache2/ssl/server.key\n+\n+    <Location /bitcoinrpc>\n+        ProxyPass http://127.0.0.1:8332/\n+        ProxyPassReverse http://127.0.0.1:8332/\n+        # optional enable digest auth\n+        # AuthType Digest\n+        # ...\n+\n+        # optional bypass bitcoind rpc basic auth\n+        # RequestHeader set Authorization \"Basic <hash>\"\n+        # get the <hash> from the shell with: base64 <<< bitcoinrpc:<password>\n+    </Location>\n+\n+    # Or, balance the load:\n+    # ProxyPass / balancer://balancer_cluster_name\n+\n+    </VirtualHost>\n+\n+Mining Code Changes\n+-------------------\n+\n+The mining code in 0.12 has been optimized to be significantly faster and use less\n+memory. As part of these changes, consensus critical calculations are cached on a\n+transaction's acceptance into the mempool and the mining code now relies on the\n+consistency of the mempool to assemble blocks. However all blocks are still tested\n+for validity after assembly.\n+\n+Other P2P Changes\n+-----------------\n+\n+The list of banned peers is now stored on disk rather than in memory.\n+Restarting bitcoind will no longer clear out the list of banned peers; instead\n+a new RPC call (`clearbanned`) can be used to manually clear the list.  The new\n+`setban` RPC call can also be used to manually ban or unban a peer.\n+\n+0.12.0 Change log\n+=================\n+\n+Detailed release notes follow. This overview includes changes that affect\n+behavior, not code moves, refactors and string updates.

Wait until it has completely\n+shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the\n+installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on Mac) or\n+bitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux).\n+\n+Downgrade warning\n+-----------------\n+\n+### Downgrade to a version < 0.12.0\n+\n+Because release 0.12.0 and later will obfuscate the chainstate on every\n+fresh sync or reindex, the chainstate is not backwards-compatible with\n+pre-0.12 versions of Bitcoin Core or other software.\n+\n+If you want to downgrade after you have done a reindex with 0.12.0 or later,\n+you will need to reindex when you first start Bitcoin Core version 0.11 or\n+earlier.\n+\n+Notable changes\n+===============\n+\n+First version bits BIP9 softfork deployment\n+-------------------------------------------\n+\n+This release includes a soft fork deployment to enforce [BIP68][],\n+[BIP112][] and [BIP113][] using the [BIP9][] deployment mechanism.\n+\n+The deployment sets the block version number to 0x20000001 between\n+midnight 1st May 2016 and midnight 1st May 2017 to signal readiness for \n+deployment. The version number consists of 0x20000000 to indicate version\n+bits together with setting bit 0 to indicate support for this combined\n+deployment, shown as \"csv\" in the `getblockchaininfo` RPC call.\n+\n+For more information about the soft forking change, please see\n+<https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7648>\n+\n+This specific backport pull-request can be viewed at\n+<https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7543>\n+\n+[BIP9]: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0009.mediawiki\n+[BIP68]: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0068.mediawiki\n+[BIP112]: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0112.mediawiki\n+[BIP113]: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0113.mediawiki\n+\n+BIP68 soft fork to enforce sequence locks for relative locktime\n+---------------------------------------------------------------\n+\n+[BIP68][] introduces relative lock-time consensus-enforced semantics of\n+the sequence number field to enable a signed transaction input to remain\n+invalid for a defined period of time after confirmation of its corresponding\n+outpoint.\n+\n+For more information about the implementation, see\n+<https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7184>\n+\n+BIP112 soft fork to enforce OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY\n+--------------------------------------------------\n+\n+[BIP112][] redefines the existing OP_NOP3 as OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY (CSV)\n+for a new opcode in the Bitcoin scripting system that in combination with\n+[BIP68][] allows execution pathways of a script to be restricted based\n+on the age of the output being spent.\n+\n+For more information about the implementation, see\n+<https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7524>\n+\n+BIP113 locktime enforcement soft fork\n+-------------------------------------\n+\n+Bitcoin Core 0.11.2 previously introduced mempool-only locktime\n+enforcement using GetMedianTimePast(). This release seeks to\n+consensus enforce the rule.\n+\n+Bitcoin transactions currently may specify a locktime indicating when\n+they may be added to a valid block.  Current consensus rules require\n+that blocks have a block header time greater than the locktime specified\n+in any transaction in that block.\n+\n+Miners get to choose what time they use for their header time, with the\n+consensus rule being that no node will accept a block whose time is more\n+than two hours in the future.  This creates a incentive for miners to\n+set their header times to future values in order to include locktimed\n+transactions which weren't supposed to be included for up to two more\n+hours.\n+\n+The consensus rules also specify that valid blocks may have a header\n+time greater than that of the median of the 11 previous blocks.  This\n+GetMedianTimePast() time has a key feature we generally associate with\n+time: it can't go backwards.\n+\n+[BIP113][] specifies a soft fork enforced in this release that\n+weakens this perverse incentive for individual miners to use a future\n+time by requiring that valid blocks have a computed GetMedianTimePast()\n+greater than the locktime specified in any transaction in that block.\n+\n+Mempool inclusion rules currently require transactions to be valid for\n+immediate inclusion in a block in order to be accepted into the mempool.\n+This release begins applying the BIP113 rule to received transactions,\n+so transaction whose time is greater than the GetMedianTimePast() will\n+no longer be accepted into the mempool.\n+\n+**Implication for miners:** you will begin rejecting transactions that\n+would not be valid under BIP113, which will prevent you from producing\n+invalid blocks when BIP113 is enforced on the network. Any\n+transactions which are valid under the current rules but not yet valid\n+under the BIP113 rules will either be mined by other miners or delayed\n+until they are valid under BIP113. Note, however, that time-based\n+locktime transactions are more or less unseen on the network currently.\n+\n+**Implication for users:** GetMedianTimePast() always trails behind the\n+current time, so a transaction locktime set to the present time will be\n+rejected by nodes running this release until the median time moves\n+forward. To compensate, subtract one hour (3,600 seconds) from your\n+locktimes to allow those transactions to be included in mempools at\n+approximately the expected time.\n+\n+For more information about the implementation, see\n+<https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6566>\n+\n+Miscellaneous\n+-------------\n+\n+The p2p alert system is off by default.
