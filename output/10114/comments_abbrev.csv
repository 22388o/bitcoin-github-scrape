We've caught our first fish.\n\nI've pushed a commit that changes p2p-compactblock to use a new method send_await_disconnect(), which awaits a disconnect rather than a pong. \n\nThe commit adds the method to p2p-compactblocks.py, but a future commit could move it to mininode since it could be useful more generally. The commit reduces the p2p-compactblock runtime by 30 seconds.\n\nI'",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10114#issuecomment-290179869,290179869,
