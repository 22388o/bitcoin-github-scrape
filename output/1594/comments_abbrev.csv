laanwj,2012-07-18T19:54:11Z,"If it ought to be fixed, it is on a deeper level than the ui, and not by\nspecial casing the testnet. Remember that the testnet is there to test how\nthe client behaves in circumstances that are possible but unlikely on the\nmain net. Special casing for testnet could effectively cover up problems.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1594#issuecomment-7080006,7080006,
Diapolo,2012-07-19T20:55:55Z,@laanwj I had a talk with sipa about the underlying issue a few days ago and you are right of course. That's why the testnet3 casing is gone from this pull ;).\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1594#issuecomment-7115036,7115036,
