achow101,2019-03-14T19:28:59Z,"NACK. I don't think that any imported private keys should be added to the keypool. A key that has been imported is one which has been exposed in plaintext and should thus be considered compromised. It would be unsafe to continue to use such a private key.

The only time I think it really makes sense to import private keys are restoring a wallet backup, converting a foreign wallet, or vanitygen. The latter case definitely could benefit from adding to the keypool: someone could leave a vanitygen process constantly filling the",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15414#issuecomment-483981639,483981639,
