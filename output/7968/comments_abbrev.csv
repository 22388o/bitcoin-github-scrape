wtogami,2016-05-02T16:57:04Z,"OK, so you want removal of stuff from doc/README.md, will do.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7968#issuecomment-216291849,216291849,
laanwj,2016-05-04T09:39:53Z,"Yes, either you should remove it or leave it alone (to be cleaned up by someone else). Extending it at least makes no sense.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7968#issuecomment-216812310,216812310,
wtogami,2016-05-04T18:58:25Z,Force pushed to update only the build requirements.  doc/README.md should be cleaned up separately.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7968#issuecomment-216966677,216966677,
laanwj,2016-05-02T11:30:08Z,"Interesting. Good catch - this hasn't been true for a while. We now link qt statically on Linux, so there is no actual need to install any run-time library. \nBuilding is explained in `build-unix.md` so this part can go entirely (as this is targeted at people installing the binaries).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7968#discussion_r61727978,61727978,doc/README.md

wtogami,2016-05-06T01:08:44Z,"You're technically correct, just it's never listed in any build requirements because it's assumed to be in the minimum build requirements of anything in Fedora.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7968#discussion_r62278435,62278435,doc/build-unix.md
