Diapolo,2012-09-24T21:10:48Z,"itostr() does `strprintf(""%d"", n)`, which is for signed integers, so should we better use `strprintf(""%u"", GetDefaultRPCPort())` instead, as we have an unsigned short as port number?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1862#discussion_r1677922,1677922,src/bitcoinrpc.cpp
kjj2,2012-09-24T23:49:15Z,"My understanding is that this is well defined.  The implicit type conversion is from unsigned short to signed int, which is always safe.  (Since the short is unsigned, there is no sign to extend.)  The compiler doesn't even blink at this with -Wall, but it does gripe often about the 3 lines in net.h that assign a literal -1 to an unsigned int.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1862#discussion_r1679137,1679137,src/bitcoinrpc.cpp

kjj2,2012-09-25T05:12:20Z,"net.h, lines 219, 353, 388.  All three lines have nMessageStart = -1; but nMessageStart is unsigned int from line 167.  There are other warnings that pop up when I compile, but net.h seems to be in just about everything, so I see them over and over again when I build.  Does your compiler not warn on them?  Mine is a bit old.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1862#discussion_r1680609,1680609,src/bitcoinrpc.cpp
laanwj,2012-09-25T08:46:54Z,"No problem here, it is entirely correct: calling itostr casts the unsigned short to a signed integer (which is larger, so there is never undefined behavior), before feeding it into strprintf as a signed integer (%d).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1862#discussion_r1681635,1681635,src/bitcoinrpc.cpp
Diapolo,2012-09-25T09:15:35Z,"@kjj2 OT on net.h: AFAIK -1 for an unsigned var means set all bits, which should be correct. I'm not sure if it is intended, but valid ^^. Oh and my compiler doesn't warn there (GCC 4.7.0).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1862#discussion_r1681836,1681836,src/bitcoinrpc.cpp
laanwj,2012-09-25T09:42:34Z,"You could also use `~0` to specify ""set all bits"". It's less controversial. Though I think (unsigned) -1 is correct. Overflow when converting from signed to unsigned never results in undefined behavior, don't try it the other way, though...\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1862#discussion_r1682030,1682030,src/bitcoinrpc.cpp
