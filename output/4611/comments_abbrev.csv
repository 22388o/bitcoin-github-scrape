ajweiss,2014-08-03T03:01:12Z,"Yeah, I'm not a fan of the way they just override HOME to get it to stick the datadir in /var/lib/bitcoin/.bitcoin (yuck) and use start-stop-daemon's --make-pidfile and --background to daemonize outside of bitcoind.  I have something that cribs the good stuff they have in there and I'm testing it.  I'll add a commit with the new stuff soon\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4611#issuecomment-50980714,50980714,
ajweiss,2014-08-06T20:07:06Z,"Ok, I merged in the good stuff from the Gentoo distribution and cleaned things up in general a bit.  I think this is ultimately nicer than the existing Gentoo scripts.  The only thing I can think of is perhaps aiming the documentation a bit more towards doing the install yourself, but it seems that would be best coupled with some work with the gitian build stuff to actually generate binary builds.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4611#issuecomment-51389504,51389504,

laanwj,2014-08-07T09:44:06Z,Nit: I think the default for the system-wide bitcoind should be to run without wallet. This makes it usable for multiple users/applications that want to have their own access to the block chain.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4611#issuecomment-51451262,51451262,

laanwj,2014-08-07T10:05:14Z,"For one, running a wallet makes the security requirements a lot tighter.

There might be some potential confusion that could arise from the wallet being disabled by default, but I'm not sure what to do about that.  Maybe a note in the docs?
