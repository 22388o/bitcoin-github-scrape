instagibbs,2017-05-08T21:35:47Z,nitting: could you set a constant to that value instead of hunting and pecking for the number in case it changes again?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10365#issuecomment-299997908,299997908,
jnewbery,2017-05-08T22:14:26Z,"@instagibbs good point. `wait_until()` currently defaults to having *no* timeout. I can't see how that's useful - we'd want any timed predicate to eventually time out and fail the test. I propose we change `wait_until()` to have a 60 second timeout by default, and then remove the timeout parameter from almost all calls to `wait_until()` Definition is here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/m",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10365#issuecomment-300006144,300006144,
sdaftuar,2017-05-09T00:32:45Z,@jnewbery Makes sense to me; I actually thought we already had a 60 second default and was going to suggest just using that when I saw @instagibbs' comment! ,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10365#issuecomment-300028232,300028232,

jnewbery,2017-05-09T15:33:57Z,"> it might be nice to default the timeout in wait_for_* to float('inf') instead of 60\n\nWhich wait_for_ functions are you referring to? The ones in sendheader.py or in mininode.py?\nWhy is changing the default to float('inf') better?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10365#issuecomment-300203130,300203130,
