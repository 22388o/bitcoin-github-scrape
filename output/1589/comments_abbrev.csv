laanwj,2012-07-12T14:30:27Z,You need a LOCK around every place where the data structure you want to protect is accessed. Defining the critical section locally in a function makes no sense.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1589#issuecomment-6936564,6936564,
Diapolo,2012-07-12T14:34:30Z,"I saw this in the code somewhere else, feeling a little dumb now. I don't want to fiddle around further!\n\nCan we lock `proxyInfo` and `nameproxyInfo` in `SetProxy()` and `SetNameProxy()`? Where should the CCriticalSection be placed? Or is there one we can re-use?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1589#issuecomment-6936676,6936676,

laanwj,2012-07-13T00:07:12Z,"I recommend you read up a bit on parallel programming and synchronization primitives (especially mutexes, in this case), it really helps to know the theory here and it's pretty interesting in any case.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1589#issuecomment-6951398,6951398,
