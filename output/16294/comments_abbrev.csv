Sjors,2019-06-27 18:06:48,"#16289 was the easiest way to fix a broken master branch for macOS tests, but this PR seems like a more thorough long term solution. I don't entirely understand the original problem though.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16294#issuecomment-506451909,506451909,

MarcoFalke,2019-06-27 18:36:19,"> I also don't fully understand the original issue, or why BasicTestingSetup can't seem to clean up after itself\n\nIt does clean up after itself, but the assumption is that ideally only one BasicTestingSetup exists at any point in time for each process (due to use of globals).\n\nWe violate this assumption in the GUI tests, as a testing setup is created as the first step of the `main` functio",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16294#issuecomment-506462306,506462306,
laanwj,2019-07-03 11:44:11,"> It definitely seems good to have only have one BasicTestingSetup active at a time.\n\nwould it make sense to enforce this with an assertion? we intentionally not trying to support this case, so crashing the tests with an assertion seems preferable to the unexpected problems that might happen otherwise",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16294#issuecomment-508058752,508058752,
MarcoFalke,2019-07-03 11:47:56,"There sort of already is an assertion in `ECC_Start()`, which can not be called twice, unless there is a `ECC_Stop()` in between.
