The primary reason is explained better than I can [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1452721/why-is-using-namespace-std-considered-bad-practice). The gist of it is captured in this sentence: \"Library Foo 2.0 could introduce a function, `Quux()`, that is an unambiguously better match for some of your calls to `Quux()` than the `bar::Quux()` your code called for years. Then your code still compiles, but it silently calls the wrong function and does god-knows-what. That's about as bad as things can get.\" Also, a user may see namespace use in one file and think it's fine to do it elsewhere.",

    "body": "Concept ACK, but this may be too disruptive for a single PR, perhaps you should consider dividing it in a few smaller ones. Maybe start with namespace std?\r\nPersonally other uses like ```using namespace benchmark``` ins src/bench/bench.cpp don't bother me that much, but I'm not against removing them either.\r\nAnother advantage of dividing it in smaller ones (apart from each being more reviewable and mergeable separated) is that they will individually require rebase less often.\r\nNeeds rebase.",
