laanwj,2016-07-18T08:46:18Z,"Bah, changing all occurences of 'cost' to 'weight' is a huge change.\nI'm also having second thoughts about it.\nChanging it just in user-facing messages is doable, but yes it also appears in the RPC API, in variable names, in tons of comments. And I suppose those all have to be changed for consistency.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8354#issuecomment-233274167,233274167,
