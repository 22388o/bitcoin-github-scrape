laanwj,2018-07-18T14:07:21Z,"> I'm assuming the problem is that newer clang versions emit a new warning which turns to error due to -Werror being on by default. It's considered bad practice to enable Werror in releases for exactly this reason, so disabling it is for sure a reasonable thing to do.\n\nagree, Werror is for development, not for releases, it makes builds fragile.\n\nutACK a4ba2388feda0be551daca842984c100f002ea",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13689#issuecomment-405943616,405943616,
