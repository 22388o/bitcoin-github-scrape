Don't expect that people won't change to the minimum when MIN_TX_FEE is what Bitcoin includes by default.\n\nTo clarify, if everyone else is paying 0.0001, then why bother paying more; 0.0001/KB fees will get your transactions in. This patch IS effectively reducing the minimum fee, with no justification of why this is a good idea.\n\nI was going to support these assertions by demonstrating how fast fees dropped after 0.3.24 and block ~140000, but hardly any transactions were paying fees anyway due to priority > 57M being commonplace - people weren't sending new inputs to a gambling site dozens of times an hour.\n",

    "body": "@gmaxwell @qubez re: S,DICE while it's true that they are using software that can't calculate per-kb fees properly, remember that they were initially paying a 0.5mBTC fee on every transaction and later upped it to 1mBTC. To me that says they're paying the fees they do to have a competitive bid for limited block space more than anything else, and are just being a bit lazy on the per-kb aspect of it.\n\nThat said, there is a short-term problem with changing MIN_TX_FEE, which is that it's used in GetMinFee(), called by CreateNewBlock(), to determine eligibility for tx inclusion in a new block. How much hashing power will accept these new fees right now?\n",

I've already told bithits and similar people if they want they're low-value transactions mined, the network will relay them, so ask a pool to change their defaults and accept their transactions.\n\nLook at it this way: if a miner fills a block to the 1MB limit with 0.1mBTC/KB transactions, that nets them just 0.1BTC of fees. Why risk orphaning your $1875 subsidy for the sake of $7.5? For that matter, why waste a bunch of expensive skilled labor doing the analysis to determine if that's a good trade-off?\n",

This restores today's operation as default, while allowing reduction for those who will understand the effect of sending with a lower fee. This will also fix a problem that has been posted on the forum, allowfree transactions are now taking hours due to limited free transaction space and block competition; a fee is no longer dust spam discouragement, it's a near-requirement for block inclusion.\n\nmain.cpp:\n// Settings\n-int64 nTransactionFee = 0;\n+int64 nTransactionFee = 50000;\n\nHowever, the send dialog does not indicate the voluntary fee, it should before mucking with things. It looks like the easiest would be another argument in sendcoinsdialog.cpp to show transaction fee too (but I'm no coder to be able to find where to get the Per KB transaction fee; it looks like it's not calculated yet at this point):\n\n![transfeesimple](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1425520/356345/e3231a3e-a102-11e2-8025-dee27511d592.png)\n",
