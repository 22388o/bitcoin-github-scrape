TheBlueMatt,2011-05-20T16:12:37Z,"Hm, not sure why we need to change our indentation format.  It is one of the most common types of indentation/code format (though possibly some different bracket positioning is more common).\n\nThough some of the removal of random spaces at the end of lines and cleaning up number of spaces at various points could be done.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/246#issuecomment-1210866,1210866,
canercandan,2011-05-20T16:29:36Z,"I thought that no standard has been used regarding the indentation of code, so you're right we don't have to take this commit in account even if I like a bit more this style in my Emacs ;)\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/246#issuecomment-1210965,1210965,
