Re-reviewing, this is a bit odd in that it\n- Presented logic in comments implicitly assumes a single message in send buffer\n- Picks an arbitrary inv-related constant as maximum, yet the data we send might be entirely unrelated to inv.\n- Is ignorant of SendBufferSize(), in case that is larger than SEND_BUFFER_MAX_SIZE.\n\nNotably, the _response_ to a 50000-sized inv might push (50000*response) into the send buffer, before the send buffer has a chance to drain.\n",
