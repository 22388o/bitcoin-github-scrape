TheBlueMatt,2012-05-12T16:51:17Z,"Note that this pull is based on #771, which has radically different design goals.  This pull is fairly small on its own.\nRe: the move from main -> protocol.  One of the primary design goals of #771 is to remove the number of globals we export from main, especially the block index/chain storage stuff.  As a part of this, the net code in main.cpp really no longer belongs there, and was moved to pro",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1233#issuecomment-5669958,5669958,
laanwj,2012-05-13T07:58:14Z,"I think those are very sensible design goals.\n\nThat said, in that case we should definitely pull #771 first, to prevent unrelated changes being merged into one pull request.

rebroad,2012-05-14T18:09:26Z,"Ah, ok. Well, I'd certainly find the diffs easier to view if they were kept small.
