gmaxwell,2013-08-25T12:26:58Z,"No, this isn't what we want.  This will break hidden services.  See doc/tor.md.  Normally you set -proxy= when you want to use the proxy exclusively, and that disables listening by default.  #2927 already has listen=0 in any case.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2939#issuecomment-23226819,23226819,

Diapolo,2013-08-26T06:48:00Z,"@gmaxwell Just to get this clear, when I use -tor this is for reaching Tor addresses (hidden services) and this patch would disable listening, if not explicitly enabled and would also lead to disable -upnp and -discover (if not explicitly enabled). How does this break hidden services?\n\n@sipa I guess the patch should be changed to do this for -onlynet=Tor then?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2939#issuecomment-23246165,23246165,
gmaxwell,2013-08-26T06:51:42Z,"@Diapolo because you could no longer receive incoming connections from other hidden service peers. If you intended to have no non-tor connectivity at all you should instead be using proxy. Perhaps this could be better documented.\n\nNo, this shouldn't disable listening for onlynet=tor either, since that will break hidden service inbound too. It should probably disable UPNP when onlynet=tor, howeve",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2939#issuecomment-23246270,23246270,
Diapolo,2013-08-26T07:25:12Z,"@gmaxwell Right, incoming connections would be disabled that way.\n\nWhen I setup Tor and want bitcoin to only use Tor I do this via `-proxy=127.0.0.1:9050 -externalip=XYZ.onion -onlynet=""Tor"" -bind=127.0.0.1` (perhaps that configuration should be mentioned in tor.md?), which explicitly ENABLES incoming connections.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2939#issuecomment-23247378,23247378,
