gmaxwell,2012-12-10T19:00:05Z,"I don't think disallowing IPv4 local connections (e.g. from mining daemons and monitoring tools) is a desired effect of onlynet.  I suspect this will also block all onion peers even when onlynet tor, though I haven't actually tried it.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2089#issuecomment-11211916,11211916,
Diapolo,2012-12-10T20:31:54Z,"IMHO when we have a switch to block certain networks, this should include ALL connections (in- and outbound). What did we intend with `-onlynet` otherwise?\n\nIf people really want to explicitly allow IPv4 connections, they can use `-bind` (remember #1778, which is for such cases). As this network-block is not active for RPC-stuff AFAIK, I really see no problem here.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2089#issuecomment-11216131,11216131,
sipa,2012-12-10T20:33:33Z,But the problem is that incoming onion connections come in as an IPv4 connection from 127.0.0.1. So -onlynet=tor would block incoming onion connections...\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2089#issuecomment-11216186,11216186,
Diapolo,2012-12-10T20:34:50Z,"Right, so the user could just add -bind=127.0.0.1 :).\n\nThis is from the commit message of #1778:\n`usage case: specify -bind=127.0.0.1 -onlynet=""Tor"" to allow incoming connections to a Tor hidden service, but still don't allow other IPv4 nodes to connect / get connected`\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2089#issuecomment-11216236,11216236,
sipa,2012-12-10T20:35:54Z,Yes. but this very commit will still block such connections.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2089#issuecomment-11216285,11216285,
