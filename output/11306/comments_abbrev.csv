achow101,2017-09-12T15:57:08Z,NACK. Large refactors like this shouldn't really be done as they will break a lot of unmerged pull requests.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11306#issuecomment-328898187,328898187,
laanwj,2017-09-20T16:22:31Z,"I'd prefer to do this in the longer term - move groups of files to a directory that makes sense for them. Moving everything that is now in the source root to a single subdirectory of `src` has some advantages, but IMO not enough for all the rebasing work this will cause.\n\nSo NACK from me, sorry.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11306#issuecomment-330905568,330905568,
