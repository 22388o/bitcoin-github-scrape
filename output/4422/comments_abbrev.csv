jtimon,2014-06-27T10:56:25Z,"@sipa I assumed HexStr(pblock->nBits) was going to be equivalent to uint256().SetCompact(pblock->nBits).GetHex() but I didn't tested the output. I can leave as it was.\n\n@laanwj using strprintf(""%08x"", nBits) to replace HexBits instead of defining the new specialized HexStr seems better (less additions, the same deletions) if the outputs are equivalent.
