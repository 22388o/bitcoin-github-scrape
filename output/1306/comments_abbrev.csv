laanwj,2012-05-15T05:39:23Z,"How can ""things work more reliably through tor""? Tor routes your connections through several other nodes, it's never been set up for reliability but for privacy. Connecting through Tor 50% of the times annihilates 100% of that hard won privacy. \n\nYou seem to have routing issues with your network. Fix these, or use a load-balancing proxy or VPN to work around it. But don't try to fix this in bitc",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1306#issuecomment-5708831,5708831,
rebroad,2012-05-15T15:24:10Z,"@laanwj you are of course correct, in that there is probably software which could take care of the routing, routing some via tor, some directly, etc. I'm not aware of any, but I'm sure it exists. Would you be willing to let me know of the software that does this?\n\nI think it's a simple enough change, and I agree that a minority of people will use it. Would it be more agreeable if the proxytoo op",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1306#issuecomment-5718674,5718674,
TheBlueMatt,2012-05-20T14:26:13Z,"I agree with @laanwj, I think ""sometimes things work more reliably through tor, and at other times directly"" is a sign that you either have issues with your connection, or the peer selection algorithms are doing a woefully poor job (depending on what, exactly you mean by work more reliably).

TheBlueMatt,2012-05-20T16:36:21Z,"Oh, well in that case I would say a) you should look into other providers (if available) or complain because you arent getting access to the internet, you are getting access to some filtered, crappy version of it and b) do we handle getting our connections dropped that poorly?
