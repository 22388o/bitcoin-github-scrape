        "patch": "@@ -0,0 +1,203 @@\n+0.21.1 Release Notes\n+====================\n+\n+Bitcoin Core version 0.21.1 is now available from:\n+\n+  <https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-0.21.1/>\n+\n+This minor release includes various bug fixes and performance\n+improvements, as well as updated translations.\n+\n+Please report bugs using the issue tracker at GitHub:\n+\n+  <https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues>\n+\n+To receive security and update notifications, please subscribe to:\n+\n+  <https://bitcoincore.org/en/list/announcements/join/>\n+\n+How to Upgrade\n+==============\n+\n+If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely\n+shut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run the\n+installer (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt` (on Mac)\n+or `bitcoind`/`bitcoin-qt` (on Linux).\n+\n+Upgrading directly from a version of Bitcoin Core that has reached its EOL is\n+possible, but it might take some time if the data directory needs to be migrated. Old\n+wallet versions of Bitcoin Core are generally supported.\n+\n+Compatibility\n+==============\n+\n+Bitcoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systems\n+using the Linux kernel, macOS 10.12+, and Windows 7 and newer.  Bitcoin\n+Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not as\n+frequently tested on them.  It is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core on\n+unsupported systems.\n+\n+From Bitcoin Core 0.20.0 onwards, macOS versions earlier than 10.12 are no\n+longer supported. Additionally, Bitcoin Core does not yet change appearance\n+when macOS \"dark mode\" is activated.\n+\n+Notable changes\n+===============\n+\n+## Taproot Soft Fork\n+\n+Included in this release are the mainnet and testnet activation\n+parameters for the taproot soft fork (BIP341) which also adds support\n+for schnorr signatures (BIP340) and tapscript (BIP342).\n+\n+If activated, these improvements will allow users of single-signature\n+scripts, multisignature scripts, and complex contracts to all use\n+identical-appearing commitments that enhance their privacy and the\n+fungibility of all bitcoins. Spenders will enjoy lower fees and the\n+ability to resolve many multisig scripts and complex contracts with the\n+same efficiency, low fees, and large anonymity set as single-sig users.\n+Taproot and schnorr also include efficiency improvements for full nodes\n+such as the ability to batch signature verification.  Together, the\n+improvements lay the groundwork for future potential\n+upgrades that may improve efficiency, privacy, and fungibility further.\n+\n+Activation for taproot is being managed using a variation of BIP9\n+versionbits called Speedy Trial (described in BIP341). Taproot's\n+versionbit is bit 2, and nodes will begin tracking which blocks signal\n+support for taproot at the beginning of the first retarget period after\n+taproot\u2019s start date of 24 April 2021.  If 90% of blocks within a\n+2,016-block retarget period (about two weeks) signal support for taproot\n+prior to the first retarget period beginning after the time of 11 August\n+2021, the soft fork will be locked in, and taproot will then be active\n+as of block 709632 (expected in early or mid November).\n+\n+Should taproot not be locked in via Speedy Trial activation, it is\n+expected that a follow-up activation mechanism will be deployed, with\n+changes to address the reasons the Speedy Trial method failed.\n+\n+This release includes the ability to pay taproot addresses, although\n+payments to such addresses are not secure until taproot activates.\n+It also includes the ability to relay and mine taproot transactions\n+after activation.  Beyond those two basic capabilities, this release\n+does not include any code that allows anyone to directly use taproot.\n+The addition of taproot-related features to Bitcoin Core's wallet is\n+expected in later releases once taproot activation is assured.\n+\n+All users, businesses, and miners are encouraged to upgrade to this\n+release (or a subsequent compatible release) unless they object to\n+activation of taproot.  If taproot is locked in, then upgrading before\n+block 709632 is highly recommended to help enforce taproot's new rules\n+and to avoid the unlikely case of seeing falsely confirmed transactions.\n+\n+Miners who want to activate Taproot should preferably use this release\n+to control their signaling.  The `getblocktemplate` RPC results will\n+automatically be updated to signal once the appropriate start has been\n+reached and continue signaling until the timeout occurs or taproot\n+activates.  Alternatively, miners may manually start signaling on bit 2\n+at any time; if taproot activates, they will need to ensure they update\n+their nodes before block 709632 or non-upgraded nodes could cause them to mine on\n+an invalid chain.  See the [versionbits\n+FAQ](https://bitcoincore.org/en/2016/06/08/version-bits-miners-faq/) for\n+details.\n+\n+\n+For more information about taproot, please see the following resources:\n+\n+- Technical specifications\n+  - [BIP340 Schnorr signatures for secp256k1](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0340.mediawiki) \n+  - [BIP341 Taproot: SegWit version 1 spending rules](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0341.mediawiki)\n+  - [BIP342 Validation of Taproot scripts](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0342.mediawiki)\n+\n+- Popular articles;\n+  - [Taproot Is Coming: What It Is, and How It Will Benefit Bitcoin](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/taproot-coming-what-it-and-how-it-will-benefit-bitcoin)\n+  - [What do Schnorr Signatures Mean for Bitcoin?](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-do-schnorr-signatures-mean-for-bitcoin)\n+  - [The Schnorr Signature & Taproot Softfork Proposal](https://blog.bitmex.com/the-schnorr-signature-taproot-softfork-proposal/)\n+\n+- Development history overview\n+  - [Taproot](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/taproot/)\n+  - [Schnorr signatures](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/schnorr-signatures/)\n+  - [Tapscript](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/tapscript/)\n+  - [Soft fork activation](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/soft-fork-activation/)\n+\n+- Other\n+  - [Questions and answers related to taproot](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/taproot)\n+  - [Taproot review](https://github.com/ajtowns/taproot-review)\n+\n+Updated RPCs\n+------------\n+\n+- Due to [BIP 350](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0350.mediawiki)\n+  being implemented, behavior for all RPCs that accept addresses is changed when\n+  a native witness version 1 (or higher) is passed. These now require a Bech32m\n+  encoding instead of a Bech32 one, and Bech32m encoding will be used for such\n+  addresses in RPC output as well. No version 1 addresses should be created\n+  for mainnet until consensus rules are adopted that give them meaning\n+  (e.g. through [BIP 341](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0341.mediawiki)).\n+  Once that happens, Bech32m is expected to be used for them, so this shouldn't\n+  affect any production systems, but may be observed on other networks where such\n+  addresses already have meaning (like signet).\n+\n+0.21.1 change log\n+=================\n+\n+### Consensus\n+- #21377 Speedy trial support for versionbits (ajtowns)\n+- #21686 Speedy trial activation parameters for Taproot (achow101)\n+\n+### P2P protocol and network code\n+- #20852 allow CSubNet of non-IP networks (vasild)\n+- #21043 Avoid UBSan warning in ProcessMessage(\u2026) (practicalswift)\n+\n+### Wallet\n+- #21166 Introduce DeferredSignatureChecker and have SignatureExtractorClass subclass it (achow101)\n+- #21083 Avoid requesting fee rates multiple times during coin selection (achow101)\n+\n+### RPC and other APIs\n+- #21201 Disallow sendtoaddress and sendmany when private keys disabled (achow101)\n+\n+### Build system\n+- #21486 link against -lsocket if required for `*ifaddrs` (fanquake)\n+- #20983 Fix MSVC build after gui#176 (hebasto)\n+\n+### Tests and QA\n+- #21380 Add fuzzing harness for versionbits (ajtowns)\n+- #20812 fuzz: Bump FuzzedDataProvider.h (MarcoFalke)\n+- #20740 fuzz: Update FuzzedDataProvider.h from upstream (LLVM) (practicalswift)\n+- #21446 Update vcpkg checkout commit (sipsorcery)\n+- #21397 fuzz: Bump FuzzedDataProvider.h (MarcoFalke)\n+- #21081 Fix the unreachable code at `feature_taproot` (brunoerg)\n+- #20562 Test that a fully signed tx given to signrawtx is unchanged (achow101)\n+- #21571 Make sure non-IP peers get discouraged and disconnected (vasild, MarcoFalke)\n+- #21489 fuzz: cleanups for versionbits fuzzer (ajtowns)\n+\n+### Miscellaneous\n+- #20861 BIP 350: Implement Bech32m and use it for v1+ segwit addresses (sipa)\n+\n+### Documentation\n+- #21384 add signet to bitcoin.conf documentation (jonatack)\n+- #21342 Remove outdated comment (hebasto)\n+\n+Credits\n+=======\n+\n+Thanks to everyone who directly contributed to this release:\n+\n+- Aaron Clauson\n+- Andrew Chow\n+- Anthony Towns\n+- Bruno Garcia\n+- Fabian Jahr\n+- fanquake\n+- Hennadii Stepanov\n+- Jon Atack\n+- Luke Dashjr\n+- MarcoFalke\n+- Pieter Wuille\n+- practicalswift\n+- randymcmillan\n+- Sjors Provoost\n+- Vasil Dimov\n+- W.
