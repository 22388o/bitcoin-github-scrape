    "body": "Regarding my suggestion in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13707#discussion_r203628395: it should be noted that a nit is just a suggested change for a trivial often non-blocking issue. Not all style nits end up in the developer notes (due to various reasons: no clear consensus, not worth documenting, etc.).\r\n\r\nWith that out of the way I'm ACK:ing this PR:\r\n\r\nThe Python documentation is discouraging the use of the old string formatting style (`'%s' % x`):\r\n\r\n> **4.7.2. printf-style String Formatting**\r\n> Note: The formatting operations described here exhibit a variety of quirks that lead to a number of common errors (such as failing to display tuples and dictionaries correctly). Using the newer formatted string literals, the str.format() interface, or template strings may help avoid these errors. Each of these alternatives provides their own trade-offs and benefits of simplicity, flexibility, and/or extensibility.\r\n\r\nFrom older Python 3 documentation about `'%s' % x`:\r\n\r\n> **5.6.2. Old String Formatting Operations**\r\n> Note: The formatting operations described here are obsolete and may go away in future versions of Python. Use the new String Formatting in new code.\r\n\r\nACK b1b8863fd6fa54fa90f32fd2e384b0f257d0f526\r\n\r\nTrivia: When we move to Python 3.6 we can start using [formatted string literals (\"f-strings\")](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498/) as well :-)\r\n",
