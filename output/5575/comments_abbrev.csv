sipa,2015-01-04T15:23:06Z,"I have an alternative suggestion here, namely to 'degrade' accounts back into labels. That means marking all RPC methods that operate on the concept of an ""account balance"" as deprecated, but not the ability to list transactions received with a particular label etc.\n\nPro: address labels already exist in the GUI and we probably want to keep them there, so making the RPC functionality analogous sh",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5575#issuecomment-68636399,68636399,

luke-jr,2015-01-04T15:42:30Z,@sipa That may not be as simple as you think - GUI labels and accounts overlap _only_ for receive transactions. Send transaction labels and send account are entirely unrelated right now. :/\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5575#issuecomment-68637050,68637050,
laanwj,2015-01-05T08:04:56Z,"I like sipa's idea. The labels feature is useful, and aiming to expose it _eventually_ in both RPC and the GUI would make things symmetrical, which is what many users expect.\n\nOn the other hand doing that without confusing current users of accounts even more will be difficult. Hence I like first communicating a complete deprecation of the account system as in this pull.\n\nThen introduce a _new_",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5575#issuecomment-68678056,68678056,
