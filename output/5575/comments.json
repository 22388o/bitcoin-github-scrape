That means marking all RPC methods that operate on the concept of an \"account balance\" as deprecated, but not the ability to list transactions received with a particular label etc.\n\nPro: address labels already exist in the GUI and we probably want to keep them there, so making the RPC functionality analogous should be easy, and it doesn't have the potential confusion risk that accounts have.\nCons: If we're going to break functionality, maybe it should be broken entirely.\n",

The labels feature is useful, and aiming to expose it _eventually_ in both RPC and the GUI would make things symmetrical, which is what many users expect.\n\nOn the other hand doing that without confusing current users of accounts even more will be difficult. Hence I like first communicating a complete deprecation of the account system as in this pull.\n\nThen introduce a _new_ API for labels. This also makes it clear that the label system is separately useful and not just 'degraded accounts'. The usual warning apply - \"don't use this at the same time as the account system, or it will get confused\".\n",

    "body": "> That means marking all RPC methods that operate on the concept of an \"account balance\" as deprecated, but not the ability to list transactions received with a particular label etc.\n\nAs there would no longer be a concept of 'account address' or 'account balance' the label API could be very minimal, e.g.:\n- `getaddressesforlabel` [like getaddressesforaccount]\n- `listlabels` [like listaccounts, but would just return a list of labels, without balances - and would need an argument to filter for sending/receiving labels]\n- `setlabel` (address, label) [like setaccount, but also allows setting labels for sending addresses]\n\nThese would stay the same, and accept a label instead of an account:\n- `getnewaddress` (label)\n- `listtransactions` (label,...)\n\nOthers, like `sendfrom` would no longer make sense at all, eg. there is no point in sending from a label.\n",
