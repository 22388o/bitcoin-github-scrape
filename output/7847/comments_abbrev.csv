laanwj,2016-04-09T07:40:45Z,Travis failure is unrelated and intermittent (#7463).\n\nBTW for doc-only changes like this you can put `[skip ci]` in the pull request description (not in the title)\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7847#issuecomment-207735455,207735455,
MarcoFalke,2016-04-09T10:32:37Z,> put [skip ci] in the pull request description\n\nI think travis no longer fetches this from GitHub. You'd have to put it in the commit body.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7847#issuecomment-207767280,207767280,
