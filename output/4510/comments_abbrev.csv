laanwj,2014-07-12T07:38:09Z,"ACK. Indeed. You can specify -datadir in the config file. This is especially useful if you specify -conf, as you can define a whole configuration from the config file.\n\nThis is good as it replaces 'datadir-based' thinking, where the datadir defines where the configuration file is. After all there are good reasons to keep configuration files and data in separate places. See also #4124.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4510#issuecomment-48804993,48804993,
