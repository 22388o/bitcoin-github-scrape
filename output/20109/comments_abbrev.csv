Xekyo,2020-10-09 10:20:18,I see that this follows the rule for braces from the coding style putting braces on new lines for methods: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/developer-notes.md#coding-style-c,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20109#discussion_r502331930,502331930,src/node/transaction.cpp
Xekyo,2020-10-09 10:23:32,I noticed that the declaration of `fee` here was moved to a closer scope. As `fee` does not get used outside of the scope this appears to not change behaviour.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20109#discussion_r502333571,502333571,src/node/transaction.cpp
Xekyo,2020-10-09 10:37:16,"Given that the criteria to throw this reject reason appears to be the exceeding of a _feerate_, would it not be more informative to make the `reject-reason` `max-feerate-exceeded` instead of `max-fee-exceeded`?

glozow,2020-10-09 15:59:25,I guess I was trying to justify the error code change but yeah it's irrelevant here.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20109#discussion_r502527949,502527949,doc/release-notes.md

Xekyo,2020-10-09 16:09:19,"It's a bit of a pet-peeve of mine that *fees* and *feerates* are often mixed up in Bitcoin, but the ship has probably sailed for this change? :thinking:\nI'll have to be faster next time. ;)",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20109#discussion_r502533592,502533592,doc/release-notes.md

sipa,2020-10-09 17:20:00,"@Xekyo You're absolutely right that they're often mixed up, but in this context it is actually referring to an absolute fee (by default 0.1 BTC...) rather than a feerate.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20109#discussion_r502570224,502570224,doc/release-notes.md
Xekyo,2020-10-09 17:33:30,"Okay, thanks for the clarification. I'm a bit confused by this description then:\n\n>  The `sendrawtransaction` error code for exceeding `maxfeerate` has been changed from  `-26` to `-25`. The error string has been changed from ""absurdly-high-fee"" to  ""Fee exceeds maximum configured by user (e.g. -maxtxfee, maxfeerate).""

achow101,2020-10-13 18:28:42,I think this should also list the name for these error codes as the number itself is a harder to undertsand.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20109#discussion_r504170916,504170916,doc/release-notes.md
