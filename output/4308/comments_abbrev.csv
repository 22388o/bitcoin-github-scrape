But then the descriptions in help and GUI have to be changed.\nIt only says ""Fee per kB to add to transactions you send"".\n\nCoin control also needs to be fixed, because currently cc assumes we never round.\nBut in the voluntary case, we round now up to 1000 bytes. Else we never round.\n\nI will submit a pr.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4308#issuecomment-46217512,46217512,
