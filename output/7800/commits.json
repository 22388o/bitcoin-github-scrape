The version number consists of 0x20000000 to indicate version\n+bits together with setting bit 0 to indicate support for this combined\n+deployment, shown as \"csv\" in the `getblockchaininfo` RPC call.\n+\n+For more information about the soft forking change, please see\n+<https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7648>\n+\n+This specific backport pull-request can be viewed at\n+<https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7543>\n+\n+[BIP9]: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0009.mediawiki\n+[BIP68]: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0068.mediawiki\n+[BIP112]: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0112.mediawiki\n+\n+BIP68 soft fork to enforce sequence locks for relative locktime\n+---------------------------------------------------------------\n+\n+[BIP68][] introduces relative lock-time consensus-enforced semantics of\n+the sequence number field to enable a signed transaction input to remain\n+invalid for a defined period of time after confirmation of its corresponding\n+outpoint.\n+\n+For more information about the implementation, see\n+<https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7184>\n+\n+BIP112 soft fork to enforce OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY\n+--------------------------------------------------\n+\n+[BIP112][] redefines the existing OP_NOP3 as OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY (CSV)\n+for a new opcode in the Bitcoin scripting system that in combination with\n+[BIP68][] allows execution pathways of a script to be restricted based\n+on the age of the output being spent.\n+\n+For more information about the implementation, see\n+<https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7524>\n+\n+BIP113 locktime enforcement soft fork\n+-------------------------------------\n+\n+Bitcoin Core 0.11.2 previously introduced mempool-only locktime\n+enforcement using GetMedianTimePast(). This release seeks to\n+consensus enforce the rule.\n+\n+Bitcoin transactions currently may specify a locktime indicating when\n+they may be added to a valid block.  Current consensus rules require\n+that blocks have a block header time greater than the locktime specified\n+in any transaction in that block.\n+\n+Miners get to choose what time they use for their header time, with the\n+consensus rule being that no node will accept a block whose time is more\n+than two hours in the future.  This creates a incentive for miners to\n+set their header times to future values in order to include locktimed\n+transactions which weren't supposed to be included for up to two more\n+hours.\n+\n+The consensus rules also specify that valid blocks may have a header\n+time greater than that of the median of the 11 previous blocks.  This\n+GetMedianTimePast() time has a key feature we generally associate with\n+time: it can't go backwards.\n+\n+[BIP113][] specifies a soft fork enforced in this release that\n+weakens this perverse incentive for individual miners to use a future\n+time by requiring that valid blocks have a computed GetMedianTimePast()\n+greater than the locktime specified in any transaction in that block.\n+\n+Mempool inclusion rules currently require transactions to be valid for\n+immediate inclusion in a block in order to be accepted into the mempool.\n+This release begins applying the BIP113 rule to received transactions,\n+so transaction whose time is greater than the GetMedianTimePast() will\n+no longer be accepted into the mempool.\n+\n+**Implication for miners:** you will begin rejecting transactions that\n+would not be valid under BIP113, which will prevent you from producing\n+invalid blocks when BIP113 is enforced on the network. Any\n+transactions which are valid under the current rules but not yet valid\n+under the BIP113 rules will either be mined by other miners or delayed\n+until they are valid under BIP113. Note, however, that time-based\n+locktime transactions are more or less unseen on the network currently.\n+\n+**Implication for users:** GetMedianTimePast() always trails behind the\n+current time, so a transaction locktime set to the present time will be\n+rejected by nodes running this release until the median time moves\n+forward. To compensate, subtract one hour (3,600 seconds) from your\n+locktimes to allow those transactions to be included in mempools at\n+approximately the expected time.\n+\n+For more information about the implementation, see\n+<https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6566>\n+\n+Miscellaneous\n+-------------\n+\n+The p2p alert system is off by default. To turn on, use `-alert` with\n+startup configuration.\n \n 0.12.1 Change log\n ================="
