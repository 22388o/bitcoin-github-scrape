rebroad,2014-05-16T02:40:16Z,@laanwj @sipa @gmaxwell Some comments/ACKS would be appreciated. Thanks.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3990#issuecomment-43289756,43289756,
laanwj,2014-05-16T07:22:46Z,I like printing always the full hash. It used to be different in earlier\nversions but at a certain point it was decided to change this.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3990#issuecomment-43304090,43304090,
sipa,2014-05-16T08:36:51Z,Indeed. It allows easy copy pasting entries from the log file into RPCs or\nother services.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3990#issuecomment-43309076,43309076,
rebroad,2014-05-21T11:58:00Z,Please can you look at what this pull request does. It doesn't change the way hashes are displayed as the assumption seems to have been. It simply doesn't display a long line of ONLY zeros when there is NO hash as it does currently.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3990#issuecomment-43745064,43745064,
rebroad,2014-05-21T11:59:01Z,"@laanwj please can you re-open this pull request, as it was misunderstood what it does. thank you.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3990#issuecomment-43745150,43745150,
laanwj,2014-05-21T12:24:37Z,I still don't really see the point of making a special case for 0.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3990#issuecomment-43747279,43747279,
rebroad,2014-06-27T03:27:21Z,"@laanwj because 0 isn't a hash, it's like a NULL, so it seems wasteful to fill debug.log with an expanded hash of NULL, when it's not a hash.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3990#issuecomment-47304556,47304556,
laanwj,2014-06-27T08:18:47Z,"Right, uint256(0) _is_ a special case here. It's a pity that things were done this way in the protocol, but you can't help that. Reopening.\n\nIf we're special-casing anyway, what about using a string such as ""end"" or ""last"" instead of ""0""? ""To 0"" reads like it's trying to requests the blocks to the beginning instead...\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3990#issuecomment-47318760,47318760,
rebroad,2014-06-28T02:56:47Z,"@laanwj ah, yes, ""end"" is more clear. Changed.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3990#issuecomment-47416258,47416258,
