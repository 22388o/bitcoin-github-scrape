And if the forward declaration is really necessary (e.g. circular dependency, compilation speed concerns) then that should be in its own header that is included by \"users\". For example, it is annoying to have to change `struct Foo` to `class Foo` with forward declarations spilled all over the place.",

    "body": "> Any reason not to use `#include <univalue.h>` here instead of `class UniValue;` (there is no circular dependency in this case)?\r\n> \r\n> I think by default it should be preferred to include the header instead of doing the forward declaration. And if the forward declaration is really necessary (e.g. circular dependency, compilation speed concerns) then that should be in its own header that is included by \"users\". For example, it is annoying to have to change `struct Foo` to `class Foo` with forward declarations spilled all over the place.\r\n\r\nI have the opposite preference and prefer simple forward declarations whenever possible instead of includes. (Simple forward declarations meaning declarations like `class Foo;` or `struct Foo;` `enum class Foo;` not declarations for templates, typedefs, or std:: types). I don't think forward declarations are just a workaround for circular dependencies. I think they also are important for keeping build times under control and for eliminating dependencies between modules while allowing them to pass data in an opaque but type safe way (avoiding void*). It's possible my preference is out of date (it comes from working on projects using IWYU https://github.com/include-what-you-use/include-what-you-use/blob/master/docs/WhyIWYU.md#why-forward-declare), though, and it probably wouldn't be a bad idea to have a linter or developer note for more consistency here if you wanted to follow up!",

Not especially nasty as far as I can see. The second one seems like FUD. Is there a realistic example of this happening? Could the example happen accidentally, or would you have to go out of your way to engineer an it like in void* inheritance case? If this could happen accidentally, would basic sentient human code review or use of \"grep\" catch it?\r\n\r\nThere are practical benefits to using simple forward declarations like the non-template non-typedef non-std:: ones I write myself, or the ones created by the IWYU tool. Obviously there are specific situations where forward declarations are bad to use and the google style guide covers them well. But there is no reason to throw out the baby with the bathwater with another one of these \"X considered harmful\" proclamations. Especially since unlike other X's, you can't actually get rid forward includes if you want to write type-safe modular code.\r\n\r\nI will also say that I like the use of forward declarations aesthetically and semantically. An include says \"the code in this file depends on this code in this other file\". A forward declaration when it is properly used (something enforceable by IWYU) says \"the code in this file does NOT depend on this type, and is just letting code in two other files that do you use the type communicate safely.\"",
