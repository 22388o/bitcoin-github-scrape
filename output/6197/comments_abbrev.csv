laanwj,2015-05-29T10:30:56Z,"Either is fine with me too, although I have a slight preference for @petertodd 's solution due to lower impact.\nThe constant is an _upper bound_ on the possible coins, not the limit value of the cumulative reward function, so `MAX_xxx` is sort of appropriate, the new name is a bit awkward and pedantic (but correct). Getting rid of the word `money` on the other hand is nice...\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6197#issuecomment-106767718,106767718,
petertodd,2015-05-29T12:06:00Z,"The word ""money"" doesn't bother me at all, but I'd there was consensus to change it, the phrase MAX_VALUE is much less awkward.
