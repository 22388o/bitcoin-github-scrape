Confusion was caused by ```replaceable``` which can have non binary values.\n\n>  I also think all the filtering stuff is a mess, and there's probably no point adding to it\n\nI agree. However, there is no clear solution - either this needs to be marked as obsolete/to remove, or it needs to",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12862#issuecomment-378215475,378215475,
