somdoron,2017-06-12T06:32:37Z,"You can also call socket.SET(zmq.RCVTIMEO, 60000) when creating the socket instead of the NOBLOCK and the loop. It will raise zmq.error.Again when time is over",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10555#discussion_r121317876,121317876,test/functional/zmq_test.py
jnewbery,2017-06-12T13:16:41Z,Thanks! I didn't know about `zmq.RCVTIMEO`. Updated to use that instead of the timeout loop in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10555/commits/b1bac1cb7ea1560b46ff758864660a21a228ed67,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10555#discussion_r121388807,121388807,test/functional/zmq_test.py
