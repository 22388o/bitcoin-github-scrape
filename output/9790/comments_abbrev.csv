jnewbery,2017-02-17T23:32:46Z,NACK. You seem to have accidentally removed the part about priority transaction sorting for mining being deprecated in Core and being removed in the next major version.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9790#issuecomment-280795489,280795489,
luke-jr,2017-02-17T23:35:05Z,"Not accidentally, it's documented in the summary. There is no consensus to remove priority mining.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9790#issuecomment-280795907,280795907,
sipa,2017-02-17T23:42:54Z,"Please stop this, @luke-jr. I'm aware you dislike the removal of priority mining and respect that, but it seems the vast majority of contributors to the project agree it is pointless to maintain at this point.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9790#issuecomment-280797039,280797039,
luke-jr,2017-02-17T23:53:03Z,"@sipa I tried to find a compromise where nobody had to maintain it besides me, but certain people were stubborn and refused. So the status quo of ""no consensus to remove"" remains for now.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9790#issuecomment-280798540,280798540,
sipa,2017-02-17T23:56:39Z,"@luke-jr This is not a consensus change, and it's not up to you to block this. I absolutely respect that you want priority mining to remain available, but you'll have to do it in your own fork, or develop an external tool that implements it through `prioritizetransaction` RPC calls (which seems very useful in any case as an example).",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9790#issuecomment-280799034,280799034,
luke-jr,2017-02-18T00:07:04Z,"@sipa I think [this comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/9601#issuecomment-279600986) deserves proper consideration before any final decision is made. But in the case that priority is to be removed, how about simply adding to the current text, ""Miners who wish to retain this feature should switch to Bitcoin Knots, where it will continue to be maintained and supported for the time bei",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9790#issuecomment-280800601,280800601,

luke-jr,2017-02-18T00:51:31Z,"I do consider it relevant, and even aside from that, it is up to miners to decide on their own if they consider it relevant, not to have information about its availability suppressed so they are forced out of using it.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9790#issuecomment-280806120,280806120,
