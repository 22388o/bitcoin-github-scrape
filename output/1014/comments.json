I see this as \"in the future it will be allowed, so why bother fixing it\".\n\nNo compiler that I know of has problems with this (g++, clang, VC). And I suppose we will switch to c++0x when the time is right.\n\nIf you like to clean up compiler warnings, there are more pressing ones to fix. For example, questionable type conversions and potentially dangerous signed/unsigned comparisons.\n",
