There should be coding standards for this, as everyone seems to handle this differently all over the source, which is bad practise IMHO.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1014#issuecomment-4858599,4858599,
laanwj,2012-04-02T07:10:57Z,"I think sipa's patch-cleanlyness argument is pretty convincing. I see this as ""in the future it will be allowed, so why bother fixing it"".\n\nNo compiler that I know of has problems with this (g++, clang, VC). And I suppose we will switch to c++0x when the time is right.\n\nIf you like to clean up compiler warnings, there are more pressing ones to fix.
