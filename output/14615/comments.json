    "body": "@Peppernrino sorry your PR was closed, and thanks for trying to contribute, but this isn't about \"crazy veto power\". Note that Luke only said he had no objection, not that he liked it, and we have hundreds of open pull requests to review, so a change which affects 102 different files without clear benefits is quite a burden on reviewers. So a NACK with good reasoning in this case is enough to warrant closure. Perhaps you could take a look at some of the open issues in the repository and find a different way to contribute :)",

Image compression is a serious subject, I would be the last to disagree, but not in the context of bitcoin and digital currency.
