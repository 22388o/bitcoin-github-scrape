laanwj,2018-02-17T09:55:29Z,"Concept ACK.\n\n> Building bitcoin as c++11 and univalue as c++03/c++14 (depending on compiler version) is pretty scary\n\nThere are certainly some rough edge cases, but in theory (no compiler bugs) this should be ok, right? Is there any official guideline about this?\n\nDoesn't building against system libraries have the same risks? You can never be sure what c++ standard they were compiled ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12467#issuecomment-366430379,366430379,
