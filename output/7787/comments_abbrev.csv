paveljanik,2016-04-02T14:51:23Z,Concept ACK.\n\nI think that the `return true` is to have the same prototypes of both Warning and Error functions. Is it worth it?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7787#issuecomment-204728525,204728525,
MarcoFalke,2016-04-02T15:05:57Z,"> Is it worth it?\n\nNo, InitError should fail and trigger a shutdown. InitWarning, however, should not trigger a shutdown and continue execution. Thus the return value is not only unused but also misleading.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7787#issuecomment-204731153,204731153,

jonasschnelli,2016-04-02T18:01:09Z,"Concept ACK.\nNot sure if the function names should contain the `Init*` part (like `InitError()` and `InitWarning()`). From the `ui_interface` perspective, the error/warning is unrelated to the init process.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7787#issuecomment-204766454,204766454,
MarcoFalke,2016-04-03T08:53:25Z,"> the error/warning is unrelated to the init process.\n\nThis is a valid point, but I think there is no actual use case for a _modal_ pop up other than in the init process. I'd rather keep the old name, and change it when there is a valid use case for a blocking dialog.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7787#issuecomment-204918700,204918700,
