shigeya,2018-02-28T22:47:25Z,"Hmm. Looks like intentional trailing space (to adjust indentation of the following text) for formatting cause the issue. I will look into the lint code, but, simply forbid such a trailing space don't work in this context. I tried to rewrite the text prior the `apt-get` commands but can't find a better way to rewrite. Will fix in either way.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12526#issuecomment-369410700,369410700,
shigeya,2018-03-02T04:31:14Z,I have modified to eliminate description trailing in `apt-get` code block. I will look into the lint code on spare time in future.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12526#issuecomment-369817130,369817130,
