bolekC,2018-01-14T21:54:36Z,Tend to agree with NACK. This code is anyway a bit too long so `continue` can help to read. ,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12181#issuecomment-357545760,357545760,
ghost,2018-01-14T22:08:53Z,I think a comment at the end of the scope might serve as better documentation ( // End while loop ). A continue does not provide this information IMHO.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12181#issuecomment-357546704,357546704,
