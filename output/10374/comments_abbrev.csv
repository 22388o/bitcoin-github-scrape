jimmysong,2017-05-09T21:51:14Z,"This is great functionality to allow tests to be run multiple times. It might be useful to edit https://github.com/MarcoFalke/bitcoin/blob/Mf1705-qaWarnTestNotFound/test/README.md#functional-tests  to specify that you can, in fact, run the same test a few times to catch intermittent errors.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10374#discussion_r115611559,115611559,test/functional/test_runner.py
jimmysong,2017-05-09T21:56:37Z,"This will only remove the first instance of `exclude_test` from `test_list`. It's now possible that there are multiple instances of the script from line 176 above. Something like this will work:\n\n    test_list = list(filter(lambda t: t == exclude_test, test_list))",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10374#discussion_r115612544,115612544,test/functional/test_runner.py
jnewbery,2017-05-10T15:30:44Z,nit: comment is now incorrect (since this is a list rather than a set),https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10374#discussion_r115773782,115773782,test/functional/test_runner.py
MarcoFalke,2017-05-14T10:31:52Z,"This is a feature. If you really want to specify the same test multiple times, and then exclude it again, you need to specify it multiple times as well. Though, I doubt this will ever be relevant.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10374#discussion_r116377604,116377604,test/functional/test_runner.py
