It'll be great to have a real solution for this.\r\n\r\nI have a few concerns about the approach here:\r\n-  event_base_get_num_events is not a great representative of the connection count, as our own timers and triggers will throw off the count\r\n- I think keep-alive connections need to be closed if they're re-used once the connection limit has been reached, otherwise it becomes trivial to monopolize the available slots.\r\n- It unfortunately doesn't help with libevent 2.0.x, which is by far the majority in the wild.\r\n\r\nI've adapted your approach and added in a few extras which manage to work-around the issue for libevent 2.0.x as well. With this, I'm unable to raise my fd count above the desired ceiling, no matter how hard I hammer.\r\n\r\nPlease have a look here and see what you think: https://github.com/theuni/bitcoin/commits/http-fd-limit. Note that there's an unlikely potential race at shutdown that I haven't yet addressed.",

    "body": "@theuni - your patch looks great! I was cautious about modifying so much.\r\n\r\nGiven the discussion, I've reduced my pull request to the simple improvement of making sure to request as many file descriptors as possible.\r\n\r\nWith @theuni's improvement to only accept connections that have data on, honest HTTP connections will go into the connection limiter. However, I suspect adversaries using things like the slowloris attack (which send incomplete requests and then pause) will not be caught and will use resources. These can be controlled if the libevent request is included, but otherwise can be detected but not perfectly controlled using the approach in the first request, which binds to the rather toothless bevcb callback.\r\n\r\nOne way to look at this is that the root issue is that there is a process wide file-descriptor allocation defined in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/init.cpp#L907 but the RPC interface isn't accounted for. Would be great to integrate @theuni's ConnectionLimiter into that!\r\n\r\nIs it worth defending against slowloris style attacks given the RPC interface is generally not accessible to adversaries?\r\n\r\nIn this pull request, his small change to request as many file-descriptors as possible should help mitigate the original issue on many default configurations (e.g. Ubuntu).",

I think increasing the soft limit is safe and reasonable.",
