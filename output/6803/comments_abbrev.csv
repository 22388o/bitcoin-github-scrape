But I do think an approach like this would work to ""solve"" this problem in 0.10 and 0.11 backports.  The problem with #6673 is there was no limit to how high the fee went, but if its capped at some value that is still potentially reasonable for a min relay fee (like in this",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6803#issuecomment-147128577,147128577,
