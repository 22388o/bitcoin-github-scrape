PPC is not\n+supported because it is big-endian.\n+\n+All of the commands should be executed in a Terminal application. The\n+built-in one is located in `/Applications/Utilities`.\n+\n+Preparation\n+-----------\n+\n+You need to install XCode with all the options checked so that the compiler\n+and everything is available in /usr not just /Developer. XCode should be\n+available on your OS X installation media, but if not, you can get the\n+current version from https://developer.apple.com/xcode/. If you install\n+Xcode 4.3 or later, you'll need to install its command line tools. This can\n+be done in `Xcode > Preferences > Downloads > Components` and generally must\n+be re-done or updated every time Xcode is updated.\n+\n+There's an assumption that you already have `git` installed, as well. If\n+not, it's the path of least resistance to install Github for Mac\n+(OS X 10.7+) or\n+[Git for OS X](https://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/). It is also\n+available via Homebrew or MacPorts.\n+\n+You will also need to install [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/)\n+or [MacPorts](http://www.macports.org/) in order to install library\n+dependencies. It's largely a religious decision which to choose, but, as of\n+December 2012, MacPorts is a little easier because you can just install the\n+dependencies immediately - no other work required. If you're unsure, read\n+the instructions through first in order to assess what you want to do.\n+Homebrew is a little more popular among those newer to OS X.\n+\n+The installation of the actual dependencies is covered in the Instructions\n+sections below.\n+\n+Instructions: MacPorts\n+----------------------\n+\n+### Install dependencies\n+\n+Installing the dependencies using MacPorts is very straightforward.\n+\n+    sudo port install boost db48@+no_java openssl miniupnpc\n+\n+### Building `bitcoind`\n+\n+1. Clone the github tree to get the source code and go into the directory.\n+\n+        git clone git@github.com:bitcoin/bitcoin.git bitcoin\n+        cd bitcoin\n+\n+2.  Build bitcoind:\n+\n+        cd src\n+        make -f makefile.osx\n+\n+3.  It is a good idea to build and run the unit tests, too:\n+\n+        make -f makefile.osx test\n+\n+Instructions: HomeBrew\n+----------------------\n+\n+#### Install dependencies using Homebrew\n+\n+        brew install boost miniupnpc openssl berkeley-db4\n+\n+### Building `bitcoind`\n+\n+1. Clone the github tree to get the source code and go into the directory.\n+\n+        git clone git@github.com:bitcoin/bitcoin.git bitcoin\n+        cd bitcoin\n+\n+2.  Modify source in order to pick up the `openssl` library.\n+\n+    Edit `makefile.osx` to account for library location differences. There's a\n+    diff in `contrib/homebrew/makefile.osx.patch` that shows what you need to\n+    change, or you can just patch by doing\n+\n+        patch -p1 < contrib/homebrew/makefile.osx.patch\n+\n+3.  Build bitcoind:\n+\n+        cd src\n+        make -f makefile.osx\n+\n+4.  It is a good idea to build and run the unit tests, too:\n+\n+        make -f makefile.osx test\n+\n+Creating a release build\n+------------------------\n+\n+A bitcoind binary is not included in the Bitcoin-Qt.app bundle. You can ignore\n+this section if you are building `bitcoind` for your own use.\n+\n+If you are building `bitcoind` for others, your build machine should be set up\n+as follows for maximum compatibility:\n+\n+All dependencies should be compiled with these flags:\n+\n+    -mmacosx-version-min=10.5 -arch i386 -isysroot /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.5.sdk\n+\n+For MacPorts, that means editing your macports.conf and setting\n+`macosx_deployment_target` and `build_arch`:\n+\n+    macosx_deployment_target=10.5\n+    build_arch=i386\n+\n+... and then uninstalling and re-installing, or simply rebuilding, all ports.\n+\n+As of December 2012, the `boost` port does not obey `macosx_deployment_target`.\n+Download `http://gavinandresen-bitcoin.s3.amazonaws.com/boost_macports_fix.zip`\n+for a fix. Some ports also seem to obey either `build_arch` or\n+`macosx_deployment_target`, but not both at the same time. For example, building\n+on an OS X 10.6 64-bit machine fails. Official release builds of Bitcoin-Qt are\n+compiled on an OS X 10.6 32-bit machine to workaround that problem.\n+\n+Once dependencies are compiled, creating `Bitcoin-Qt.app` is easy:\n+\n+    make -f Makefile.osx RELEASE=1\n+\n+Running\n+-------\n+\n+It's now available at `./bitcoind`, provided that you are still in the `src`\n+directory. We have to first create the RPC configuration file, though.\n+\n+Run `./bitcoind` to get the filename where it should be put, or just try these\n+commands:\n+\n+    echo -e \"rpcuser=bitcoinrpc\\nrpcpassword=$(xxd -l 16 -p /dev/urandom)\" > \"/Users/${USER}/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin/bitcoin.conf\"\n+    chmod 600 \"/Users/${USER}/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin/bitcoin.conf\"\n+\n+When next you run it, it will start downloading the blockchain, but it won't\n+output anything while it's doing this. This process may take several hours.\n+\n+Other commands:\n+\n+    ./bitcoind --help  # for a list of command-line options.\n+    ./bitcoind -daemon # to start the bitcoin daemon.\n+    ./bitcoind help    # When the daemon is running, to get a list of RPC commands"
