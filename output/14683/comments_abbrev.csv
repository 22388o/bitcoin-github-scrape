laanwj,2018-11-12T14:28:31Z,"Concept ACKâ€”I think this functionality is very useful\n\nThough I'm not sure about security implications of opening everything that looks like a test directory in `/tmp`, say, on a multi-user system.\n\nMaybe add a check that the directory is owned by the current user as well?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14683#issuecomment-437900823,437900823,

jamesob,2018-11-27T16:09:11Z,"Thanks for the good feedback, all. I've incorporated everyone's suggestions - though I'm testing for tmp directory readability instead of ownership.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14683#issuecomment-442116128,442116128,

practicalswift,2018-11-09T08:05:50Z,Isn't the lambda redundant here? Could use `os.path.getmtime` directly?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14683#discussion_r232167860,232167860,test/functional/combine_logs.py
ryanofsky,2018-11-12T21:53:37Z,"Doesn't hugely matter, but there's no need to build and sort a list if you just want the newest file, e.g.:\n\n```python\nnewest = max((os.path.getmtime(f), f) for f in os.listdir("".""))[1]\n```",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14683#discussion_r232825229,232825229,test/functional/combine_logs.py
jnewbery,2018-11-21T22:26:36Z,nit: can you add `formatter_class=argparse.RawTextHelpFormatter` here. Otherwise the newlines from the docstring get squashed in the help text.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14683#discussion_r235555726,235555726,test/functional/combine_logs.py
jnewbery,2018-11-21T22:35:27Z,I think you can just change this to `parser.parse_args()` and drop the unused variable.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14683#discussion_r235557303,235557303,test/functional/combine_logs.py
jnewbery,2018-11-21T22:38:48Z,"Can you drop this print, or print to stderr.\n\n(printing this is problematic when using the --html output option for example)",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14683#discussion_r235557858,235557858,test/functional/combine_logs.py
MarcoFalke,2018-11-22T17:56:03Z,"Instead of matching just on ""test*"", which is used by other programs (such as our unit test runner, IIRC), couldn't you instead explicitly set a unique (or approximately unique) prefix for the temp folder name in the test framework?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14683#discussion_r235797216,235797216,test/functional/combine_logs.py
laanwj,2018-11-23T09:01:10Z,"maybe match the silly unicode characters as well, they're *very* unlikely to arise anywhere else :)",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14683#discussion_r235875135,235875135,test/functional/combine_logs.py
MarcoFalke,2018-11-23T20:37:59Z,"Oh, the unicode characters are only present when run through the test runner, in which case the tests are run in parallel, so this feature wouldn't turn out useful.\n\nIf the tests are run one-each, they use a different prefix, so I suggest to change that prefix.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14683#discussion_r236016224,236016224,test/functional/combine_logs.py

jnewbery,2018-11-29T15:10:59Z,"Can we remove this dependency? I have a `combine_logs.py` installed in a separate bin directory and it currently works as a standalone util. Adding this dependency breaks that.\n\nPerhaps just directly define `TMPDIR_PREFIX` as `""bitcoin_func_test_""` here. If you want to go wild, you could add a unit test that checks that `TMPDIR_PREFIX` is defined the same in both files.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14683#discussion_r237525319,237525319,test/functional/combine_logs.py
jnewbery,2018-11-29T15:17:52Z,Perhaps also add a comment to warn people against importing from `test_framework` in here (or I can do it in a separate PR).,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14683#discussion_r237528451,237528451,test/functional/combine_logs.py
