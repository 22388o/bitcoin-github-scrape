Every double/float (non-monetary) comes now with a precision of 16 instead of 8 (because of https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6456/files#diff-0f1b401041a14398229cf7e31b6db7eeR89). Because we are using `oss << std::setprecision(16) << val` it will rewrite things like `0.00000000046565423739069247` into scientific notation. That is what @dexX7 has detected.\n",

All numbers were 'cut' to %.8f notation, so it would have reported `0.00000000046565423739069247` as `0.00000000` instead of going to scientific notation.\nE.g. a difficulty smaller than a \"satoshi\" was reported as 0.
