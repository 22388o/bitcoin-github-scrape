laanwj,2017-06-22T13:23:14Z,"I proposed this before but not sure what the outcome of the discussion was - what about making `generate` a wallet method?\nThis means Instead of using the first wallet, could simply use `GetWalletForJSONRPCRequest(request)`.\n(edit: apparently I proposed this in #7965)\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10649#issuecomment-310378553,310378553,
laanwj,2017-06-24T09:10:49Z,"> Seems like a good idea. Would you lose the ability to generate blocks when wallet is disabled (if we even have this ability)?\n\nNo-\n- `generatetoaddress` will work without wallet\n- `generate` needs wallet\n\nSee #10683.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10649#issuecomment-310826959,310826959,
