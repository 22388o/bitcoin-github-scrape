gmaxwell,2014-09-04T21:32:52Z,"I tested out most of the same change last weekend in the hope it would decrease memory usage (it didn't).  I liked the effect on the code (esp, getting rid of the explicit types for a typedef, is 99% of the work here and should be done regardless).\n\nACK (with quasi-testing, I tested my nearly identical changes)\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4838#issuecomment-54548570,54548570,

sipa,2014-09-04T11:11:49Z,"That's not possible. Checkpoints and main are a circular dependency, only possible now because checkpoints.h doesn't need main.h. If the type of mapBlockIndex is defined in main.h, it becomes an actual .h circular dependency.\n\nBetter solution: move the code pieces of checkpoints to main, and the data pieces to chainparams...\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4838#discussion_r17107207,17107207,src/checkpoints.cpp
