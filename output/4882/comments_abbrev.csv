sipa,2014-09-09T23:33:27Z,"@laanwj To conclude: in Bitcoin v0.3.10 (over 4 years ago), the following line was added:\n\n```\n    obj.push_back(Pair(""version"",       (int)VERSION));\n```\n\nwhile VERSION was a static const int already. Since then, the line seems to have been moved and copied many times, but the cast was always kept...\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4882#issuecomment-55052206,55052206,
laanwj,2014-09-10T07:55:27Z,"OK, I'm confused with other RPC casts then. At a certain point someone introduced a lot of them to silence compiler warnings.\n\nIdeally we wouldn't need casts at all by making the JSON value type accept only one integer type (there's no actual need to distinguish them besides possibly signed/unsigned). But it's not worth spending time on that as this will go away when switching to univalue.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4882#issuecomment-55082464,55082464,
