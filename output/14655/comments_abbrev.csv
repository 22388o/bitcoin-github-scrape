ken2812221,2018-11-05T16:04:41Z,">*should* we be using this anywhere?\n\nThe code is unused for a really long time. From the comment that I know that this is to not print debug log to file. The function can be replaced by `gArgs.ForceSetArg` IMO.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14655#issuecomment-435930256,435930256,
MarcoFalke,2018-11-05T16:19:45Z,"It is not meant as a global flag to print to the debug log, but rather a per-message flag to disable the printing for this message.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14655#issuecomment-435936076,435936076,
laanwj,2018-11-06T08:50:05Z,"yes, I think it's fair enough to respond ""no, we have no use for this"", but I have the feeling that you misunderstand what it does.\n@MarcoFalke explains it well.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14655#issuecomment-436175524,436175524,
jonasschnelli,2018-11-07T02:12:10Z,"Somehow this seems to be useful per message flag. I'm don't mind if there is code options we don't use at the moment for future leverage of using it at the right place.\nAgree with @laanwj about the *should*.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14655#issuecomment-436478840,436478840,
ken2812221,2018-11-07T03:00:46Z,Closing. So we can keep this flag for the future sensitive messages that shouldn't be stored in the debug log. It can only be displayed on screen.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14655#issuecomment-436487816,436487816,
