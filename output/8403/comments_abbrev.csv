laanwj,2016-07-26T08:44:37Z,"Agree @sipa.\n""just don't regard them as unknown"" would be the most obvious, and likely best, solution.\nNow you just move them to two other log classes, which get burdened with more messages.\n\nIf you really, really want to log them (say, for debugging purposes) they should be in a separate log class, and the entire processing should be skipped if this log class is not enabled.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8403#issuecomment-235200419,235200419,
