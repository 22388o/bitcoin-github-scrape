    "body": "@sipa  @mcelrath \r\nThis idea is still quite raw, and has changed based on feedback.  It is worthwhile to add a consensus-resolution protocol that is good for; the network, the coin, miners and the environment \u2014 and progress has been made.  Having a consensus for how we form a consensus is delightfully meta.  I am advocating for re-balancing of the incentives created by \"first seen\" and this PR is a step in that direction.\r\n\r\n",
