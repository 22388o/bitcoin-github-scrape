jnewbery,2018-04-10T14:14:31Z,"Concept ACK. A few high-level comments:\n\n- `create_tx_with_size()` is defined, but doesn't seem to be used anywhere.\n- you're doing a lot of manual transaction construction and byte wrangling. Is it possible to use the `CTransaction` class in messages.py to achieve this more easily\n- I much prefer docstrings (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) for commenting functions than a block ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12930#issuecomment-380114569,380114569,
MarcoFalke,2018-04-11T19:55:23Z,"Agree with what @jnewbery already said.\n\n> create_tx_with_size() is defined, but doesn't seem to be used anywhere.\n\nIf the code is not simpler (or faster) or better any other way than the existing code, I see not much reason to review/merge this. Please adjust the call sites to use the new code, so reviewers can get an idea what this is supposed to be replacing.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12930#issuecomment-380576001,380576001,

MarcoFalke,2018-04-11T20:29:04Z,"@conscott I am looking forward to this. (We might be able to speed up the pruning functional test with a version that is optimized for speed, haven't looked if that is actually the bottleneck, though)",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12930#issuecomment-380585343,380585343,
jnewbery,2018-04-11T20:33:59Z,I tried to refactor the pruning test here: #10591 but got bored of rebasing. The original comment in that PR did suggest that constructing large blocks was a bottleneck.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12930#issuecomment-380586731,380586731,
conscott,2018-04-12T06:50:23Z,"Thanks for the suggestion; I will try to use this with the pruning test and see what happens. I won't have time to work for the next few days, which is another reason I chose to close temporarily. Once I get some solid time to test this with large block tests I will definitely re-open :) ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12930#issuecomment-380697331,380697331,
