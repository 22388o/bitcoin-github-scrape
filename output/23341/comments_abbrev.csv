luke-jr,2021-10-29 23:08:42,"Maybe I'm missing the point of it entirely? I'm just saying artificially blocking non-HD wallets from using it seems unreasonable. I can't think of a use case for this with a HD wallet (won't the new keypool just end up with the same keys?), but it seems useful for non-HD wallets to intentionally avoid new funds from being accessible with old (compromised?) backups.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23341#issuecomment-955094261,955094261,
meshcollider,2021-10-30 04:40:59,"HD wallets will be restocked with entirely new keys. That's an interesting use-case, I mainly had in mind people who have upgraded non-HD to HD and want to clear out all their non-HD keys in one go. But I can just add some large warnings in the non-HD case.\n\nIn that case though @luke-jr why not just make a new wallet?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23341#issuecomment-955146799,955146799,
