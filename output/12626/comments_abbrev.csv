sipa,2018-03-07T04:26:22Z,"Since DNS responses generally are sent over UDP, all of them need to fit in a single IP packet (I believe), which puts a natural limit regardless. Having some explicit limit sounds good though.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12626#issuecomment-371018721,371018721,
randolf,2018-03-07T05:47:44Z,"@sipa Packets larger than 512 bytes are supported with the introduction of EDNS (see RFC 6891 dated April 2013; earlier RFCs that reference EDNS0 that may also be of interest) that uses an unsigned 16-bit integer to specify RDLEN (Record Data Length).  Also, while UDP is a MUST for DNS services, TCP is a SHOULD, and both of these transport layer protocols can, for the most part, support EDNS's lar",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12626#issuecomment-371030205,371030205,

EthanHeilman,2018-03-07T14:48:34Z,Three years ago I tested the number of DNS entries I could get into Bitcoin for the eclipse attack paper. My test setup was Ubuntu Linux running Bitcoind querying a custom DNS server on localhost. We didn't end up using this attack so I wrote up a blog entry about the general question without mentioning bitcoin: [How many IP addresses can a DNS query return?](http://ethanheilman.tumblr.com/post/11,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12626#issuecomment-371161810,371161810,
