If you\u2019re going to tell other contributors how to work...\r\n\r\nYou misunderstand me. I wouldn't want to tell other contributors how they have to work, or how they should work. You've expressed frustration with the Travis python linters a few times and i was trying to suggest a method I've used to avoid that frustration. Sorry if it came across as dictating how you should set up your development environment.",

    "body": "> Mostly, the idea of adding this linter was to make sure that we don't get floods of easy PRs of people that have run the linter and found unused dependencies. Removing them is low hanging fruit but not useless enough to NACK immediately, but also detracts people from real review. One of the many of these kinds of things, unfortunately,\r\n\r\n@laanwj That's a fair point -- I agree that reducing maintainer and reviewer burden from those kind of follow-on PRs is valuable as well.",
