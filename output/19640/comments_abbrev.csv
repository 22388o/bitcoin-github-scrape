sdaftuar,2020-08-05 15:44:02,Concept NACK.  I say this in every PR of this type: I don't think it makes sense to change consensus code unless we have some good reason to do so.  See also my recent [comment here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19518#issuecomment-665348923).,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19640#issuecomment-669268831,669268831,
promag,2020-08-05 16:18:47,@sdaftuar it's fine. Just curious if it was intended to pick last element.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19640#issuecomment-669290370,669290370,

theStack,2020-08-02 14:46:04,"This 1-based to 0-based array indexing conversion within the body seems rather odd, why not simply 0-base it right from the start:\n\n```cpp\n        for (int o = block.vtx[0]->vout.size()-1; o >= 0; o--) {\n            const TxOut& vout = block.vtx[0]->vout[o];\n```\n\nDrawback is that the loop counter type has to be changed from `size_t` (unsigned) to `int` signed, but I don't see why tha",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19640#discussion_r464086469,464086469,src/validation.cpp
