MarcoFalke,2019-11-07 15:48:30,"Not sure how useful the general framework is. A smaller patch would be to just copy past the ` BENCHMARK(ComplexMemPool, 1);` line and hardcode the ""asymptotes"". Or if you like, make the benchmark settings dynamic, so that an asymptote can be created by running `bench_bitcoin -filter=... -scale_asymptotes_factor=5` to multiply all dynamic settings in the selected/filtered bench by that factor.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17375#issuecomment-551137840,551137840,
