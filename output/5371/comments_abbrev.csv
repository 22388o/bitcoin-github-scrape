laanwj,2014-11-26T10:01:18Z,"Nice. Everything that shortens the release process is a win, and splitting 32-bit/64-bit/source releases is something that we should have done a long time ago.\n\nACK\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5371#issuecomment-64540254,64540254,

sipa,2014-11-26T15:46:27Z,Any reason why the osx dmg is called '-osx' and not '-osx64' (or even -osx64-setup)?\n< /extremenitpicking >\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5371#issuecomment-64664802,64664802,
