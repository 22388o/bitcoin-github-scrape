MarcoFalke,2018-11-17T17:13:17Z,Unfortunately this file isn't really maintained. Couldn't we remove the help texts and refer everyone to the manpages/`bitcoind -help`?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14740#issuecomment-439632201,439632201,
sp4ke,2018-11-18T18:26:19Z,"@fanquake I amended the commit with the fix. I agree with @MarcoFalke if the file is not maintained it should be refered to the Manpage, it is however usually expected from a standard Debian package to offer an example conf in /usr/share/doc.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14740#issuecomment-439714118,439714118,
laanwj,2018-11-21T10:23:01Z,"I vaguely remember we had a script at some point that generated a sample `bitcoin.conf` from the option help, this would be more convenient than manually maintaining documentation in multiple places.

sp4ke,2018-11-25T02:09:06Z,"I tried looking for the script and could not find it. I am willing to make a new script to generate this file, is it ok to do it in python ? \n\n Also there some sections in the sample conf with more details which are not in the Man, maybe they should moved the Man ?\n\nOn November 21, 2018 11:27:06 AM GMT+01:00, ""Wladimir J. van der Laan"" <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n>BTW this will change w",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14740#issuecomment-441409705,441409705,

sp4ke,2019-04-05T12:05:31Z,@fanquake sorry missed the notifications. I think the best would be to generate the doc from the manpage as previously stated. I will make a PR if I have sometime. It would be great if someone could share previous work done on this task so I can pick it up,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14740#issuecomment-480251227,480251227,
