Is this because we expect the linters to cause false positives and/or to break so often that we need to actively maintain them? If a linter causes false positives, it should simply be removed, period, and I have a hard time seeing a simple shell script breaking very often.\r\n\r\nPersonally I think we should automate anything that can be automated, in order to maintain a clean workspace for everyone. If someone who makes a PR is turned off by having to address automated whine, which is exclusively very simple to do, then chances are they'll be turned off by nits or review anyway.",

The don't-reinclude-in-cpp-what-h-already-includes approach has been in use since #2767 and was made explicit in #10575 with many ACKs. I think that is a very reasonable approach: the .h and .cpp file together are one module, with the .cpp containing the non-public part. The only reason I see for changing that policy is if we want to encourage occasional use of `iwyu`, which AFAIK does not support that policy. However, for now it does not seem very straightforward to use.\r\n\r\n",
