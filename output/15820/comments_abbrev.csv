dongcarl,2019-04-15T17:35:23Z,"Well, they're interactive dummy rebases... Interactive rebases are normally over an updated master if you give it `master` instead of `""$(git merge-base master HEAD)""`.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15820#discussion_r275468797,275468797,doc/productivity.md

dongcarl,2019-04-15T18:37:54Z,"You're right, an interactive rebase is not needed at all on an un-updated master (I hope that's what you meant). I just thought it'd be nice for people to see what the flags do to the rebase TODO list and understand what's going on, but we can remove it for sure. ""Dummy rebase"" is not a proper term, but I've had a use for this trick quite often when working on my git tree so I thought to add it.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15820#discussion_r275492740,275492740,doc/productivity.md
merland,2019-04-16T07:38:07Z,"Thanks for adding this, always nice to take part of useful productivity tips!\nMaybe just me, but could you add something about *why* we ""often want to do a dummy rebase""?

dongcarl,2019-04-16T15:27:20Z,"@instagibbs Well I did think about just adding a ""How to find the last common commit"" trick, but it doesn't really make sense without these two motivating invocations that I find myself doing often...

sipa,2019-04-16T17:10:54Z,"I found the term ""dummy rebase"" confusing as well, but perhaps that's because almost all rebases I do don't actually change the base, so what you're calling a dummy rebase is just what I'd call a git rebase.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15820#discussion_r275903706,275903706,doc/productivity.md
