laanwj,2014-11-03T10:44:24Z,"~~I don't really like the idea of registering and unregistering signals for every `submitblock` call. I don't see any functional issues with this - signals connecting/disconnection is thread-safe - but it's not how signals are supposed to be used. Signal calls are cheap, but connection/disconnection may have a significant overhead.~~ After discussion on IRC: the reason it makes sense this way is t",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5106#issuecomment-61461544,61461544,
