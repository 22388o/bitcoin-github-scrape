jonasschnelli,2015-01-12T10:07:16Z,"I tried to test this but my payment request with a overflow amount was blocked earlier by `if(!BitcoinUnits::parse(BitcoinUnits::BTC, i->second, &rv.amount))` in `guiutil.cpp`.\n\nAny ideas how to test this?\n\nMisses unit test.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5629#issuecomment-69549152,69549152,
Diapolo,2015-01-12T10:09:38Z,"You are aware, that I'm currently in the way of adding a better test-coverage, as also written above :)?\nI'm not at the point where I thought about how to test this special case here...\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5629#issuecomment-69549365,69549365,
jonasschnelli,2015-01-12T10:33:11Z,Yes. I saw that you started writing more tests.\nI just added it into a comment so that we not forget about it.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5629#issuecomment-69551863,69551863,
Diapolo,2015-01-12T10:34:45Z,"Yeah that's good, also if you find an idea on how to test this case fell free to comment again :).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5629#issuecomment-69552033,69552033,
Diapolo,2015-01-13T10:43:50Z,"I guess I can create a payment request which contains an amount, which (when added together) will trigger the new code in here, because if overflows. But for this I need my other related pulls getting merged, as there are currently too many open ones related to payment requests ^^.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5629#issuecomment-69726151,69726151,
jonasschnelli,2015-01-13T11:06:43Z,@Diapolo yes. Understand the step-by-step thing. I tried with a manipulates php script (from gavin). But overflown amounts was already detected in the bitcoin url parsing.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5629#issuecomment-69728776,69728776,

laanwj,2015-02-04T12:31:58Z,"ACK on the checking code.\n\nI'd say we can simplify the reported messages to the user. A user that gets a ""invalid money range"" message has no clue what to do (and neither do translatorws). Let's show a general ""invalid payment request"" message. More details (for developers) will be in the debug log.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5629#issuecomment-72846865,72846865,
