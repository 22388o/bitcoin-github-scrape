fanquake,2014-11-21T09:03:42Z," @laanwj by regenerate doxyfile, I mean I’ve done doxyfile -g, which generates a new default config file, then reapplied our configuration. Our config file now contains all the new doxygen options/docs which have appeared since 1.7.4. I noticed that github doesn’t show the diff, I’m not sure why it wont.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5337#issuecomment-63942722,63942722,
