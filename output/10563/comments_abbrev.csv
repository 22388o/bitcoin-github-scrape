gmaxwell,2017-06-09T01:55:07Z,"Hm! It's not clear if we should be removing this, or making it better, or removing it as a first step in making it better.\n\nI think it's desirable to have your wallet be able to fail-safe when it has detected something awful is going on with the network.  Right now this ability is underused and inconsistent. \n\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10563#issuecomment-307273945,307273945,
achow101,2017-06-09T02:03:29Z,"I should probably be made better, but its current state, IMO, isn't very useful. It only disables a couple of RPC commands in the event of a large fork (and detection of those are apparently broken - see #9443). The wallet itself and the GUI (which most users use) don't actually do anything when safe mode is triggered. All they do is display a warning about the large work fork that it has detected",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10563#issuecomment-307275124,307275124,
