    "body": "I think you underestimate the overhead of a pull request for our project, which has much stricter requirements than some random mobile app.\r\n\r\nOverhead of a pull request\r\n====\r\n\r\n\r\nAny proposed change to Bitcoin Core has to go through the review and merge pipeline on GitHub. Bitcoin Core is a probably the most common fully validating node software out there, so any change to the software needs to be carefully reviewed and tested, regardless how \"trivial\" the change is.\r\n\r\nThis gives a quick overview of the overhead involved when going through the whole merge pipeline.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotification overhead\r\n----\r\n\r\nOpening a pull request or sending a comment on any thread on GitHub will send an email to all people that subscribed to Bitcoin Core activity over GitHub, probably several hundred people. Thus, it makes sense to combine related commits into a single commit or pull request to minimize the notifications overhead. Though, you should still keep the patch set at a reasonable size such that review can be done in one sitting.\r\n\r\n\r\nReview overhead\r\n----\r\n\r\nAny patch needs to be closely reviewed by at least one regular contributor. Even for one line changes, the reviewer needs to recall the whole call graph to check that all edge cases are handled properly. Again, it holds that related change sets should be combined but kept at a size that they still fit into a reviewer's memory.\r\nEven if knowledge of the call graph is not required for review, a contributor still has to review every changed line.\r\n\r\n\r\nArchaeological overhead\r\n----\r\n\r\nAll commits to Bitcoin Core are tracked by the git version control system. This is extremely useful when digging up the history of a change to determine its motivation. However, when the same lines of code get frequently changed, it gets increasingly difficult to determine the original intention of a patch set and reason about the effects of that patch set on the current code base.\r\n\r\n\r\nMaintainability\r\n----\r\n\r\nBefore a commit can be merged, someone must run all unit and functional tests. The commits need to be merged, and the merge commit to be signed and verified. Even though we have scripts to handle most of this pain, it still requires human attention by one of the maintainers.",
