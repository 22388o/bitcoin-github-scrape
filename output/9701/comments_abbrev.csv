jnewbery,2017-03-16T21:45:50Z,"tested ACK. I'd still prefer to see:\n\n- a comment in the docstring about the subtests consuming discrete inputs, and that there should be no shared state between subtests.\n- a comment explaining why epsilon is 1000. What is this testing?\n- the call to count_bytes removed and using the RPC to get size directly.
