It seems like the `--namespace-packages` flag will fix the issue, but it may be easier to just add the empty `__init__.py` file to `test/functional/data` which fixes the problem too.\r\n\r\nTo test this,  I included the `__init__.py` file in the `data` directory and then `mypy test/functional` runs without any errors. Creating an obvious type error inside the `data` package also results in the error being correctly detected.

I tried stuff like `1 + 'test'` to create type errors, but that doesn't work because Mypy assumes everything is untyped unless a function is fully annotated ([Mypy doc](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/common_issues.html#no-errors-reported-for-obviously-wrong-code)). I think this is why running with your config file finds so many errors because the `check_untyped_defs` flag makes Mypy treat everything as typed.",
