    "body": "I agree with @sipa here. Having the split explicit is nice, it makes the linker/compiler enforce sw architecture constraints. I know about `ar` semantics but I don't want it to be possible to accidentally pull in more than necessary (believe me, that's too easy with the current code...).\n\nI expected this concern, that is why I added comments such as `# common: shared between bitcoin-cli, bitcoind, and bitcoin-qt` to the Makefile.\n\nWe may want to rename the libraries to clarify further. If you think `common` implies more than it does after this change, then maybe it should be renamed to `base` or `util` or such! Then keep `common` for the stuff you want to share with the rawtx tool.\n",

    "body": "I agree with @jgarzik's analysis for the most part, but I wasn't going to complain because IMO this particular change doesn't set us back any. Breaking dependencies is crucial, but splitting internal libs is entirely arbitrary until an external api is defined and there is a logical scope for each lib. So while I'm not a fan of combining the libs, it would be no more than a lateral move really.\n\n@sipa's recently merged crypto stuff is a good example of how the libs should be broken up going forward. It has a single scope, a well-defined (though obviously not set-in-stone or exposed at the moment) api, and could be entirely swapped out with a new implementation in the future without changing any usage semantics. Granted that's an overly-simple case, but still example-worthy imo.\n",

And breaking dependencies without having it enforced somehow means it is easy to revert to the previous state. Until there is a well-defined API for the outside world, that's what matters.\n\nAnyhow - I'm going to rename the library with just `chainparamsbase.cpp`, `rpcprotocol.cpp`, `sync.cpp`, `util.cpp` and `version.cpp` to `libbbitcoin_util.a`. These are the utilities and can be included by all tools that need access to bitcoind's configuration and data directory.\n\nI'm going to keep `libbitcoin_common.a` around with the rest of the objects that are now in it (except for those moved to libbitcoin_util). @jgarzik can add the ones he needs from libbitcoin_server for the tx tool.\n",
