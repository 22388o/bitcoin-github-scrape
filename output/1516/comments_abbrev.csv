laanwj,2012-06-25T14:30:52Z,"True, I don't like silent errors/warnings, but the problem is that everyone gets the warnings for all translations every time they build, even though they can't fix them (and if they can they need to do it in transifex anyway). So it was kind of noise.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1516#issuecomment-6548732,6548732,
Diapolo,2012-06-25T14:37:24Z,Removed the noise again and only use it on my local build then :).\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1516#issuecomment-6548904,6548904,
