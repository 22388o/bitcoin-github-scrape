laanwj,2016-08-10T06:53:20Z,"Yes, that makes some sense.\n\nAlthough in the end it depends on where we want to handle wallet enabled/disabled, or ""which and how many wallets to load"" - if we want to handle that externally in the wallet module (if compiled in) then this is a move the wrong way around.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8494#issuecomment-238780943,238780943,

jonasschnelli,2016-08-24T13:24:18Z,"I think this PR is ready.\nThough, long term, we should ""modularize"" CWallet. Which means, `init.cpp` doesn't need to know about the wallet-disable state.\n\nThe only hooks in `init.cpp` should probably be:\n- `CWallet::GetWalletHelpString()`\n- `CWallet::ParameterInteraction()`\n- `CWallet::Verify()`\n- `CWallet::InitLoadWallet()`\n\nand maybe a \n- `CWallet::CleanUp()` in the destructor or shutd",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8494#issuecomment-242061885,242061885,
