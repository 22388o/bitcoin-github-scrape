laanwj,2020-06-18 14:35:47,"Wouldn't it be preferable in this case to not add it in the first place, instead of append `-fno-X` here? Or is it enabled by some umbrella option?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19318#discussion_r442275358,442275358,configure.ac
fanquake,2020-06-18 14:59:02,"I think it's likely we'll end up enabling this, and other flags (for other platforms) in #18921. Progress there has been slow, so I wanted to split this out and just disable it now. It doesn't work, and is causing build failures when testing 18921 and related PRs. I haven't seen it being turned on by an umbrella type option/compiler default yet.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19318#discussion_r442293061,442293061,configure.ac
laanwj,2020-06-18 15:39:24,"What I mean is making the `AC_CHECK_COMPILE_FLAG(…)` to *enable* it conditional on non-windows.\n\nOtherwise you get a gcc overall command line like\n```\nfstack-clash-protection …  … fno-stack-clash-protection\n```\nwhich probably workd but is confusing to see.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19318#discussion_r442320844,442320844,configure.ac
theuni,2020-06-18 22:20:39,"I agree with @wumpus. It sounds like this combo would fail to compile even the most trivial c++ program, so I can't imagine anyone shipping a mingw compiler with this on by default. So proactively turning it of seems like overkill.\n\nInstead, how about for #18921, we add a your minimal test-case as the last (input) param to AX_CHECK_COMPILE_FLAG. That way we don't have to special-case it, and i",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19318#discussion_r442533053,442533053,configure.ac
