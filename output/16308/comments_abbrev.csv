NicolasDorier,2019-06-29 08:37:42,"@sipsorcery I kept the common.proj references, it would be counter intuitive to not have it for all project like we do for common.init.\n\nThat said, I specifically exclude this task from running if we are building a static library.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16308#issuecomment-506940061,506940061,
