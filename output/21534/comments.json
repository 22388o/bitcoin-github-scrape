    "body": "Thanks for this @ccdle12. It goes without saying that I'm very supportive of such changes. `SendMessages()` is a monster. It's very difficult to know whether their are unintended interactions between the different parts of the code. It's also impossible to isolate and test the functionality for the units of code.\r\n\r\n> The idea would be for the changes to eventually look something like this:\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> bool PeerManagerImpl::SendMessages(CNode* pto) {\r\n>     ...\r\n>     {\r\n>         LOCK(cs_main);\r\n>         ...\r\n>         MaybeAnnounceLocalAddress(...);\r\n>         SendAddr(...);\r\n>         SendGetHeadersBlockSync(...);\r\n>         SendBlockAnnouncements(...);\r\n>         SendInv(...);\r\n>         ...\r\n>     }\r\n>     ...\r\n> }\r\n> ```\r\n\r\nOr perhaps even better would be for each peer to have a list of tasks with times, and then pop tasks off the front when the current time has passed the task time. That'd stop us from making many redundant time comparisons in each `SendMessages()` invocation.\r\n\r\nI've already done something very similar to this PR in #21236. Do you mind taking a look at that and seeing if it achieves your goals?",
