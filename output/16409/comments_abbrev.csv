jnewbery,2019-07-18 19:36:18,"@sdaftuar has convinced me. Mempool expiry is a useful feature, if only to protect old nodes from having their mempools permanently filled with transactions that are fail policy for newer nodes. I don't see that the benefit from this PR outweighs the potential risk of old nodes having their mempools filled with effectively unconfirmable txs.\n\nConcept NACK.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16409#issuecomment-512957048,512957048,
