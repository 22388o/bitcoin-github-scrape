theuni,2015-06-01T16:38:48Z,"It my experience testing this, it just did the ""right thing"" tm. Because the old/new .app's use the same identifier, the older one was hidden and only the new one shows. I made sure to test that before ACKing the name change. @jonasschnelli Does the opposite happen for you?\n\n@laanwj To clarify: Usually when you drag an updated .App do Applications, it'll replace the old one.

jonasschnelli,2015-06-01T18:18:02Z,"My concerns are more in a different direction. I think the drag'copy delete'old-app thing is not a big issue. There could be a confusing when one uses spotlight (osx search engine) or when users go over finder directly to the application dir.\n**But:** What made me open a PR for the revert, is, that the name inconsistency over the platforms just feels bad.

jonasschnelli,2015-06-01T12:17:57Z,The os doesn't handle this automatically. We could add something within the QT startup but i think it would be critical and risky. Some users might also like to keep the old version.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6212#discussion_r31419907,31419907,doc/release-notes.md
laanwj,2015-06-01T13:04:33Z,"I agree that is even messier.\nI think the rename we did is a mistake if this means the user needs to do a manual action. People will accidentally keep using the wrong version. We've had this on windows at some point, too.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6212#discussion_r31422836,31422836,doc/release-notes.md
jonasschnelli,2015-06-01T13:19:39Z,"Hmm... right. It is not ideal.\nBut either we rename the app now, with the consequence, that the user needs to delete the old app (now we are in version 0.11 which implies that such things could be necessary) or we keep the name Bitcoin-Qt.app as application bundle name.\nI have to admit that it is inconsistent at the moment (OSX: ""Bitcoin-Core"", win/linux: ""bitcoin-qt"" [name of the runnable appli",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6212#discussion_r31423908,31423908,doc/release-notes.md
jonasschnelli,2015-06-01T13:23:45Z,I think the rename would have only made sense if we had renamed all bitcoin-qt binaries on all platforms (which we disagreed to because this would be to risky and without sense). I create a PR for revert the renaming of the binary (only rename the disk image)\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6212#discussion_r31424198,31424198,doc/release-notes.md
