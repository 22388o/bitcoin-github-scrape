Would make sense to extend the definition of ACKs in `CONTRIBUTING.md` to describe that a tested ACK involves change-specific manual testing, and in case it's not obvious *how* that's done, it should be described in the post.\n\n(not trying to say that running the un",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15617#issuecomment-474773043,474773043,
