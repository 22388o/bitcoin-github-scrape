jgarzik,2019-02-20T17:25:40Z,"> This is effectively moving the type check from the client to the server (unparsable json will get send as string)\n\nAgree.  This matches a common frontend validation pattern:\n\nThe server _must_ validate and reject garbage.  (1) Thus one option is to lean on the remote server to perform that validation.\n\nHowever, it is often better UX -- and potentially saves users $$ in bandwidth, and",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15448#issuecomment-465675580,465675580,
