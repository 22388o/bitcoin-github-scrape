Sjors,2018-07-18T11:58:36Z,The depends README currently shows which `apt` packages to install specifically for those depends. The items here are for the main application.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13702#discussion_r203350179,203350179,doc/build-unix.md

MarcoFalke,2018-08-16T18:29:04Z,"So apparently you can't do it in one go, due to https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gcc-defaults-arm64-cross/+bug/1347820\n\nBut splitting the apt-get into two commands (one for gcc-multilib) and the other for the rest (with their versions removed) should work.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13702#discussion_r210697214,210697214,depends/README.md
MarcoFalke,2018-09-09T18:18:23Z,"You could work around these by splitting the installation into the common dependencies `apt install curl g++-multilib binutils-gold`.
