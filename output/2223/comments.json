    "body": "@luke-jr Without  TX replacement the purpose non-final transactions have is very limit\u2014 the only difference this will make is that you have to transmit them out of band until they lock... which you already had to do if you wanted the ability to replace.\n\nWhat this fixes is that right now the wallet will display transactions that have no conceivable chance of confirming. Unless you have a more detailed understanding of the system and know to look for the impossibly far locktime you'll think that it at least has reasonable odds.  This is misleading and makes Bitcoin even more unsafe for people in practice. Limiting them also closes down some potential areas that DOS vectors could be found.\n\nThe obvious alternatives to outright disabling them\u2014 e.g. relaying transactions only x hours or less before they lock\u2014 turn out to be pretty complicated to implement in the wallet (e.g. what do you do about txn whos parents were above threshold but later fall below it) and don't make an obvious improvement.\n",

Also tested what happens with non-final tx's already in your wallet; an error ends up in your logs and they don't make it into the mempool.
