morcos,2018-01-09T14:23:25Z,"concept ACK\n\nNote: This score was useful for quick approximations for fee estimation and to observe how closely miner policy is matching expectations (as well as possibly coinsviewcache warming).  However none of this has made it into master in a couple years and the goals are probably equally accomplishable by using ancestor_score sorting and skipping entries with ancestors.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12127#issuecomment-356297533,356297533,
TheBlueMatt,2018-01-10T00:42:16Z,"Can we kill CTxMemPool::GetSortedDepthAndScore() and DepthAndScoreComparator, too? I dont see why queryHashes (used to flush fee estimator - this should probably loop over mapTx or something to avoid the needless copy, and getrawmempool output) and infoAll (::MEMPOOL responses and mempool disk-dumping) should be sorted.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12127#issuecomment-356461659,356461659,
sdaftuar,2018-01-10T13:46:50Z,"@TheBlueMatt  I didn't look at the fee estimator usage at all, but we use depth-and-score comparisons for both responding to MEMPOOL requests and for regular transaction relay, to avoid relaying child transactions before parents, which I think is essential behavior.  The sort-by-feerate is imo desirable , if not essential.  I don't think we should get rid of either behavior.\n\nHowever I think w",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12127#issuecomment-356606575,356606575,
