MarcoFalke,2016-04-05T09:14:27Z,So the patch to the fallback logic will fix checksum issues like https://travis-ci.org/bitcoin/bitcoin/jobs/112855470#L831 ?\n\nBut does it also fix the issues where the fallback logic itself appeared to fail?

theuni,2016-04-05T17:17:27Z,"Yes, it should fix both. It broadens the retry logic, so that a ""try"" becomes fetch+validate. If the first try fails, it's retried with the fallback url. In the first example, the download appears to succeed but the checksum doesn't match. Since the download was ""successful"", it doesn't retry. Now it retries the whole thing with the fallback url. A hacked test (i purposely broke the checksum):\n\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7809#issuecomment-205905126,205905126,

theuni,2016-04-08T16:08:37Z,"That's tricky because we don't use the linker directly. It's not specified in depends, because there's no generic way to handle it.

laanwj,2016-04-15T06:54:18Z,"True - we never use `ld` directly, and we shouldn't, for example it would be quite annoying to figure out what the linker is (and what plugin it is using - turns out it is loading `/opt/clang39/lib/LLVMgold.so`) in my lto setup testing the clang master branch:\n\n```\n   CC=""${CLANGPATH}/bin/clang "" \n   CXX=""${CLANGPATH}/bin/clang++"" \n   CFLAGS=""-flto -O2 -g"" CXXFLAGS=""-flto -O2 -g"" LDFLAGS=""-fl",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7809#discussion_r59833398,59833398,depends/Makefile
