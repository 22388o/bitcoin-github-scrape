JoelKatz,2011-07-24T07:03:40Z,"All of my micro-optimizations are a result of benchmarking. The map access is fast in the sense that it scales well even if there are a large number of entries in the map. It is, however, slow if the map is very small. (In fairness, my benchmark was hitting the client with massive numbers of RPC requests.)\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/426#issuecomment-1640037,1640037,
JoelKatz,2011-07-24T07:36:49Z,"Latest patches add much faster HexStr and faster Base64 decode. These changes were made based on profiling. Again, the profiled workload was large numbers of RPC requests, primarily 'getwork'. So they primarily benefit controllers for pooled mining. (See the Bitcoin forums, several large pools are using these patches.)\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/426#issuecomment-1640087,1640087,
JoelKatz,2011-07-25T19:22:09Z,"While people who do large numbers of 'getwork' requests are certainly minority users of the code in terms of number of installations, they have a disproportionate affect on things like which transactions wind up in the public hash chain. They will need optimizations to the RPC/JSON/getwork paths. The issue is whether those optimizations will be maintained as a fork or merged into the mainline.
