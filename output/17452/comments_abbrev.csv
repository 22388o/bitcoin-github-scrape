MarcoFalke,2019-11-12 14:08:49,"This is a folder, as opposed to the ` src/test/test_bitcoin_fuzzy` binary.\n\nI am not sure if the whole folder should be excluded. Also I am not sure if it makes sense to enumerate all binaries one-by-one.\n\nNo strong opinion, though. I don't really care about gitignore.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17452#discussion_r345224216,345224216,.gitignore

I don't really care about gitignore.\n\nOut-of-tree builds ftw.\n\nBut I think as long as we're enumerating binaries here, we should add them all.

kallewoof,2020-01-03 09:26:06,Suggest adding `!src/test/fuzz/*.*` below this line to re-watch anything with an extension. This on its own would start ignoring even `.cpp/.h` files in that folder.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17452#discussion_r362745616,362745616,.gitignore
jonatack,2020-01-03 09:27:14,Agreed! I was hesitant between just removing `src/test/test_bitcoin_fuzzy` or adding the unignore. ,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17452#discussion_r362745983,362745983,.gitignore
