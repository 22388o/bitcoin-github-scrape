laanwj,2013-04-15T06:08:09Z,"possible pointer leak here: when is the MacDocIconHandler freed? Does its scope extend beyond that of the main window? If so, you should do setMainWindow(NULL) in the destructor.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2530#discussion_r3788699,3788699,src/qt/bitcoingui.cpp
jonasschnelli,2013-04-15T06:16:51Z,"It's a singleton, ... it probably never gets freed during by the app itself.\nBut i just added this->mainWindow = NULL; in the destructor.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2530#discussion_r3788738,3788738,src/qt/bitcoingui.cpp
laanwj,2013-04-15T08:01:41Z,I think you misunderstand me. What I mean is to set the mainwindow of your\nsingleton to NULL in the destructor of the _MainWindow_. This prevents a\nstale pointer in your singleton after MainWindow is freed but the singleton\nstill lives.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2530#discussion_r3789454,3789454,src/qt/bitcoingui.cpp
jonasschnelli,2013-04-15T10:03:47Z,"Ah. Clear. Your right. Did update the code.\nBut i think the destructor of BitcoinGUI never gets called during the runtime.\nBut yes, the pointer MUST be set to NULL.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2530#discussion_r3790945,3790945,src/qt/bitcoingui.cpp
laanwj,2013-04-15T10:21:40Z,"The destructor of BitcoinGUI gets called when the object goes out of scope.\nFeel free to verify this and prove me wrong (this would be a bug).\n\nThe proper idiom here would be a ""weak pointer"". But explicitly setting it\nto null to prevent a dangling pointer is ok.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2530#discussion_r3791102,3791102,src/qt/bitcoingui.cpp
