jonasschnelli,2014-11-17T15:34:31Z,I also don't like it.\nBut i like it more than useless burn cpu.\nIt would bring back the possibility of a AppNapping and a Network-Disabling-Switch (some people might do the same like i do and block bitcoin-qt traffic with soft-firewalls to prevent cpu/network-bandwidth while on the go).\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5296#issuecomment-63321998,63321998,
Diapolo,2014-11-17T18:29:28Z,Is there a patch ready from Qt upstream that could be used during the build? I know we already include some patches during build time.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5296#issuecomment-63350920,63350920,
jonasschnelli,2014-11-18T08:38:59Z,@Diapolo i did search for a qt patch but could nothing found. I also followed the idea of writing a qt patch (root cause fixing) but didn't succeed.\n\nI just think we owe the user a more or less bug free bitcoin-qt client. This pull does not follow a state of the art architecture but makes the enduser experience better.\n\nI try now to move it to `guiutil` and try to follow sipa's advice with the,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5296#issuecomment-63437701,63437701,
jonasschnelli,2014-11-18T09:00:25Z,"@sipa i just implemented `typedef` ""switch"". But IMO it more unclear then. I would recommend to keep it as it was with the `#ifdef` directly while instantiating the object.
