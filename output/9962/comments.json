We just don't have the resources to handle this, and the overhead for a github PR is too large, they are supposed to be for major, self-contained changes.\r\n\r\nWhat we could do is create a tracking PR:\r\n\r\n- Assign one person as \"typo fixer\", and have them open a \"report typos here!\" PR\r\n\r\n- People can report typos, or patches fixing a typo in that PR.\r\n\r\n- The typo-fixer pulls these suggested changes (or any typos they find themselves) into their PR.\r\n\r\nThen once in [some period of time] this pull is merged.\r\nThis allows live cooperation on fixing typos without involving the maintainers at every step.",

    "body": "It is surely not about me... In the past, we have tried it in @theuni's tree. Closing PRs here, opening them in his own tree, rebasing, PRing the complete batch etc. This is a lot of work for one person. I was talking about this overhead.\r\n\r\nMuch easier to do that here because people will do that here anyway (reading source code/forking is so easy in github...). Yes, there is some overhead for your two. I can't help with merging but I try to help with reviewing such PRs because I understand it slows down your work elsewhere.\r\n",
