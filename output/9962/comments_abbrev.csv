laanwj,2017-03-09T11:58:59Z,"Agree with @MarcoFalke . In principle it is good to fix comment typos, but my preference too would be to either catch them at the source (review the PR and find them) so that they never get merged in the first place or bunch them up into something like a ""fix typos"" pull every few weeks.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9962#issuecomment-285332911,285332911,

We just don't have the resources to handle this, and the overhead for a github PR is too large, they are supposed to be for major, ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9962#issuecomment-285334709,285334709,
paveljanik,2017-03-09T13:56:17Z,"Sorry, but I do not see how e.g. this PR had ""too large overhead"" (modulo typo in the commit message 8). It was merged within 3 hours after its opening. This is perfect!\n\nWe already tried your suggestion but it didn't work. The management burden of it is too large for one person. And we can't teach newcomers to report/PR the typo fix *elsewhere*. This is not how it works.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9962#issuecomment-285357260,285357260,
laanwj,2017-03-09T15:51:38Z,"You can argue but do realize that @MarcoFalke and me are the only two maintainers that merge these kind of patches at all. And we agree on this. You can assume that we know what we're talking about.  In a critical project like this a certain amount of care has to be taken for merging each PR, we can't blindly merge everything with ""typo"" in the name.
