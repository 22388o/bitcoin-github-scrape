With IsMine() I could check if this transaction belongs to my addresses. Then, I would have to to query the wallet to give me all transaction details for every transaction which is mine in the block I currently processed.\n\nI'm not sure if this would be more efficient because I thought json-rpc-",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2579#issuecomment-19208875,19208875,
