TheBlueMatt,2011-05-05T21:54:14Z,I'm getting kind of tired of explaining this.  USE_UPNP=1 means UPnP is on by default.  USE_UPNP=0 means UPnP is compiled in and off by default.  If you undefine USE_UPNP by building with USE_UPNP=  UPnP is not compiled in any the errors go away.  Please do a bit of searching before submitting bug/pull requests.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/196#issuecomment-1108453,1108453,
