fanquake,2018-10-10T02:15:16Z,@dongcarl can you comment on how this overlaps with #12255,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14442#issuecomment-428414532,428414532,
dongcarl,2018-10-10T02:37:20Z,"@fanquake It seems somewhat orthogonal to what I was doing in #12255, this commit seems to want to have `systemd` handle the daemonizing of `bitcoind`, whereas my change explicitly configures the pid file location such that `systemd` has a way to reach `bitcoind`. I am fine with either approach, and will rebase my commit sometime.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14442#issuecomment-428417968,428417968,
