rebroad,2016-08-29T08:08:29Z,"@paveljanik I do.. but not enough sometimes. I'm a premature pusher it seems :-s\n\nAlso, as soon as I am happy with my code, I want to push it to my github account, but if I do that while the pull is closed, then I'm unable to re-open it, so I have to open it before pushing. But if I leave it open, other developers on github complain if it's not read enough, which sometime it isn't, so I close it",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8622#issuecomment-243059392,243059392,
MarcoFalke,2016-08-29T08:13:08Z,@rebroad Leave it open or leave it closed. You already included the [WIP] tag.\n\nOtherwise you are sending out about 1200 emails every time you click the button.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8622#issuecomment-243060270,243060270,
rebroad,2016-08-29T08:16:44Z,"@MarcoFalke ok, I will find a better way to do this. Does changing the title also send as many emails? I don't even feel having conversation via comments is the best way either - is there no private messaging function on github for example?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8622#issuecomment-243060961,243060961,
sipa,2016-08-29T08:21:36Z,"Pushing a commit to a PR, changing the title, opening, closing, ... all\nsend mails. And people who are subscribed to the project receive all these\nmails from all pull requests.\n\nIf you want to actively experiment, why not work in a separate branch,\nwithout a PR? Once you're happy with the result, you can push the PR'ed\nbranch.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8622#issuecomment-243061871,243061871,
btcdrak,2016-08-29T10:00:25Z,@rebroad I also suggest popping into IRC to ask questions/sound ideas. It's a lot more efficient to get direction and focus.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8622#issuecomment-243084034,243084034,

rebroad,2016-09-01T07:09:17Z,"It seems to me that nServicesExpected doesn't need to be mentioned here at all. It's irrelevant. It's simply what was advertised in the addresses messages. If nServices includes all the relevant services then surely the connection should remain. Firstly, the network selection code is such that if the relevant services wasn't present in ExpectedServices it wouldn't even have tried connecting to it.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8622#discussion_r77123930,77123930,src/main.cpp
