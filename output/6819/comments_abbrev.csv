theuni,2015-10-13T17:35:07Z,"@luke-jr I'm not aware of anyone running the tests against libzmq dll's via mingw either.

theuni,2015-12-04T04:50:46Z,I'm not familiar enough with zmq to know how helpful it is in Windows. My hunch is that the overlap would be small enough to ignore until someone willing/able to test comes along.\n\nI'd rather that than blindly enable it and risk untested codepaths.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6819#issuecomment-161876459,161876459,
laanwj,2015-12-04T08:50:44Z,"OK, yes, zmq on windows doesn't seem like a very common use-case. Thanks for the explanation.\n\n(I'm not even convinced it should be enabled in any releases by default, I mean it has to statically link zmq instead of use the one on the system, which may be incompatible in practice)\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6819#issuecomment-161910754,161910754,
