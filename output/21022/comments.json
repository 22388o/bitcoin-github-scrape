That's resolve this particular issue at least (though not the wider discussion around glibc versions).\r\n\r\n> Without looking at the code (assuming it wouldn't require a redesign), this seems like a reasonable temporary punt. \r\n\r\nI think this is actually very reasonable. The shared_mutex in the sigcache was introduced in ef0f422519de4a3ce47d923e5f8f90cd12349f3e. @sipa's commit log:\r\n\r\n>     Remove contention on signature cache during block validation\r\n>    \r\n>     Since block validation happens in parallel, multiple threads may be\r\n>     accessing the signature cache simultaneously. To prevent contention:\r\n>     * Turn the signature cache lock into a shared mutex\r\n>     * Make reading from the cache only acquire a shared lock\r\n>     * Let block validations not store their results in the cache\r\n\r\nI believe that since #10192 was merged, block validation will now very rarely use the signature cache. From that PR:\r\n\r\n> This is somewhat duplicative with the sigcache, as entries in the\r\n> new cache will also have several entries in the sigcache. However,\r\n> the sigcache is kept both as ATMP relies on it and because it\r\n> prevents malleability-based DoS attacks on the new higher-level\r\n> cache. Instead, the -sigcachesize option is re-used - cutting the\r\n> sigcache size in half and using the newly freed memory for the\r\n> script execution cache.\r\n\r\nIf the only use for sigcache is now in ATMP (which is single-threaded and requires cs_main), then changing this to a simple mutex wouldn't have any impact on performance. I don't understand the \"prevents malleability-based DoS attacks on the new higher-level cache\" part of @TheBlueMatt's description so I may be missing something subtle here.",
