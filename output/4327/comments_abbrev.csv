Diapolo,2014-06-11T12:45:46Z,"SOCKS5 exists since 1996, so SOCKS4 is even older... I remember @sipa expressed he would like to get rid of it some time ago, so I decided to do it. Also most current SOCKS servers should handle SOCKS5 just fine (+ it allows a much cleaner proxy setup in our code).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4327#issuecomment-45735862,45735862,
laanwj,2014-06-11T12:49:28Z,True - I can't think of anything that still uses SOCKS4. SOCKS5 is also safer as it allows DNS lookups over the proxy.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4327#issuecomment-45736246,45736246,

laanwj,2014-06-16T06:33:54Z,"I haven't had any replies to my post, so I assume it's not very important. No one is crying that SOCKS4 is going to go.\n\nAnyhow, how is the error handling? it should at least fail with an error if the user still specifies a SOCKS4 proxy, instead of silently doing anything nefarious like bypass the proxy.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4327#issuecomment-46145059,46145059,
