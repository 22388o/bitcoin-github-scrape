jl2012,2016-08-19T10:03:52Z,I think more work is needed before we could consider making this as default:\n1. Miners need to select transaction in a more intelligent way. They should have the ability to drop dust inputs in order to maximize the fee with limited block space.\n2. A bigger problem is it will make the txid malleable and confuse users.
