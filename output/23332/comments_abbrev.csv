laanwj,2021-10-21 18:56:55,Could rename `s` to `status` here as well,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23332#discussion_r733964670,733964670,src/wallet/transaction.h
laanwj,2021-10-21 19:02:16,I think this comment is slightly confusing. There are no `block_hash` and `block_index` parameters. Maybe add `confirm.` in front?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23332#discussion_r733968468,733968468,src/wallet/wallet.h
MarcoFalke,2021-10-21 20:14:03,Done,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23332#discussion_r734013720,734013720,src/wallet/transaction.h
MarcoFalke,2021-10-21 20:14:33,I've removed the comment. `CWalletTx::Confirmation` is self-explanatory in that regard.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23332#discussion_r734014057,734014057,src/wallet/wallet.h

MarcoFalke,2021-10-26 09:46:02,"If you think this is important to explain, it might be better to put the comment to `TxStateConfirmed` from #21206?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23332#discussion_r736350529,736350529,src/wallet/wallet.h
