promag,2018-02-05T17:00:53Z,"utACK 875d62f.\n\nIt would be nice to add tests for `mempool min fee not met` and `mempool full` errors, it's the missing cases of `REJECT_INSUFFICIENTFEE`.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12356#issuecomment-363149029,363149029,
Empact,2018-02-07T03:55:25Z,I added a change to include the full FormatStateMessage output in RPC errors that are currently including just the reason or reason + code. That would include the missing debug output that comes up e.g. in #11955,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12356#issuecomment-363649177,363649177,

promag,2018-02-15T15:45:42Z,utACK bb00c95. Thanks for the commit reorder @Empact.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12356#issuecomment-365967363,365967363,
promag,2018-02-08T10:18:43Z,I believe you can set `feeRate` option in `fundrawtransaction` instead.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12356#discussion_r166887156,166887156,test/functional/mempool_limit.py
promag,2018-02-08T10:21:20Z,"I guess there is no need to assert this, `sendrawtransaction` above failed. This `assert` makes sense when testing `sendrawtransaction` failure, so move it there if it's missing.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12356#discussion_r166887791,166887791,test/functional/mempool_limit.py
Empact,2018-02-08T16:03:54Z,"Fair enough, removed that and generally simplified the test.\n\nFyi I was following the example set in: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/test/functional/mining_prioritisetransaction.py#L124",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12356#discussion_r166982005,166982005,test/functional/mempool_limit.py
MarcoFalke,2018-02-22T21:14:01Z,"The transaction is created non-deterministically, thus you can't hardcode the exact value here.\n\nSee for example the following failure (off-by-two):\n\n```\nAssertionError: Expected substring not found:mempool min fee not met, 166 < 409 (code 66)",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12356#discussion_r170094948,170094948,test/functional/mempool_limit.py
Empact,2018-02-22T21:27:03Z,"Ok, will send up a fix shortly.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12356#discussion_r170098198,170098198,test/functional/mempool_limit.py
