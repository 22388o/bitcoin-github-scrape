laanwj,2016-03-31T13:13:51Z,Needs rebase. I agree moving the `CTxMemPool::removeForReorg` function seems unnecessary.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7574#issuecomment-203931359,203931359,
jtimon,2016-03-31T15:06:43Z,"+1 nack on moving CTxMemPool::removeForReorg for no apparent reason.\nI have mixed feelings about this. On one hand, I kind of hate default values for params (like flags=-1) and this has some nice cleanups. On the other hand, I would like to be more explicit about flags everywhere, not less.\nI've been saying this multiple times in ""random"" places, but...can't we just move LOCKTIME_VERIFY_SEQUENCE",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7574#issuecomment-203978923,203978923,
NicolasDorier,2016-03-31T15:23:38Z,"rebased, @jtimon I'm not sure what you mean by ""moving removeForReorg"" ? can you check again ?\nThe big diff just before was just a problem of diff presentation I think, I did not attempt to move anything.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7574#issuecomment-203985181,203985181,

jtimon,2016-03-31T17:02:05Z,"@NicolasDorier I meant what @laanwj (and I would swear someone else before him, but I can't see the ""Someone commented on an outdated diff"" thing) said (that CTxMemPool::removeForReorg was being moved unnnecessarly [and probably unintentionally too]).

NicolasDorier,2016-03-31T17:06:40Z,@jtimon I think the problem was the way github presented the diff. I never intended to move a function. Somehow the rebase fixed it.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7574#issuecomment-204024876,204024876,
jtimon,2016-03-31T17:22:58Z,"Oh, I was complaining about github's traceability, but maybe we don't want to keep traceability of their bugs, only ours (not saying that accidentally moving a function was a bug if that had been the case).

morcos,2016-03-31T17:47:01Z,"I'm in favor of cleaning up these flags, but I'm not sure this is the right approach.\n\nProbably something along the lines of what @jtimon is suggesting where there is just one set of consensus flags that are used would be better.  \n\nI think we still want to pass flags to CheckFinalTx because we might want to preserve a way of accepting non-MTP locktime txs in the mempool.
