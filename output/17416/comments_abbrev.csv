MarcoFalke,2019-11-08 13:48:53,Would it be possible and easier to put the install script into a separate file and invalidate the cache when that script changes?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17416#issuecomment-551822592,551822592,
sipsorcery,2019-11-08 14:05:43,"@MarcoFalke yep I'm pretty sure that would be possible. My concern would be starting down the path of an elaborate multi-script build config. That could get scary for us Windows devs.\n\nIs the main goal to have a way of triggering updates without having to touch the appveyor config? What do you think about something simpler like putting the list of packages in a separate text file?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17416#issuecomment-551840091,551840091,
MarcoFalke,2019-11-08 14:21:05,"The installation step is already a separate (one-line) script in `build_msvc/README.md`, so moving it to a file (or just the list of packages to a file) wouldn't make it worse. Also, it moves the hard coded required packages names to a single place.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17416#issuecomment-551845682,551845682,
