vasild,2021-03-15 15:40:32,"This is impossible to reuse if another `FUZZ_TARGET()` be added. It is ok since here we have just one `FUZZ_TARGET()` and if _ever_ another one is added and reuse needed, then it could be done in another way.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21443#discussion_r594448399,594448399,src/test/fuzz/netbase_dns_lookup.cpp
practicalswift,2021-03-15 15:47:49,"I think (and hope) that the `netbase_dns_lookup` fuzzing harness should cover all our low-level DNS fuzzing needs, so I think the probability that we'll need to call `fuzzed_dns_lookup_function` from another `FUZZ_TARGET` in the future is relatively low.\n\nIn other words: let's cross that fuzzing bridge when we come to it :)",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21443#discussion_r594455032,594455032,src/test/fuzz/netbase_dns_lookup.cpp
