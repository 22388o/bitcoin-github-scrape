mzumsande,2021-10-27 23:17:23,"The proposed change would also mean that it would now be possible to prune up to the best block of an index without needing to reindex (+1 block compared to master). I hope I'm not missing something, but I don't see why we still need the full data of `block->pprev` in the case where `block` is the best block of the index and `block->pprev`  was indexed in the past.\nI added a test for this edge c",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23365#issuecomment-953378550,953378550,

mzumsande,2021-11-26 15:43:40,"> The `block = block->pprev;` does make me a little nervous (although as-written the code would never cause any problems given how we initialize `block_to_test`), so if you wanted to you could include an assertion like\n\nThanks - I added the assertion as suggested, and rebased. Note that adding the assert only changes the kind of error: Before, if `block->pprev` had not existed (which I agree s",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23365#issuecomment-980067148,980067148,

mzumsande,2021-11-09 10:09:37,Because preventing disconnections due to NODE_NETWORK_LIMITED_MIN_BLOCKS makes little sense  when there is just one node involved in the test. ,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23365#discussion_r745466739,745466739,test/functional/feature_blockfilterindex_prune.py
