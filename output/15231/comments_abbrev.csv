ken2812221,2019-01-23T08:30:01Z,I think that this would require to define _WIN32_WINNT=0x0601 (Windows 7) at first. Otherwise the mingw would consider the minimum OS version should be supported is Windows XP SP1 ( _WIN32_WINNT=0x0502) by default. ref #14922 ,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15231#issuecomment-456713275,456713275,
Empact,2019-01-23T09:30:55Z,"@ken2812221 Seems this is working despite the version not being set, thanks to the shim in compat.h, but I suspect we can remove that if we set the `_WIN32_WINNT` version.
