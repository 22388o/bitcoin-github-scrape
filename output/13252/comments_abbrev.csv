Empact,2018-05-17T02:11:14Z,"Based on work by luke-jr, #9537\n\nIncidental changes relative to that work:\n* Return bool rather than throw, because this is a common failure mode, so its handling is control flow\n* Extract `use_split_keypool` bool to make ""keypool entry misclassified"" case more straightforward\n* throw rather than assert on `keypool.vchPubKey.IsValid()`, to simplify docs and create an opportunity for hand",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13252#issuecomment-389722061,389722061,
