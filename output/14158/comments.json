I love your work on `libtorrent` and I'm also a fan of your C++ talks.\r\n\r\nThe high quality standards you strive for in the `libtorrent` project and enforce by use of automated testing/linting is really impressive. Thanks for some really inspiring work and hope you'll bring some of that drive for high quality and correctness over here in the form of future contributions!\r\n\r\nWelcome to Bitcoin Core! :-)",

I believe it's widely understood that all major compilers these days ignore the hint and base inlining entirely on their own heuristics. It's a fair concern though. I'll see what I can come up with. Are there any performance regression tests by any chance?",

    "body": "I put some work into investigating whether any of the inline decisions changed by this patch. Given that it's primarily decided by heuristics, this may differ on GCC. I tested this with clang using the `-Rpass=inline` command line switch. This logs every time the inliner fires.\r\n\r\nSpecifically I ran:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCFLAGS=-Rpass=inline ./configure\r\nmake V=1 -j1 2> master-inlining.log\r\ngrep \"remark:\" -A 3 master-inlining.log >master.log\r\n```\r\n\r\nand then the same thing in this branch (after cleaning obviously):\r\n\r\n```\r\nmake V=1 -j1 2> branch-inlining.log\r\ngrep \"remark:\" -A 3 branch-inlining.log >branch.log\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy hope was that the output would be identical, but it wasn't for various reasons. However, all the actual inline decisions were the same. The difference was that some names were mangled differently (presumably because of the linkage change) and some logs quoting lines in the source changed, because the source changed.\r\n\r\nfor example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n-./primitives/transaction.h:404:116: remark: _ZNSt3__17forwardI19CMutableTransactionEEOT_RNS_16remove_referenceIS2_E4typeE inlined into _Z18MakeTransactionRefI19CMutableTransactionENSt3__110shared_ptrIK12CTransactionEEOT_ [-Rpass=inline]\r\n+./primitives/transaction.h:404:130: remark: _ZNSt3__17forwardI19CMutableTransactionEEOT_RNS_16remove_referenceIS2_E4typeE inlined into _ZL18MakeTransactionRefI19CMutableTransactionENSt3__110shared_ptrIK12CTransactionEEOT_ [-Rpass=inline]\r\n```\r\n(note the additional \"L\" in the mangled name)\r\n\r\n```\r\n-template <typename Tx> CTransactionRef MakeTransactionRef(Tx&& txIn) { return std::make_shared<const CTransaction>(std::forward<Tx>(txIn)); }\r\n-                                                                                                                   ^\r\n+template <typename Tx> static inline CTransactionRef MakeTransactionRef(Tx&& txIn) { return std::make_shared<const CTransaction>(std::forward<Tx>(txIn)); }\r\n+                                                                                                                                 ^\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, at least for for clang, this patch does not change any inlining decisions.",
