laanwj,2016-09-20T15:41:20Z,"This is indeed wrong (see discussion in #8765) but I don't think this is the right solution:\n- The ThreadFlushDB is misnamed, it is not a flushing thread but a compaction/consolidation thread.\n- There is no need to trigger a db compaction at this point. A normal `cwallet->Flush()` would do, if you want an explicit flush here.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8687#issuecomment-248340984,248340984,

I assumed since this is removing data, compacting might be desirable to ensure it gets removed entirely.\n\nThat's a good point in itself, however this is a very slow operation with a large wallet, so doing it after every command is non-optimal.\n\nAlso, although I called it 'compaction' it does not have any guarantee of getting rid of old data. It just consolidates",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8687#issuecomment-248518435,248518435,
