So an alternative could be to enable it by default for regtest. Though, the current patch is already a clear improvement.\n\nFor reference the help text of the bool arg:\n\n```\n  -checkblockindex\n       Do a full co",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13912#issuecomment-411479137,411479137,
domob1812,2018-08-08T17:34:11Z,"I agree with @MarcoFalke - ideally, these checks should be enabled for `regtest` net automatically, similar to the mempool checks.
