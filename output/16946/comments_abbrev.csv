luke-jr,2019-11-03 02:18:09,"> a wallet flag set indicating that. The presence of the wallet flag lets us skip the full decryption as if fDecryptionThoroughlyChecked were true.\n\nWhat happens if I open with new version, then switch back to an old version, generate some new keys, then switch back to the new?\n\nIs a wallet flag really needed at all? Shouldn't verifying checksums also reveal if there are checksums missing?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16946#issuecomment-549098459,549098459,

achow101,2019-12-04 00:26:06,"I've rebased onto master and included #17369 as a prerequisite. I've also reworked it according to @luke-jr's suggestions. Instead of a wallet flag, we reuse `fDecryptionThoroughlyChecked` to let as avoid the decryption check. This also makes it easier for us to write (or rewrite) the checksums if they don't exist (or are invalid).",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16946#issuecomment-561418877,561418877,
