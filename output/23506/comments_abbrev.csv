dongcarl,2021-11-22 18:40:27,@hebasto Did you look into if it'd be possible to do relative to script path? I'm seeing on the man page that you can use a `source-path` directive? I'm just thinking it might make it easier if we were to rename directories in the future to not have to touch all the `source=` directives ,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23506#issuecomment-975813462,975813462,
