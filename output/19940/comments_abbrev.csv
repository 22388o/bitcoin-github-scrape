glozow,2020-09-11 14:12:35,I should update this now that it'd be a different PR number. Will incorporate with any review comments so feel free to nit :),https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19940#discussion_r487072717,487072717,doc/release-notes.md
instagibbs,2020-09-11 15:06:27,"I'd rather the vsize was computed rather than hard-coded. Should be simple enough to make a helper function to do this in python, and would be nice to use for tests going forward.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19940#discussion_r487108415,487108415,test/functional/mempool_accept.py
instagibbs,2020-09-11 15:08:08,Can we also try to make these fee calculations more programmatic? Otherwise it's a burden on future test writers.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19940#discussion_r487109473,487109473,test/functional/mempool_accept.py

MarcoFalke,2020-09-19 07:37:02,why does this need to truncate the digits of the btc amount?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19940#discussion_r491314005,491314005,test/functional/mempool_accept.py
MarcoFalke,2020-09-19 07:38:14,unrelated nit: What happens if `fee` was made a `Decimal` as opposed to `float` when defined?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19940#discussion_r491314390,491314390,test/functional/mempool_accept.py
MarcoFalke,2020-09-19 07:39:45,"Same\n\n(This is my fault for using float in the first place, but now that Decimal is imported, might as well use it everywhere)",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19940#discussion_r491314844,491314844,test/functional/mempool_accept.py
