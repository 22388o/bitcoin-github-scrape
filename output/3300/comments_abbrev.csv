laanwj,2013-11-22T03:10:11Z,That's not what I would call a minor typo cleanup. Why are you removing this check?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3300#discussion_r7847239,7847239,src/main.cpp
lian,2013-11-22T03:47:15Z,please see the commit message for that change: https://github.com/lian/bitcoin/commit/1331ee88867459d34c953c1cb688b51c674b2d96\n\nblock.vtx.empty() is already checked 3 lines above in that same method.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3300#discussion_r7847638,7847638,src/main.cpp

lian,2013-11-22T18:22:18Z,"its a seperate commit already, but i guess you mean pull request.\n\ni don't see whats the issue with this change, its just git diffs fault for not showing more than 5 lines so everyone freaks out with just seeing the deleted part.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3300#discussion_r7863971,7863971,src/main.cpp
laanwj,2013-11-23T08:14:28Z,"There is nothing wrong with the change itself @lian.\nBut CheckBlock is one of the most critical functions in the client. \nSo we're (understandably, I hope) a bit baffled to see a change to it in a pull request called ""Minor typo cleanup"".\nIf you want to suggest changes to this function, please do it as a separate pull request with an appropriate name, so that the right people will look at it.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3300#discussion_r7874867,7874867,src/main.cpp
