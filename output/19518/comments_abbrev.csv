roconnor-blockstream,2020-07-14 17:51:07,"My personal motivation is that I was trying to interpret the locktime rules in order to work with them.  I replicated the logic as it was written here originally, but upon reflection it seemed unnecessarily complex.  I cleaned up the logic in my own work and thought I might as well suggest the same clean up for Bitcoin Core while I was on the topic.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19518#issuecomment-658321915,658321915,
