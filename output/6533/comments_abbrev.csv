Mirobit,2015-08-07T20:50:21Z,"NACK, with a declining number of nodes we shouldn't put more pressure on them.\nNot sure what you mean with quality of the internet. Number of nodes is the relevant factor here.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6533#issuecomment-128831482,128831482,
rnicoll,2015-08-07T21:06:05Z,"NACK at least without any analysis of impact on block propagation and bandwidth usage. Nodes relay (I believe) to all connections concurrently, so they'd be spreading upstream bandwidth even more thinly with this patch.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6533#issuecomment-128834165,128834165,
MarcoFalke,2015-08-07T21:11:09Z,"Can you provide evidence how this would benefit the network?\n\nAlso, there is a limited number of full nodes, thus a limited number of available inbound connections. What would happen, if there is a sudden demand (higher than the offered) number of inbound connections?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6533#issuecomment-128834901,128834901,

laanwj,2015-08-10T15:43:22Z,"NACK. I see no convincing evidence that this ""benefits the network"". At the very least you will have to precisely describe what you mean by ""stronger connections"".
