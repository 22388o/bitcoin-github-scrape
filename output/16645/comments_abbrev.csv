Christewart,2019-08-19 11:37:05,"Do we want to run these by default? This forces everyone to install rapidcheck. I think that is reasonable when we have a pre-configured way to easily install rapidcheck. AFAIK this isn't this case, unless I missed a PR.

jonatack,2019-08-19 11:47:28,"Currently, RapidCheck is auto-configured only if librapidcheck.a is detected, which IIUC doesn't force anyone to install it. I think this is outside the scope of the doc which addresses the current situation. FWIW I'm working on updating the RapidCheck Makefile to maybe/hopefully autobuild cleanly and can update this doc in that PR if needed.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16645#discussion_r315168361,315168361,doc/rapidcheck.md
