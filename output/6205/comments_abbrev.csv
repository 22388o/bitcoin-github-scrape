Diapolo,2015-06-06T08:50:36Z,@laanwj The problem I see is that `CRecipient` is defined in wallet.h and I couldn't get the walletless build to not error out yet -_- (there are quite some fancy dependencies).

laanwj,2015-06-06T09:20:19Z,"I guess so, but that'd be completely internal to that call - which is already very simple, and a pure utility method at that. So you'd have two unconnected parts of the source code somehow using the same data type. No, I don't really see that as useful code change. We already have CTxOut.

There's already at least one field in it that is irrelevant to payment requests. Also there is something to be said for keeping the payment server code somewhat more generic (e.g. future library).\n\nIf the goal is",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6205#issuecomment-110645603,110645603,
