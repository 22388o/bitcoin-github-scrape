dongcarl,2020-03-09 20:37:06,"Going to restate my understanding just to make sure I'm clear on the logic here:\n\nThe `AX_CHECK_LINK_FLAG` macro checks whether a linker flag exists by invoking the linker, and defines failures as when the linker ""gives an error"", however, warnings are ignored. Since it is possible that when the `AX_CHECK_LINK_FLAG` macro invokes the linker with a flag it doesn't understand, the linker only gi",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17874#issuecomment-596766632,596766632,

I didn't like how I'd split the addition of the flag up, so I've pushed a new version of this change where they are together.\n\nWhat this currently does is adding (either variant of) `-fatal_warnings` to the linker flags for all subsequent `AX_CHECK_LINK_FLAG` calls. `-fatal_warnings` does not get added to `LDFLAGS` and thu",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17874#issuecomment-597431127,597431127,

With `-Wl,--fatal-warnings`, if it is available, we only append it to the linker flags when checking whether other linker flags li",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17874#issuecomment-624530406,624530406,
