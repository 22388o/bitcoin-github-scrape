jtimon,2015-06-17T19:41:43Z,"yep, I want to avoid indenting the whole block to reduce the diff and potential for merge conflicts.\nAfter all, at some point we will start running clang-format project wise right before forking for major releases.

petertodd,2015-06-18T03:17:08Z,"I'd prefer those merge conflicts to stay merge conflicts, as it forces you to understand if that additional check matters for your merge.\n\nWhat can I say, I once fixed a bug where a lack of indentation of a newly added bit of code lead to a mistake that could have potentially played a part of getting someone killed, so... :/\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6299#discussion_r32696267,32696267,src/main.cpp

laanwj,2015-06-18T09:23:42Z,"Yes, that is still the plan at some point, although I'd say it's very low priority.\n\nReducing the diff is generally a good reason, but not enough to deviate this much from the coding style IMO. This makes the control flow harder to interpret in an important function.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6299#discussion_r32711931,32711931,src/main.cpp
