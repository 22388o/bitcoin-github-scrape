groffer,2011-08-03T06:53:50Z,Wouldn't it be better to just add documentation to the effect that scripts should always use the shortest sequence for pushing data?  Isn't that easier/safer than trying to change the validation rules?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/349#issuecomment-1715913,1715913,
gavinandresen,2011-08-09T15:37:26Z,Consensus seems to be that standardizing OP_PUSHDATA1 mush never push less than 76 bytes / etc is the right way to go.  I'm going to close this.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/349#issuecomment-1764363,1764363,
