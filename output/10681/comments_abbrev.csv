jonasschnelli,2017-06-28T19:55:14Z,"ACK.\n\nI personally use a different approach (I guess it's more complicated, though will not need to attach and works with IDE's)\n* replace a self.node object in the test with a custom added AuthProxy (to localhost and a fix port with a given rpcusername/pw)\n* Start (via IDE, gdb) a such localhost regtest peer (make sure it has an empty datadir)\n* run test",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10681#issuecomment-311769323,311769323,

jnewbery,2017-06-27T14:24:15Z,"I think this can be more easily achieved by `cat`ing the `.pid` file in the data directory. Find the data directory:\n\n```bash\n2017-06-27 14:13:56.686000 TestFramework (INFO): Initializing test directory /tmp/user/1000/testo9vsdjo3\n```\n\nThen `cat` the `.pid` file:\n\n```bash\ncat /tmp/user/1000/testo9vsdjo3/node0/regtest/bitcoind.pid\ngdb /home/example/bitcoind !$\n```\n\n(or if ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10681#discussion_r124288835,124288835,test/README.md

jnewbery,2017-06-27T15:13:04Z,"Yeah - if gdb can't attach to a specific PID, the error message is actually buried in the middle of the gdb text so it's not immediately obvious what the problem is. I think including the warning is helpful here.\n\nAlso, my above invocation was wrong:\n\n```bash\ncat /tmp/user/1000/testo9vsdjo3/node0/regtest/bitcoind.pid\ngdb /home/example/bitcoind !$\n```\n\nit should be:\n\n```\ncat",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10681#discussion_r124304397,124304397,test/README.md
