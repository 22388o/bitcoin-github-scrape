    "body": "Got it, thanks for clarifying -- I didn't realize that the concern was around the frequency that we pull things out of the new table to potentially move them to the tried table.\r\n\r\nI think the underlying question here is how often we want to be making outbound connections to the network (this is a question I was thinking about in the context of #19858 as well).  Both uses of FEELER connections today (moving things from new to tried, as well as the test-before-evict logic of resolving tried-table collisions) have the same property that their connections last a very short time.  So I think that we could ask ourselves, given a certain rate at which we're comfortable making new outbound connections, how many of those should go to the test-before-evict logic, and how many to the logic that is pulling entries from the new-table?  \r\n\r\nIn practice, it seems to me that tried-table collisions are relatively infrequent, probably less than a few times per day on nodes I've looked at, if I remember right.  So the effect of this on the new-table FEELER logic is low.  On the other hand, if it were to have a big effect somehow, then changing the logic so that we still make feeler connections to new-table peers at the once-every-2-minute rate will mean we're connecting to the network much more (assuming that we always make the test-before-evict connections when we need to).\r\n\r\nSo my inclination is that we don't need this change?  Or if we do want it, we should just put a rate limit in place so that we can reason about what bounds are achievable in the event of tried-table-collisions.\r\n\r\nBTW, the logic presented in this PR is incorrect, I think, because it only tries to resolve tried-table-collisions when we'd make a non-FEELER connection.  However, once we have all our outbound peers in place, we never try to make new non-FEELER connections (well, at least until #19858), so I think this basically breaks the test-before-evict logic as drafted now.",

In [Eclipse Attacks on Bitcoin\u2019s Peer-to-Peer Network](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity15/sec15-paper-heilman.pdf), the \"feeler\" and \"test-before-evict\" countermeasures do not seem to use overlapping terminology, so my suggestion is that our code be clearer about mapping to those countermeasure names as well.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion would be that we rename `ConnectionType::FEELER` to something like `ConnectionType::ADDRMAN_HELPER` or `ConnectionType::TEST_CONNECT` or something to indicate either that the connection is short-lived, or just for the addrman, or both.  And then document in our code that we use this brief-addrman-helper conn_type for both the feeler and test-before-evict peer selection logic.\r\n\r\nI think we could also rename the feeler timer to be the \"addrman-helper-timer\", and differentiate the two behaviors in code comments better, if that would make the logic clearer.\r\n\r\nI don't think it makes sense to add a second conn_type that has exactly the same properties as the first, just with a different name. Perhaps if we thought those behaviors might diverge in the future, it might make sense; but I don't anticipate that myself.\r\n",
