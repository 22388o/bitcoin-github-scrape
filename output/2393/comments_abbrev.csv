Diapolo,2013-03-22T07:30:07Z,"I tried them and they work, I just want to mention one more thing with the Window geometry. You are writing the setting when the destructor of BitcoinGUI is called. So when one want's to reset the Window position it is not possible to use the Options reset button, as the destructor call comes after and overwrites the cleaned settings with the modified Window position.\n\n2 options:\na) Don't use t",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2393#issuecomment-15284338,15284338,
laanwj,2013-03-22T15:45:36Z,"I agree with these changes.

laanwj,2013-03-23T06:49:42Z,"I agree that resetting the window position when pressing Reset is not really necessary, people can always move the window to where ever they want anyway.\n\nIt's also very hard to solve; moving saveGeometry call to another place than the destructor for example will not solve it, as long as it is still called every time the application quits.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2393#issuecomment-15332790,15332790,
