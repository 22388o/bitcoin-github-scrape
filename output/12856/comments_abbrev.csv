WillAyd,2018-04-02T15:22:53Z,"Hmm have there been intermittent travis failures? I looked into both here but can't see how they would be directly related to the change.

jnewbery,2018-04-02T16:20:30Z,"Concept ACK. I think the metaclass is useful to catch non-conforming tests. However, I think adding unit tests to test the test framework is probably overkill.\n\nI think I'd prefer this PR if the `BitcoinTestMetaClass` were just added directly to `test_framework.py`.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12856#issuecomment-377968376,377968376,
WillAyd,2018-04-02T16:23:49Z,Easy enough to revert. Do you want me to include the metaclass directly in `test_framework.py` instead of putting it in its own module?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12856#issuecomment-377969153,377969153,

WillAyd,2018-04-03T00:12:31Z,Looks like the failure here was on a make job on Travis but this change shouldn't not impact any compilation - any chance to restart that?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12856#issuecomment-378087285,378087285,

WillAyd,2018-04-02T06:04:04Z,As is this is not integrated into your current CI. Still trying to wrap my head around everything so I could be wrong on this but since you are using your own test suite / runner which uses this meta class I don't think there's a great way to integrate into your current workflow. This can be tested directly from the command line as needed,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12856#discussion_r178491923,178491923,test/functional/test_framework/test_base.py
WillAyd,2018-04-02T06:04:59Z,"To more strictly enforce this protocol I had to add this here, even though it just calls the superclass implementation anyway.

WillAyd,2018-04-06T17:02:58Z,That was intentional from our conversation in #12884. This would follow PEP8 so I figured bundle in here. OK to remove still if you want,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12856#discussion_r179818231,179818231,test/functional/test_framework/test_framework.py
