    "body": "It is important to specify `U` explicitly in cases where you're working with types of different rank, for example int and unsigned short. As the rank of the signed type is larger in that case the result will be a signed int, which might be not what you want.\n\nWhether it makes sense to do it here is a matter of taste / coding style. Usually it's indeed better to be explicit to prevent bugs due to undefined behavior popping up. And for bitwise arithmetic you should use unsigned types.\n\nBut this has its limits in practicality, it's not like it's necessary or more readable to add 'U' behind half the values in the program :)\n",
