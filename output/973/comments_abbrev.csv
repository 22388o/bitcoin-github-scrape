jgarzik,2012-03-22T04:03:56Z,"Looks like fun stuff to play around with... building now.\n\nDisagree with the minor AddAddress debug change.   Once a node is running, these messages are (a) minimal and (b) useful.  Better approach is to start separating messages at a much more fine grain, by introducing, e.g. fNetDebug (network-related messages) and fTxDebug (tx/mempool-related messages)\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/973#issuecomment-4632301,4632301,
