sipa,2016-04-18T09:31:36Z,Please see #7687 and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7551#issuecomment-209852807\n\nI would really prefer that importscript was a separate RPC implementation without all the magic effects of matching with addresses.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7903#issuecomment-211294658,211294658,
laanwj,2016-04-25T08:50:09Z,"I agree with @sipa. If you add a new method, make use of that opportunity to add a saner interface.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7903#issuecomment-214213297,214213297,
TheBlueMatt,2016-05-18T20:42:41Z,"I actually think the interface is (mostly) sane...indeed, adding a non-P2SH address is strangely handled, indeed. But the fact that imported addresses are treated as change (#7687) is a separate bug. You still need to be able to hand it a script and have it generate the P2SH address (optionally, sometimes you dont want this). importscript should probably be pretty much what it is here, IMO.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7903#issuecomment-220151826,220151826,
sipa,2016-08-25T12:01:26Z,I still believe that importscript should not copy all the magic behaviour of importaddress.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7903#issuecomment-242361598,242361598,
TheBlueMatt,2016-10-23T21:41:47Z,Closing in favor of other solutions.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7903#issuecomment-255616515,255616515,
