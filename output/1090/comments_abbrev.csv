Diapolo,2012-04-13T16:33:14Z,"So <br> can be used in strings for a word-wrap and \n will be replaced by it? Seems like a very good solution. Only question I have left is, if we can set a default width of tooltips.\n\nTry it with the current version, if you hover the lock-icon if your wallet is encrypted. This is rich text, but looks kind of ugly, because of the small width of the tooltip.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1090#issuecomment-5118406,5118406,
laanwj,2012-04-13T16:40:19Z,I'm not sure where it gets the default width from (which is indeed extremely narrow). Couldn't find any documentation about that. That leaves looking in the Qt source I guess...\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1090#issuecomment-5118573,5118573,
Diapolo,2012-04-13T16:42:59Z,"But you could verify that the default is to narrow, so this is no Win specific behaviour?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1090#issuecomment-5118638,5118638,
laanwj,2012-04-13T17:18:39Z,"No, it isn't specific to any OS. This seems to make the tooltips wider (crazily wide, in this case), for example:\n\n```\napp.setStyleSheet(""QToolTip { min-width: 500px; }"");\n```\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1090#issuecomment-5120018,5120018,

laanwj,2012-04-30T06:40:55Z,"No, I don't think it's a good idea to merge this between release candidates. That's only for critical bugfixes.
