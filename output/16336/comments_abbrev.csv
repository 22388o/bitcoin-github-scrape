fqlx,2019-07-04 03:44:02,Unnecessary to increment the counter here.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16336#discussion_r300219003,300219003,src/bloom.cpp
fqlx,2019-07-04 03:45:08,The code is follow camelCase and you are changing it to underscore_case.  Bad decision.  Follow the current style.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16336#discussion_r300219164,300219164,src/bloom.cpp
fqlx,2019-07-04 03:45:53,Prefix is unnecessary. Can you explain?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16336#discussion_r300219261,300219261,src/bloom.cpp
fqlx,2019-07-04 03:46:23,`4` should be in a enum so we understand the meaning,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16336#discussion_r300219312,300219312,src/bloom.cpp
fqlx,2019-07-04 03:46:37,Same with 1.  Needs to be a constant in some enum,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16336#discussion_r300219343,300219343,src/bloom.cpp
qmma70,2019-07-04 03:55:25,The `m_` convention denotes that the variable is a data member of the class. It is an aid for maintainers to avoid creating side effects by mistake. It doesn't contradict with the current style.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16336#discussion_r300220527,300220527,src/bloom.cpp
fqlx,2019-07-04 03:58:55,I understand!  Thanks!,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16336#discussion_r300221058,300221058,src/bloom.cpp
