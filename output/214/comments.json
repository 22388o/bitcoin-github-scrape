The current RPC code executes HTTP requests in order, in a FIFO queue.\n\nYou can find examples of this logic in \"My First TCP Server\" style code examples, but never in any production server.  A synchronous, FIFO approach stalls all clients except the \"current\" one.  If the current client is, itself, stalled or slow or misbehaving, then all other clients suffer.\n\nAsynchronous I/O + HTTP/1.1 keep alives are desperately needed to solve obvious problems seen in the field by heavy RPC users.\n",

    "body": "As I said, that issue is more easily solved by simply dispatching the RPC to a thread and making the trivial fixes to the keepalive logic. There aren't enough RPC connections, and the operation order is always accept/read/write, so you don't get any benefit from asynchronous I/O. In contrast, in the 'net' code, you have many connections and unpredictable operation order. That code would significantly benefit from async I/O.\n",

    "body": "I don't think many people, if any, expose their bitcoin RPC connections to the world. So I don't think the DoS issue is particularly important. I guess you could argue that they don't because they can't, and if they could, they might. But I think most people run a bitcoin client on each machine that needs to issue RPC queries and should bind their RPC listening sockets to 'localhost' only.\n\nAs for RPC not being scalable in modern workloads, I would argue that modern workloads include proper support for keepalives and don't require large numbers of connections.\n\nIf there's a realistic case where asio for RPC provides any benefit over thread-per-connection with proper keepalive support, I don't know what it is. Again, I still think this patch is \"the right thing to do\", but I don't think there will be any actual benefit in any realistic use case. (Again, over dipatching the RPC calls to threads and fixing the broken HTTP keepalive implementation. You have to at least do that.)\n",
