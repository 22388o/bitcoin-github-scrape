gkrizek,2018-12-26T21:53:49Z,"As previously commented, when you add a name to your jobs the Travis UI removes the environment variables from the build when in the list view. (They still show up when you view an individual build's page). I think having a build name is more valuable in the list view than the variables. We can always add some sort of 'tag' to the job name if we feel that's needed.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15020#issuecomment-450031721,450031721,

scravy,2018-12-21T19:07:21Z,I for one value very much to be able to see the build environment variables when looking at the travis overview page for the build. This is lost now as one sees only this identifier. I like to see the environment variables to understand whether the particular build runs functional tests and/or unit tests or not. Maybe this information should be added to the name.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15020#discussion_r243667126,243667126,.travis.yml
gkrizek,2018-12-21T19:18:34Z,I left them because some contain information that I didn't want to put in the job name. Like the Xenial build for example.
