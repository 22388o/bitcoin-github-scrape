sipa,2015-02-11T22:25:22Z,"@sdaftuar Thanks for the tests, and nice catch, though it shouldn't matter. When combined with the standardness requirements, STRICTENC and DERSIG should be identical (they can differ when the result of a CHECKSIG is negated, but there are no standard scripts that do so).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5765#issuecomment-73978204,73978204,
rebroad,2015-07-07T10:37:02Z,"Ok so given how this fork has gone horribly wrong - i.e. people advertised they would support BIP66, so the software switched over to the new rules only to discover that mining continues with the old rules - I propose that future hardforks include a FALL-BACK in the event that it is determined that not 95% is actually implementing the new rules. Is this possible to do for future hard-forks?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5765#issuecomment-119164432,119164432,

rebroad,2016-03-17T10:59:40Z,"@sipa it would be possible I am sure, by analysing the InvalidBlocks that are coming though and checking if they would be valid in the case of a fall-back - if there are a sufficient number of these invalid blocks, then it would trigger the fall-back.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5765#issuecomment-197819724,197819724,
