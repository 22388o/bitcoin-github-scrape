laanwj,2016-08-04T10:10:46Z,"From a design point I really liked CTransaction as immutable transaction data, but yes it's better to be without the C++ hacks.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8451#issuecomment-237511581,237511581,
dcousens,2016-08-04T19:42:08Z,Wouldn't this also negate the need for `CMutableTransaction`? (which is only used in `bitcoin-tx`?)\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8451#issuecomment-237661453,237661453,
sipa,2016-08-04T19:45:00Z,"@dcousens It's used in all signing code. And CMutableTransaction has the advantage of not needing to call UpdateHash all the time, so it may be useful to keep.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8451#issuecomment-237662188,237662188,
sipa,2016-08-04T20:24:54Z,"@laanwj I agree, it gave a pretty clean and safe abstraction... but I know no way to do it correctly with the current serialization framework. We should think about a construct-while-deserializing mechanism if we want that.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8451#issuecomment-237672432,237672432,

sipa,2016-08-08T20:15:02Z,"@daira In my understanding (but I may be wrong), a reference to a const value only means that that value cannot be modified _through_ that reference but does not mean that it cannot change overall. This is different from declaring a variable or field as const, which means it cannot change at all.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8451#issuecomment-238362364,238362364,
sipa,2016-08-16T10:05:31Z,"@daira I addressed all your comments apart from the returning of const uint256&.\n\nThis issue made me investigate the concept of const correctness in C++ much more deeply, but all explanations I can find state that a const reference merely means that the value aliased by that reference cannot be modifed _through that const reference_. It is not a guarantee that the value cannot be modified at all",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8451#issuecomment-240060478,240060478,
