jonasschnelli,2016-01-19T14:19:53Z,Nice!\nTested ACK (on a different repo: https://github.com/digitalbitbox/dbb-app/commit/a592638e733a124426145cb0601907561ecd9975).\n\nThought for future additions:\n- show the head SHA256 hash from the PR (possible short compare against the one you have ACKed)\n- short command to diff the PR (temp bash alias instead of typing `git diff HEAD~1`?)\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7378#issuecomment-172867435,172867435,

laanwj,2016-01-20T11:28:37Z,"> show the head SHA256 hash from the PR (possible short compare against the one you have ACKed)\n\nThe simplest idea there would be to print the commit message for the merge to the console. It has all context information: the pull #,  the pull title, and the SHA (not 256) hashes for the commits in topological order.\n(this can be done in a later pull, not going to do so now)\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7378#issuecomment-173177394,173177394,

MarcoFalke,2016-01-19T16:00:24Z,"Could make sense to ""sanitize"" the title such that it fits in the git(hub) subject line.\n\nThat is, `return title[0:min(80, len(title)) - len(""Merge pull request #xxxx: ""]`\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7378#discussion_r50130758,50130758,contrib/devtools/github-merge.py
laanwj,2016-01-20T09:51:30Z,I don't know - I don't like it cut off.\nAt least github tends to handle long title lines already by adding ... and continuing on the next line.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7378#discussion_r50233580,50233580,contrib/devtools/github-merge.py

laanwj,2016-01-20T12:30:39Z,"BTW: is anyone opposed to combining 'accept' and 'sign off' into one step? I may be overlooking something, but I've never completely understood why these are separate, why you would accept a change but then not sign it (which is mandatory).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7378#discussion_r50248240,50248240,contrib/devtools/github-merge.py
