I agree it's a bad idea to include such a wallet-compatibility change at the end of the 0.6 development, but does wallet.dat variation really matter (i.e. is there a standard defined, when this is allowed and when not)?\n\nIs there a safe way to, let's say, force all wallets to use the",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/950#issuecomment-4575693,4575693,

I don't see why there is any objection to making another wallet version that is non-backward-compatible: wallets in 0.6 are already not compatible with any previous versions, so this is just another change that makes them further incompatible.
