    "body": "@gmaxwell I agree, but, I think the only place that this could happen with this PR is if a node serves a block and then immediately sends either a getblocks or a getheaders. I'm not aware any nodes are currently doing this, and if they are, I could modify this PR to delay responding to the getheaders or getblocks until the chain has been updated quite easily. If this functionality is so important, perhaps a test ought to be added to test for this?",
