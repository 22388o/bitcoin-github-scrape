fanquake,2021-06-30 03:05:51,"Concept ACK. I think the fix is correct, however this needs a better explanation than just linking to a Boost issue or stack overflow post (which just links back to the same Boost issue). Neither actually explain the problem or solution, other than, copy-pasting these lines [""made the compilation error(s) go away""](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59337197/boostprocess-on-windows-with-mingw/593",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22348#issuecomment-871061160,871061160,
