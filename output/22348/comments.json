    "body": "Concept ACK. I think the fix is correct, however this needs a better explanation than just linking to a Boost issue or stack overflow post (which just links back to the same Boost issue). Neither actually explain the problem or solution, other than, copy-pasting these lines [\"made the compilation error(s) go away\"](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59337197/boostprocess-on-windows-with-mingw/59338759#59338759). There's also no indication of when the fix is needed from, or can be dropped.\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that between Boost 1.64.0 and 1.70.0, there are no issues using Boost Process and mingw-w64. Although I haven't tested this.\r\n\r\n[This commit](https://github.com/boostorg/process/commit/7fc41b2815822b632d524d5c17897abbdf0c4653), containing the `__kernel_entry` [SAL annotations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/code-quality/using-sal-annotations-to-reduce-c-cpp-code-defects?view=msvc-160)  was included in Boost Process as part of the `1.71.0` release, which broke support for compiling with mingw-w64 because it doesn't define the `__kernel_entry` SAL annotation (but it does define some others, i.e see [`sal.h`](https://github.com/mirror/mingw-w64/blob/master/mingw-w64-headers/include/sal.h)).\r\n\r\nA [commit was made](https://github.com/boostorg/process/pull/171/commits/d7a721ee0d6859847947f60911259e2c34b0d066) to remove the annotations, however, it hasn't made it into either of the two Boost releases that have happened since (1.75.0 & 1.76.0). Meaning that this is currently needed for all versions of Boost process from 1.71.0 onwards.",
