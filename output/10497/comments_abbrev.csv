benma,2017-06-01T13:55:56Z,"@fanquake thanks for pointing it out, I wasn't aware of the other PR.

jtimon,2017-06-01T17:30:42Z,"Rebasing #10193 isn't hard at all, once I wrote the sed scripts once it's just running them again. The problem with #10193 is that the reverse iterator to replace BOOST_REVERSE_FOREACH isn't working for some reason. So I separated #10502 with the first 3 commits that could be merged right away.\nI would really prefer to do this using scripted-diff to make sure the removal is complete, on the othe",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10497#issuecomment-305564105,305564105,
