laanwj,2013-12-17T06:33:54Z,"I am very much in favor of putting each file on a separate line in makefiles, as this makes diffs easier to review.\n\nHowever, this should probably go in after the other real makefile changes (such as Qt5 support) to prevent breaking them.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3432#issuecomment-30729226,30729226,
Diapolo,2013-12-17T06:53:44Z,"@theuni Thanks for catching that one... perhaps you can add the `set -e` in yout Qt5 pull?\n\n@laanwj This took me some minutes to check every file for existense and re-ordering the entries alphabetically, too.

laanwj,2013-12-17T08:45:32Z,@Diapolo in that case it may be better to drop the Makefile.am changes in this pull and let us take care of them along with other changes.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3432#issuecomment-30734418,30734418,
Diapolo,2013-12-17T13:45:28Z,"@laanwj I'm not sure if I get it, perhaps it's easy for @theuni to just rebase his Qt5 pull on this, so why not just merge what is there. He intended to update his pull tomorrow anyway :).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3432#issuecomment-30751398,30751398,
