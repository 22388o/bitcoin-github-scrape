dooglus,2017-03-26T11:42:00Z,"@sipa If linearize.py creates bootstrap.dat format files from a synced blockchain then I guess so. I hadn't heard of linearize.py.\n\nAre you talking about `contrib/linearize/linearize-data.py`? That's the closest I can find in this repository.\n\nI find it convenient to use `dumpbootstrap` to dump the portion of the blockchain I want into a linear file but understand if you don't want the fun",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10081#issuecomment-289276285,289276285,
laanwj,2017-03-27T07:58:25Z,"I think this could be useful in some cases.\n\nHowever remembering the recent discussion on `dumpwallet` (#9937, #9934), I'd prefer not to have more RPCs that create or write server-side files. It introduces security risks, can load to dangerous situations (e.g. overwriting the wallet) and also interferes with future process sandboxing.\n\nThe ideal solution to this would be to stream the data",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10081#issuecomment-289380691,289380691,
laanwj,2017-06-14T13:36:13Z,"Let's close this for now. Tooling to generate `bootstrap.dat` is available, after all, and it doesn't seem like something that has a lot of users, so I'm not convinced it makes sense to merge this.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10081#issuecomment-308433031,308433031,
