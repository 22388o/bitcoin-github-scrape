    "body": "I think this could be useful in some cases.\r\n\r\nHowever remembering the recent discussion on `dumpwallet` (#9937, #9934), I'd prefer not to have more RPCs that create or write server-side files. It introduces security risks, can load to dangerous situations (e.g. overwriting the wallet) and also interferes with future process sandboxing.\r\n\r\nThe ideal solution to this would be to stream the data over HTTP instead, which I attempted to introduce in #7759. Unfortunately I had no time to continue that.\r\n\r\nAnd as said, this is already what the `linarize` tooling does. There is not an urgent need to have this functionality in bitcoind.",
