sdaftuar,2016-11-19T21:47:23Z,"I'm not sure why we wouldn't ask this peer for compact blocks just because they are not relaying transactions.  Our mempool might be perfectly good for block reconstruction, even if the peer who is relaying blocks to us fastest is blocksonly, no? \n\nI know that in the future we're likely to want to optimize the prefilled transactions based eg on what was missing from our own mempools, but I think",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8800#discussion_r88788632,88788632,src/main.cpp
gmaxwell,2016-12-01T19:37:04Z,"The thinking there was that if the peer is trying to economize bandwidth, we shouldn't ask them to send the unsolicited compact blocks (HB mode). We'll still request compact blocks from them when advertised.  I don't fee super strongly, if they're trying to economize on bandwidth they should probably delay their relays artificially.  We don't have a NAK for HB mode requests though.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8800#discussion_r90520605,90520605,src/main.cpp
