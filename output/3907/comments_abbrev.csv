laanwj,2014-03-29T11:24:05Z,"Nothing missing IMO, but I am waiting for someone else from the core devs to comment on the weight issue (I think michagogo 1 versus the rest 40 makes no sense).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3907#issuecomment-38992914,38992914,
sipa,2014-03-29T16:20:29Z,This isn't actually used in any way right now. Maybe we want to postpone the weights discussion until an actual downloader is ready and being deployed?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3907#issuecomment-39000339,39000339,

Michagogo,2014-03-30T13:47:52Z,"Okay, at this point I have a question. What is the point of contrib/gitian-downloader existing with the configs at all if we're not using them?
