jgarzik,2013-07-22T14:44:46Z,1) Feature request seems sane.  30 second glance did not turn up any bugaboos.\n\n2) Mild conflict with #2776 but easily resolved.\n\n3) Waiting to see if pulltesters likes these new commits.  A bit worried that the first commit breaks git bisect?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2841#issuecomment-21348723,21348723,

sipa,2013-10-22T08:20:41Z,Maybe I/someone should just implement very basic BIP32 key generation instead :)\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2841#issuecomment-26784884,26784884,
laanwj,2013-10-22T09:50:41Z,That'd be a good option too. But as long as we have a keypool option (and I don't think it's wise to completely do away with the keypool as soon as introducing deterministic wallet support) having more explicit control over it would be useful. And this code is already written...\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2841#issuecomment-26789927,26789927,
