fanquake,2016-12-27T00:13:41Z,Looks ok. utACK 1f30bc3,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9433#issuecomment-269250856,269250856,
droark,2016-12-27T17:35:47Z,Removed the -j flags (my own and the ones that were present) and did a fixup/reword. @jonasschnelli and @sipa brought up good points regarding parallelism. Doing a parallel make on the depends portion caused several errors on my system. I was able to keep trying and get it to work but it wasn't ideal.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9433#issuecomment-269357177,269357177,

jonasschnelli,2016-12-27T08:21:26Z,nit: not sure if we should set the `jobs` amount in the documentation. IMO we also don't do that for other build docs. It depends on available RAM/cores.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9433#discussion_r93906756,93906756,doc/build-windows.md
sipa,2016-12-27T16:46:27Z,"If you're going to add `-j` in places, at least explain that it impacts parallellism in a comment.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9433#discussion_r93949035,93949035,doc/build-windows.md
