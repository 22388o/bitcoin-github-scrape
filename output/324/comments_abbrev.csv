gavinandresen,2011-06-24T15:22:07Z,What is this for?  I'm about to start working on the 'headers only' branch that will break this (because not every node will store every transaction).\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/324#issuecomment-1433019,1433019,
forrestv,2011-06-29T15:10:27Z,"This is for providing a way for RPC clients to check the status of transactions.
