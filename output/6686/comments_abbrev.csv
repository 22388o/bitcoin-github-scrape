jonasschnelli,2015-09-19T09:15:17Z,"Somehow even if travis successfully installs `libzmq3` and `python-zmq`, the rpc test can't connect over zmq with bitcoind.\nStill try to figure out why...\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6686#issuecomment-141639775,141639775,
theuni,2015-09-22T02:27:43Z,Does this work locally? It's not clear to me what needs to be native and what needs to be per-arch.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6686#issuecomment-142161126,142161126,
jonasschnelli,2015-09-22T07:56:32Z,@theuni \nThe zmq_test.py (RPC test) works prefect locally. Tested on OSX/Debian and Ubuntu.\nThe `zmq_test.py` changes within this PR are for debugging purposes. \nI can only encounter the problem in Travis builds.\nIt looks like that zmq tcp:// connection does not work in travis. Even after installing python-zmq. Also my solution (`sudo rm -f /etc/apt/sources.list.d/travis_ci_zeromq3-source.list,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6686#issuecomment-142206416,142206416,
jonasschnelli,2015-09-29T09:13:17Z,@theuni: Any idea how we could fix this? Having CI tests for the ZMQ would be important IMO otherwise the risks are high that things break without noticing.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6686#issuecomment-144001303,144001303,
theuni,2015-09-29T17:39:56Z,@jonasschnelli I need to spend a bit of time learning about the intricacies of zmq/python here. But I'll try to track down the issue.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6686#issuecomment-144131638,144131638,
theuni,2015-09-29T23:48:43Z,@jonasschnelli This fixes: https://github.com/theuni/bitcoin/commit/05a7243678e97b3944c5ceb23c4b05c57fb9c42f . Problem was the old libzmq that the pyzmq was using. Installing the newer pyzmq from a ppa pulls in newer versions of both.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6686#issuecomment-144222672,144222672,
jonasschnelli,2015-10-01T13:39:45Z,Added @theuni commit.\nTravis is happy now.\nThis would add CI coverage of the ZMQ feature.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6686#issuecomment-144728406,144728406,
