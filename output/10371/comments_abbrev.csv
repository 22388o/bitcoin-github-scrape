MarcoFalke,2017-05-09T16:36:55Z,Please no trailing whitespace. This will cause issues in version control when used with editors that remove trailing whitespace by default.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10371#discussion_r115538075,115538075,src/test/addrman_tests.cpp

jnewbery,2017-05-09T19:04:07Z,"I was going to suggest you update this if statement to follow our style guidelines (continuation on the same line if the block is one line, or braces), but really I don't think an if statement has any business being here at all. This is a test case - we should be asserting all our expectations (and indeed we do in the line above).\n\nSuggest you remove the if line and run `BOOST_CHECK(info1->ToS",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10371#discussion_r115574731,115574731,src/test/addrman_tests.cpp
jimmysong,2017-05-09T19:19:26Z,Thanks for the review! Changed.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10371#discussion_r115578865,115578865,src/test/addrman_tests.cpp
MarcoFalke,2017-05-09T19:23:05Z,This was added as a guard against null pointer dereference,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10371#discussion_r115579595,115579595,src/test/addrman_tests.cpp
jimmysong,2017-05-09T19:37:03Z,"That makes sense. Still trying to figure this out. @jnewbery, what's the coding standard that I should change the if to?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10371#discussion_r115582575,115582575,src/test/addrman_tests.cpp
jnewbery,2017-05-09T19:48:19Z,"Doesn't `BOOST_CHECK(info1)` check that info1 is non-null?\n\nAnd if not, surely it's better to fail the test than silently continue?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10371#discussion_r115584926,115584926,src/test/addrman_tests.cpp
MarcoFalke,2017-05-09T20:01:19Z,According to http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_64_0/libs/test/doc/html/boost_test/utf_reference/testing_tool_ref/assertion_boost_level.html you could use `BOOST_REQUIRE()`,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10371#discussion_r115588034,115588034,src/test/addrman_tests.cpp
jimmysong,2017-05-09T21:01:09Z,attempt 3. Please let me know if this is satisfies everything @jnewbery @MarcoFalke ,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10371#discussion_r115601467,115601467,src/test/addrman_tests.cpp
