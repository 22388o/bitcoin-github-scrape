laanwj,2015-01-11T09:04:38Z,See also #4121 for prior discussion.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5636#issuecomment-69487940,69487940,
Diapolo,2015-01-11T18:14:28Z,"@laanwj Well, just using e.g. `-rootcertificates=""D:\paymentrequest-master\ca_in_a_box\certs\cacert.pem""` doesn't allow using self signed certs at all, so IMHO this is a good thing to add. I'm going to change the hard-coded 18 into the correct OpenSSL error code.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5636#issuecomment-69504334,69504334,
jonasschnelli,2015-01-12T09:48:37Z,"Shouldn't we bring up a dialog, present a minimalistic cert representation and ask the user if he likes to accept the self signed cert? But maybe this is overfed.\n\nconceptual ACK.\nNeeds unit test for definitive ACK.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5636#issuecomment-69547170,69547170,
laanwj,2015-01-12T11:58:56Z,"No, don't add any UI for accepting self-signed (or otherwise invalid) certificate. Too easy to trick people.\n\nI'm fine with this pull, but keep this a hidden developer-only feature.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5636#issuecomment-69560157,69560157,
Diapolo,2015-01-12T12:21:16Z,"Agree and indeed, it IS intended as dev-only feature :).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5636#issuecomment-69562308,69562308,
jonasschnelli,2015-01-12T12:27:07Z,Okay. Sounds better to keep it small and sane.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5636#issuecomment-69562908,69562908,
Diapolo,2015-01-12T13:43:39Z,@laanwj So this was an ACK?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5636#issuecomment-69571067,69571067,
Diapolo,2015-01-15T08:11:18Z,@gavinandresen Mind also giving an ACK here?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5636#issuecomment-70052380,70052380,
jonasschnelli,2015-01-11T19:20:55Z,Hmm... isn't this BoolArg a bit long?\nI still struggle with `rpcsslcertificatechainfile`...\nIMO: at least certificate could be shorten with cert.\n\nThis arg will not get listed anywhere in `--help` or exposed in GUI settings?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5636#discussion_r22769136,22769136,src/qt/paymentrequestplus.cpp
jonasschnelli,2015-01-11T19:26:11Z,More clear:\ndoing `./bitcoin-qt --help -help-debug` won't show the arg in your shell? Only in QT?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5636#discussion_r22769181,22769181,src/qt/paymentrequestplus.cpp
Diapolo,2015-01-12T06:55:02Z,"The argument should be listed for bitcoin-qt and just there (did you test it is not?). Windows executable doesn't use shell just the window with the options.\n\nI used the word `certificates` in the new option, because the related option reads `-rootcertificates` and `alowselfsigned` is a prefix for it ;)?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5636#discussion_r22776798,22776798,src/qt/paymentrequestplus.cpp
