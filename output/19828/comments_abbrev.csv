theStack,2020-08-28 15:59:58,"> Why not `balances[addr] += n` ?\n\nHeh, I also thought about that, but then had doubts that integral types (without ctor) also get initialized. Seems I was wrong: ""When invoking operator[] and the key is missing, the value is initialized using the expression mapped_type() which is the default constructor for class types, and zero initialization for integral types."" https://stackoverflow.com/a/",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19828#discussion_r479395450,479395450,src/wallet/wallet.cpp
