MarcoFalke,2017-08-25T16:39:32Z,The dependencies for the functional tests are mentioned in https://github.com/danra/bitcoin/tree/master/test#dependencies,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11136#issuecomment-324973398,324973398,
danra,2017-08-25T16:43:13Z,"@MarcoFalke OK, but I don't think it makes sense for build_osx.md to recommend running `make check` on one hand, while on the other hand not mentioning the dependencies for running it when listing the dependencies earlier.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11136#issuecomment-324974337,324974337,
MarcoFalke,2017-08-25T16:43:45Z,"The readme in src/test mentions that the unit tests can be run with `make check`, but doesn't mention the python3 dependency. We might combine [the src/test readme](https://github.com/danra/bitcoin/blob/3f726c99f819f97f2ab21b94d34c6b3129cd883a/src/test/README.md#compilingrunning-unit-tests) into [the /test/ readme](https://github.com/danra/bitcoin/blob/3f726c99f819f97f2ab21b94d34c6b3129cd883a/test",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11136#issuecomment-324974477,324974477,
laanwj,2017-08-28T07:52:33Z,"Concept ACK, as python 3 is required for the unit tests (not just the functional tests in `test/functional`) we should just mention it as dependency.\n(it used to be the case that `make check` could be done without python 3)",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11136#issuecomment-325285495,325285495,
MarcoFalke,2017-08-28T20:20:14Z,"Fine with me, but please also update the dependencies for ubuntu/fedora",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11136#issuecomment-325468954,325468954,
danra,2017-08-28T20:28:19Z,@MarcoFalke I've only checked the dependencies on my macOS. Should I just add `python3` to the build documentation for the platforms you mentioned as well?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11136#issuecomment-325471358,325471358,
MarcoFalke,2017-08-28T20:56:21Z,"Yes, python3 will be required on the other platforms as well.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11136#issuecomment-325478876,325478876,
