gmaxwell,2017-07-16T22:54:49Z,"promag's solution is a bit more robust against code being moved around, otoh, if the end becomes reachable and there is no return statement the compiler will warn...  though are we sure we won't get false positives for that warning on some compilers?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10845#discussion_r127619163,127619163,src/wallet/db.cpp
promag,2017-07-16T23:02:32Z,Yes the compiler should warn. For me this is too long for not to have a clear return value. But consider it a nit.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10845#discussion_r127619328,127619328,src/wallet/db.cpp
promag,2017-07-16T23:04:20Z,Maybe leave to a future PR to remove the `while (true)`.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10845#discussion_r127619369,127619369,src/wallet/db.cpp
