After all, we can't reliably control how long it is shown.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1914#issuecomment-9423773,9423773,
Diapolo,2012-10-14T19:19:46Z,"Well it is shown as long as it takes to shutdown the client, which is a behaviour I like. When there is some DB work to do before we can shutdown, you clearly see the client is still working in the background. A quick shutdown means you just see this flash up and disappear.\n\nDid you try / test the patch?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1914#issuecomment-9424652,9424652,

laanwj,2012-10-31T06:21:32Z,"The problem is that notification behavior is OS dependent.
