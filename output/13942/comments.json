E.g. `#include <uint256.h>` in `validation_block_utils.h`\r\n> Every .cpp and .h file should #include every header file it directly uses classes, functions or other definitions from, even if those headers are already included indirectly through other headers.`\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/developer-notes.md\r\n\r\nI'm concerned about the fact that the globals are still set in `validation.cpp`. Seems moving those to `validation_globals.cpp` would be more consistent with that file's purpose of containing and presenting the globals. One idea is to rename `validation_block_utils.h` to `chainstate.h` and move `g_chainstate`, `mapBlockIndex` and `chainActive` out to it.",

Similarly, `g_chainstate` cannot yet be moved to file included by `validation`, because `CChainState` uses `ConnectTrace` that uses `MemPoolRemovalReason` from `txmempool`, which includes `validation` (circular dep again). As fixing those other CDs is beyond this pull request scope, I suggest to do it in another PR after those other lint issues are fixed.\r\n\r\nDirect includes were added for both symbols used in `validation_...` files and symbols that are defined in `validation_...`. Where it was possible redundant includes for `validation` were removed, leading to removal of another circular dep: `checkpoints->validation->checkpoints` (!)",

    "body": "@jimpo Thanks for pointing it out. I'll close it after #13144 being merged and continue to work on splitting `validation` in next PR. Still, there is a circular dependency in #14035 but I guess it may be solved within scope of that PR (interface between index and validation or something, but after #13144 merge). No rebase for now unless explicitly requested.\r\n\r\nedit: Please note that also `checkpoints -> validation -> checkpoints` dependency was removed here due to `validation` split",
