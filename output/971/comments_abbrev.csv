TheBlueMatt,2012-03-23T22:42:40Z,"It seems to me this adds more function calls to more complicated functions to give os-specific path separators when, though an os may prefer one or another, it accepts both.

Diapolo,2012-03-23T22:58:22Z,"On Linux or POSIX OSes make_preferred() does nothing, so no harm here.
