jnewbery,2017-08-17T15:16:19Z,"> Is it just me or has the number of spurious Travis failures increased recently?\n\n@practicalswift - yes, that's my sense as well. This particular failure is a new test added by me in #11001, but I haven't seen it fail in this way before. It appears that the node doesn't receive a version message that the test framework sends to it, possibly because we're trying to connect too soon after chang",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11076#issuecomment-323103765,323103765,
