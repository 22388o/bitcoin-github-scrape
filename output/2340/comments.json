It may make zero-conf tx's take a little longer to show up for SatoshiDice, but other than that possible issue I didn't have any problems. (the android wallet seems to have been updated to never show unconfirmed tx's so that's a non-issue) I couldn't test inputs.io properly because right now they aren't showing _any_ transactions as confirmed for my account, nLockTime or not.\n\nNote that this version is still the weaker one compatible with the current off-by-one behavior of the rest of the network that https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2342 fixes.\n\nWhat does BitPay do with nLockTime-using transactions?\n",

Instead the wallet shows a big read \"this transaction is non-standard and should not be trusted\" until it confirmed - kinda silly.\n\nfdb100df609349802c90dee38c694f3626b6c1f62a20ba92603ad17202b09322 - nLockTime=1, and nSequence set so nLockTime is active, but the tx is locked. It eventually showed up in my wallet, but only after a confirmation. It didn't show up immediately.\n\na4cceb4df7db3507966e57aea6d8f7b21ceabee55bac573e9b9590229fde6a3f - This one, and a few like it, are the worst though: they are time-locked transactions, and every one of them not only didn't know up prior to being confirmed, but even after being confirmed they still didn't show up in my wallet. tx 6ed945173e1455edf09931b4c7caac165c7d834ddc1ea296a24b9213a45cf24d is a particularly extreme example, having the minimum possible \"lock-by-time\" nLockTime.\n\nCuriously if nLockTime > the \"lock-by-time\" range, but all the sequence numbers are set so the tx is locked, the transaction also never shows up and doesn't display that \"this transaction is non-standard\" error message. For example: 8100cb9c84cf2f9c78ab2e6b488feb0a531e2ef88a1d1d28243a9e8361a433a7\n\nFinally after re-scanning the chain all the tx's showed up in my wallet.\n",

    "body": "@gmaxwell Most of those practices are things other wallets can and should adopt, e.g. S-values and using new addresses for change. Fees will be increasingly floating in the future, which makes them less useful as a distinguisher.\n\n@luke-jr Not necessarily. For instance a CoinJoin transaction may be completed in a time long enough for multiple blocks to be created, in which case the transaction sticks out compared to transactions created otherwise. Similarly users using high-latency anonymization networks can only guess at what nLockTime to use.\n\nNow maybe those issues can be satisfactorily solved by randomizing the nLockTime chosen, say 90% of the time pick the default, 10% of the time pick something at random from the last 100 blocks.\n\nNote that there is also a propagation issue, although that's similar to how we don't repropagate orphan tx's after we learn about their parents - the fix can make use of that machinery. The code has to be neutered right now by setting nLockTime back 1 from what it could be to deal with the nLockTime off-by-one bug - maybe it'd be best to change that to 10 back to be safer so that the initial rollout only triggers nLockTime-related bugs rather than propagation problems.\n\nIn any case this is a cost-benefit problem. The problem of fee-sniping is only apparent with large mining pools comprising a significant fraction of the total mining power and fees significantly larger than the block reward. While we have the former, the latter is a long way off. At the same time we already know mining pools already have an incentive to become bigger due to orphan costs; the incentive to become larger to fee snipe is probably small in comparison.\n",

It chanages paths in makefile.linux-mingw or otherwise changes build scripts in a way that made them incompatible with the automated testing scripts (please tweak those patches in qa/pull-tester)\n2. It adds/modifies tests which test network rules (thanks for doing that), which conflicts with a patch applied at test time\n3. It does not build on either Linux i386 or Win32 (via MinGW cross compile)\n4. The test suite fails on either Linux i386 or Win32\n5. The block test-cases failed (lookup the first bNN identifier which failed in https://github.com/TheBlueMatt/test-scripts/blob/master/FullBlockTestGenerator.java)\n\nIf you believe this to be in error, please ping BlueMatt on freenode or TheBlueMatt here.\n\nThis test script verifies pulls every time they are updated. It, however, dies sometimes and fails to test properly.  If you are waiting on a test, please check timestamps to verify that the test.log is moving at http://jenkins.bluematt.me/pull-tester/current/\nContact BlueMatt on freenode if something looks broken.\n",

If I'm right about that, then the 110 issue can be fixed by dropping the number down from 100 to 89(?). (or you could just add a check for an underflow, or for a low chainActive.Height...)\n",
