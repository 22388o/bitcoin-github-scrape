    "body": "Interesting. I definitely want shared locks at some point in the future.\n\nYou seem to implement some own implementation for a recursive shared lock? That certainly needs a lot of testing, as it can easily have subtle bugs. Maybe it is easier to clean up the code so that we don't need recursive locking at all (if all data structures are properly encapsulated, you can put the taking of locks in all entry functions, and never further inside).\n\nAlso, to get the best performance, you'll also need support for upgradable locks. For example, connecting a block has two stages, one where data is read from the backend (inputs fetched from db), and one where the changes are committed. If the first stage happens in an upgradable lock, it can happen concurrently with read-only locks (most RPC queries...), even while protecting that only a single (potential) writer is active.\n",

    "body": "Sadly, boost only provides recursive locking support in boost::recursive_mutex, not in boost::shared_mutex.  Thus I had to add recursive checking to CCriticalSection.  In terms of making bitcoin not need recursive locks...that would get very ugly.  Bitcoin is such a mess as it is, trying to track down all the cases where we depend on recursive locks, I would think, would be quite a bit of effort.  Yes something like this needs to be beaten on for a while before merge, but the code is pretty straightforward.  Also, Im still adding more test cases.\n\nAdded upgrade lock.\n",

The only case where you'd use it, is something that needs to be solved in another way: you'd need to have taken an upgradable lock in the first place. If data was read while in the shared lock, and used to make an update while having the exclusive lock, the results will be wrong if an update happens in between.\n\nIdeally, every public method of a well-encapsulated data structure will either take a shared or upgradable lock, and the inner code can take exclusive locks when necessary. Not taking an upgradable lock if you intend to make modification in the same lock-session is simply an error.\n\nPut otherwise: providing the ability to switch from shared lock to exclusive lock will only lead to hard-to-detect programming errors. Yes, there may be cases where you want two separate lock-sessions (the first one shared, and the second one exclusive), but doing it implicitly makes it only more confusing.\n",

This is especially a problem with cs_main, which covers multiple, largely unrelated data structures.  Yes, if Bitcoin were designed properly and if the switch to using shared/upgrade/unique locks were instant, it likely wouldn't be an issue.  However, take, ProcessMessage, it currently takes a cs_main exclusive lock, however it is conceivable that many of its branches only need a SHARED or UPGRADE lock.  Take, specifically, tx processing.  It is conceivable that tx processing will only need a mempool exclusive lock, and only a shared lock on cs_main.  However, once the tx is accepted and the wallet is called to process, the wallet may end up taking a cs_main lock as a part of one of its routines (even though it may only need a shared lock, but the old code only knows exclusive).  Debugging such issues and tracking down each case where this may occur can get very complicated in the current bitcoin codebase.  The idea behind providing shared->exclusive upgrade is to take away one more thing that would otherwise have to be audited for when converting to shared locking.  Yes, such things /should/ be caught, but there is no guarantee and it takes away just one more failure mode.\n",
