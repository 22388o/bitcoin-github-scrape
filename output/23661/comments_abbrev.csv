jonatack,2021-12-06T12:25:36Z,This assertion in the definition seems unneeded? IIUC the lock annotation in the function declaration enforces it.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23661#discussion_r762960734,762960734,src/validation.cpp
jonatack,2021-12-06T12:28:08Z,Why use the `::cs_main` global reference here rather than `cs_main`? ,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23661#discussion_r762962528,762962528,src/validation.h
MarcoFalke,2021-12-06T12:35:10Z,"I think for new code we prefer `::global`, unless the name of the global is prefixed with `g_...`, in which case `::g_...` and `g_...` are allowed.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23661#discussion_r762967457,762967457,src/validation.h
