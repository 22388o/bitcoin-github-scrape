Even bringing up the topic of alt-coins otherwise is loudly discouraged... Yet here you're making dangerous changes to Bitcoin Core just so you'll save money on programmers.\n\nAs it is, it's not even clear _why_ your sidechain code would even benefit, and of course, that's currently non-opensource software that benefits no-one other than a secretive commercial company. You know, I personally am working on what you guys would call a sidechains implementation, and as I want to offer new functionality over Bitcoin it doesn't share any code at all with Bitcoin. Nor do I ask to have Bitcoin Core changed for the sake of my client's commercial venture.\n\nOf course, maybe I'm biased - I do spend almost all my time on Bitcoin Core reviewing, writing unit tests, and increasing code coverage rather than breaking things...\n",

Changing `if (integer)` to `if (integer != 0)` is\n> \"dangerous\"?\n\nLike I said, I'm referring to the impact of this work in totality; not specifically this one single change. I think you missed the intent above, which was _why_ you're arguing we need changes: ultimately for the sake of altcoins and sidechains more than Bitcoin Core's needs.\n\nAlso every line changed does incur precious review effort; arguing against does too, but that can pay dividends in the future.\n\nAnyway, I don't recall seeing either of you doing much work with the consensus critical code before, especially in testing it - reimplementing it is a good learning experience as well. You'll find your enthusiasm for changing it goes down greatly once you get more experience working with it.\n",

No. The C++ standard states that implicit conversion of integers to boolean values is performed by comparing against zero, which is done explicitly here. It solves problems for people who are working with other changes to bitcoin's codebase. The change is innocuous and makes someone's life easier. Why bring politics into the development process?\n\nAs to your ad hominum attacks, I suggest you take that elsewhere.\n",

Someone should really write that tool for \"identical-binary checking\" it will be very useful. \nAnyway, this seems a broader discussion that probably belongs to the mailing list. These changes are trivial (and thus not dangerous) and they're not changing consensus code but rather wallet and gui code.\nThe _why_ is rather simple too: move a little bit more towards type safety in amounts, a work that is not complete. It does benefit altcoins like freicoin saving it a couple of additional commits in the next rebase on top of bitcoin? Yes, so what?\nFreicoin's technical choice of maximizing the common codebase with Bitcoin benefits both projects by not fragmenting development unnecessarily. As an argument in favor of a change, benefiting codebases built on top of bitcoin may be a weak argument, but it should never be an argument against the change either.\n",

    "body": "I completely agree that the criterion for inclusion in Bitcoin Core should whether it benefits Bitcoin, and should be weighed against the risks it introduces for Bitcoin. And readable, robust, auditable, transparent, and more flexible code is a benefit too.\n\nRegarding this pull request in particular: it continues a transformation of the code to abstract the handling of monetary amounts. IMHO, low benefit, but given that it's trivial and not touching consensus code, also low risk.\n\nRegarding changing the type of monetary amounts: that's an idea that started a long time ago (see #4067, #4234, #4614, #5117, and #5308), and has had plenty of discussion. I believe the bottom line was that changing the type would make things clearer, but a separate class wouldn't outweigh the risks. Do we need to have that discussion again? (I don't want to use the \"this was discussed before, we should never ever come back to it!\" argument, but it does seem very late to bring this up).\n\nRegarding motivations and conflict of interest: you can't ask more than people being honest about why they want a change.\n",

    "body": "I do plan to submit more changes related to CAmount but since a class was not wanted I am precisely trying to isolate the changes that could easily be accepted (as I thought these trivial changes would be).\nI believe these changes are beneficial for Bitcoin or I wouldn't propose them here. Other people might disagree and I have stepped back in the past (like not proposing a pow class anymore). About other people maintaining codebases on top of Bitcoin, I suggest them to propose their changes to Bitcoin if they think they would improve Bitcoin (by improving its modularity and type safety, for example).\nBut that has to be judged on a case by case basis, not on a person by person basis.\nThis is not proposing to turn CAmount into a class (which is something I would agree with but was rejected), and although it's moving towards the type safety that you would achieve doing so, it cannot be judged as the same thing.\nBut if one thinks that a change being convenient for altcoins or sidechains maintenance is irrelevant for its acceptance shouldn't be insisting so much on it as if it were a reason not to do it.\nI think it's a weak advantage for this codebase but still an advantage in itself. Many people disagree. Fair enough, I'll not use it as an argument. But it is very frustrating to hear \"this will benefit a dependent codebase\" as an argument against a change. \nIt would be also interesting to understand better what was so wrong about using a class instead of a typedef. I think many of the concerns had to do just with changing many different parts of the code at once. I'm precisely separating the changes to find out what will be accepted and what not. Maintaining this tiny patch independently won't be a huge pain if it turns out that people think it doesn't benefit bitcoin/master.\nSo the question is only \"does replacing if(CAmount) with if(CAmount != 0) make the code more unambiguous, type-safe and/or clear?\".\nMy answer is yes to all 3 but if this is so controversial I can leave that commit for other codebases, no problem.\n",

IMO not because touching consensus should be avoided at all costs but because it what makes sense. Let's stop arguing about this, please.\n\n> The only reason to touch consensus code IMO is to either fix bugs or specifically change the behaviour on purpose.\n\nThis is a very different thing. \"Not doing X only because of A\", is very different from \"Not doing X unless it is because of B\".\nImproving modularity, reducing ambiguity, improving readability of code and maintenance in general are good things for Bitcoin's codebase. \nWe can argue in each case if the benefits outweigh the \"risks\" or not. \nIn particular, this PR does NOT touch consensus critical code and it contains trivial changes with no risks at all. \nBut if we want to discuss a general policy I don't think this is right place to do so.\n\n> OP is repeatedly proposing to touch consensus critical code to assist altcoin maintenance which is not only unnecessary, but downright dangerous.\n\nIf your opinion is that my contributions are unnecessary and downright dangerous I obviously disagree. \nYou're free to do what you can to block them one by one, but you will have to give different reasons for each different change. I'm sorry if you're \"generally concerned\" about my contributions but I don't think anybody should accept that as an argument against any of the tiny commits in this PR.\n\nPlease, let's talk about the PR or move to another forum like the mailing list. I hope that it doesn't become a conversation about concrete people again. We should trust good and easy-to-review changes rather than people's reputation or pgp-signed commits.\nIt is really disappointing that people prefer to talk about my intentions rather than being objective and unbiased about the advantages and risks of the changes themselves (which again, are not consensus critical nor dangerous).\n",

    "body": "> Rather the next step being advocated above as the followup - change consensus critical code by changing CAmount - is the issue.\n\nAgreed. I went along with the CAmount change in the consensus code under the following conditions:\n- `CAmount` would be a typedef for `uint64_t`, not a class or anything more complex\n- The binary would be unchanged. I checked this. There is AFAIK no tool for this that I know of but an exact sequence of steps I published that can be used, so that's an easy 250mBTC for anyone that can do a search\n\nThis pull is simply a continuation of that into some silly GUI and wallet code, so I don't think it should be controversial.\n",
