gmaxwell,2014-04-22T09:04:51Z,"As an aside you have some extraneous commits in this pull.\n\nCan you explain the motivations behind your main change?  The prior philosophy seems to have been to show the value pushed to the stack, not the specific encoding of the value. With your change one still can't distinguish the different pushdata forms and while the non-pushdata numbers are more clear, I'm concerned that it might be at th",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4080#issuecomment-41018216,41018216,
