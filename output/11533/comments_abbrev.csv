mikedennis,2017-11-12T19:38:12Z,I just went through this and did my own pull when I was pointed to the fact this one already exists. I'm not sure you need much additional doc around this at all. It's basically just install WSL and then follow linux instructions for whatever distro you install in the WSL. Worked great for me whereas I was unable to get it to work with the previous beta WSL.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11533#issuecomment-343761397,343761397,

I would, however, recommend the following modifications to the documentation:\n* In depends build mention you cannot build via mnt or else will get an error with automake\n* I needed to change to posix compilers even though I'm running Ubuntu 16.04.
