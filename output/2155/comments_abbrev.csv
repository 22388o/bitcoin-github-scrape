gmaxwell,2013-01-07T16:22:42Z,In my own python scripts I've never been clear about this— and hand't bothered to try to test it— can the cast from Decimal to float and then transmission to bitcoind result in turning 1e-8 BTC to fees due to rounding?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2155#issuecomment-11958162,11958162,

Checking for that is a good idea:  ""information about the precision and internal representation of floating point numbers for the machine on which your program is running is available in sys.float_info.""\n\n... or maybe more straightforward (and more easily portable to other languages) would be a check routine th",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2155#issuecomment-11960899,11960899,
gavinandresen,2013-01-07T18:31:18Z,Closing this for now; I found a nasty bug doing more testing (on testnet-- using same address as input and output could lose coins to fees).\n\nI'm going to rework to sanity-check fees on the final transaction and write a test plan.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2155#issuecomment-11963999,11963999,
