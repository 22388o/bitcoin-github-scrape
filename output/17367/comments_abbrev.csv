laanwj,2019-11-06 13:55:37,"What is this host define used for?\nCould this be auto-detected (if not explicitly set for cross-build) instead of assumed?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17367#discussion_r343106368,343106368,ci/test/00_setup_env.sh
MarcoFalke,2019-11-06 14:18:01,"The host is passed down to depends and then used there to cross compile. Also, it is used to name the distdir folder.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17367#discussion_r343118150,343118150,ci/test/00_setup_env.sh

MarcoFalke,2019-11-06 14:19:31,So I am not sure if it makes sense to add auto-detect code to pick the right temporary name,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17367#discussion_r343118898,343118898,ci/test/00_setup_env.sh
laanwj,2019-11-06 14:21:03,"It does look too much like ""hardcoding an architecture"" to me, which the point of this PR is to avoid. If it's only used to name a folder, can't we name it something architecture-independent?
