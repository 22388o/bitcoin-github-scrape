tcatm,2011-11-11T01:04:26Z,"NACK I agree with deprecating getblocknumber, however deprecation should not remove it from pCallTable yet. This would be a seperate patch for a later version. You should add comments like ""// deprecated"" to the calltable entry and the function itself so we can easily remove the code later.\n\nmidstate and hash1 are an example of RPC features that are deprecated but not removed yet.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/632#issuecomment-2703697,2703697,
