Suffice,2013-05-31T22:37:46Z,"This is the one of the most arbitrary and needless things I've seen to be implemented. It's so incredibly unlikely that anyone will ever have even 10 million, let alone all 21 million. What's the point in setting a hard input limit to that? Or any limit for that matter? If someone wants to try to send a bazillion bitcoins, let them.

They should have the freedom to try, and have the chance to spot where it went wrong by seeing a highlighted field. I don't really see a 21'000'000 limit on a field supposed to be limited to 21'000'000 as _arbitrary_.\n\nAs I stated before, this feature is not of first i",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2679#issuecomment-18775952,18775952,
