MarcoFalke,2021-11-09 11:59:23,"Yeah, it is a trade-off. If there is a CI failure, it will be good to know the result as early as possible after opening the pull request. If there is more time, it will be good to know all tests that failed.\n\nIdeally the ci infrastructure could be marked red during a run. Then the run would continue with the remaining tests.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22980#issuecomment-964085922,964085922,
