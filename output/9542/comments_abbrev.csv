JeremyRubin,2017-01-13T15:02:55Z,"This is not really critical, but as jtimon points out there is a lot of confusion over ""Trivial"" tags for PR's. \n\n\nI think that we'd save ourselves a lot of grief if we adopted a policy that was more in line with how people typically (and in many other projects) use ""trivial"" tags.

jtimon,2017-01-24T00:20:56Z,"@JeremyRubin explained my perspective very well.\nI use the trivial tag to make code changes that should be trivial to review and don't change functionality, maybe even for things like #9176. If it takes more than a few minutes to review, I think ""NACK this is not trivial"" or ""Nit remove the trivial label, this is not trivial"".\n Anyway, should have left this comments some time ago and what has ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9542#issuecomment-274661770,274661770,

jnewbery,2017-01-13T21:15:59Z,"yep - labels can be used by maintainers to correctly categorize the issues/PRs (and contain many other categories such as 'Questions and Help', 'Upstream', etc).
