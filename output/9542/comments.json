    "body": "This is not really critical, but as jtimon points out there is a lot of confusion over \"Trivial\" tags for PR's. \r\n\r\n\r\nI think that we'd save ourselves a lot of grief if we adopted a policy that was more in line with how people typically (and in many other projects) use \"trivial\" tags. Changing the contributing.md isn't going to change what people making their first PR do, as they may not have even read that. Usually, a trivial tag refers to a PR that either changes only document to fix typos or is a minor code change that is easily reviewable and has no visible behavior change.\r\n\r\nFor example, I would tag the code\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nint a = 1+1;\r\n```\r\nto\r\n```c++\r\nint a = 2;\r\n```\r\n\r\nas a Trivial change\r\n\r\nbut not something like\r\n\r\n```c++\r\natomic_int a = 1;\r\n++a;\r\n```\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n```c++\r\natomic_int a = 0;\r\n++a;\r\n++a;\r\n```\r\n\r\nas there is a small behavior change if someone else (from another thread observing a) would see a difference. Other sorts of things I would tag as Trivial are namespace visibility, de-duplication, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nI think the other benefit of using \"Trivial\" to tag something that you think is trivial is that it is an assertion that the PR does not have any major affect, and if someone does see that it does have an effect then the PR should not be accepted (or at least re-thought).\r\n\r\nFor things that are \"Trivial\" in the sense @jnewbery is proposing, perhaps we can use either \"DocOnly\", \"Typo\", or \"NonCode\" as tags.\r\n\r\n\r\nedit: I think ultimately it comes down to however @laanwj wants to manage it, but it would be nice to have a tag that means \"Trivial\" in the sense I am suggestion. (\"Minor\"? \"Obvious\"?)\r\n",
