Diapolo,2012-04-04T07:15:05Z,"I we want this before 0.7 I could do this via transifex and a copy & paste of the translated word ""Wallet"" for the used languages directly from the current lang-files. Before I would create a pull for the new en master file, so tf can fetch it from here.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1032#issuecomment-4948462,4948462,

Diapolo,2012-05-04T22:49:19Z,"As we have 0.6.1 final released I would like to get this merged asap, so we can rely on the translators :). Transifex just needs an updated en master file afterwards.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1032#issuecomment-5521995,5521995,
