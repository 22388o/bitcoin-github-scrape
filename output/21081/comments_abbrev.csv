You should work on top of latest version of master to avoid these merge commits but you may be able to resolve this by [squashing commits](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#squashing-commits)",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21081#issuecomment-773292516,773292516,
