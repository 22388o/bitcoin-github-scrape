jgarzik,2011-03-29T21:00:31Z,"Comments:\n\n1) The community poll and I seem to agree, upnp should be disabled by default (USE_UPNP==0)\n\n2) Rather than all those ifdefs, it would be nice to define  'static const fHaveUPNP' and test that where possible.  The compiler will optimize out code that is known never to be called.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/133#issuecomment-933178,933178,
