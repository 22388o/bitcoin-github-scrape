sipa,2018-11-10T03:45:04Z,I'm confused; these changes look like things that were in 0.17 already; they shouldn't go into master's release-notes (which will be for 0.18).,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14688#issuecomment-437555598,437555598,

harding,2018-11-10T15:34:28Z,"@sipa it looks like you're correct, sorry about that. There was a large number of ""backports"" to 0.17 after the branch point but before the release so I didn't realize that they'd been backported.  For example, 0f681cecadb9472b3d3ae2c1dd23d8173dc2e316 was the backport that put the descriptors.md file into 0.17, meaning it isn't actually new as this PR indicates.\n\nI'll check everything, make th",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14688#issuecomment-437592118,437592118,
MarcoFalke,2018-11-10T15:46:32Z,"The document has been backported, but it hasn't been mentioned in the release notes back then. Since it is not possible to change release notes after the release, we could not mention it at all, mention it on the 0.17.1 release, or on the master branch...?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14688#issuecomment-437592957,437592957,
harding,2018-11-10T15:55:12Z,"@MarcoFalke the document has been extended in recent commits that I think are unique to master, so I was thinking about just slightly revising my current description to say the document has been updated rather than saying it's new.

harding,2018-11-11T12:17:36Z,"This is ready for review again.  I've reviewed each line added in this PR to determine whether the relevant code change was backported to the 0.17 branch (as of its current tip, 5150accdd2a7c7f0edf964d56bd7d34b5f740cdc) and made the necessary changes---which only affected one item: I've relabeled the output script descriptors documentation as updated (not new) and moved its position in the list do",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14688#issuecomment-437665442,437665442,
