The option will now by default be off for improved privacy and security\n as well as reduced upload usage. The option can explicitly be turned on for\n local-network debugging purposes.\n \n-Example item\n+Documentation\n+-------------\n+\n+- A new short\n+  [document](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/JSON-RPC-interface.md)\n+  about the JSON-RPC interface describes cases where the results of an\n+  RPC might contain inconsistencies between data sourced from different\n+  subsystems, such as wallet state and mempool state.  A note is added\n+  to the [REST interface documentation](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/REST-interface.md)\n+  indicating that the same rules apply.\n+\n+- A new [document](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/bitcoin-conf.md)\n+  about the `bitcoin.conf` file describes how to use it to configure\n+  Bitcoin Core.\n+\n+- A new document introduces Bitcoin Core's BIP174\n+  [Partially-Signed Bitcoin Transactions (PSBT)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/psbt.md)\n+  interface, which is used to allow multiple programs to collaboratively\n+  work to create, sign, and broadcast new transactions.  This is useful\n+  for offline (cold storage) wallets, multisig wallets, coinjoin\n+  implementations, and many other cases where two or more programs need\n+  to interact to generate a complete transaction.\n+\n+- The [output script descriptor](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/descriptors.md)\n+  documentation has been updated with information about new features in\n+  this still-developing language for describing the output scripts that\n+  a wallet or other program wants to receive notifications for, such as\n+  which addresses it wants to know received payments.  The language is\n+  currently used in the `scantxoutset` RPC and is expected to be adapted\n+  to other RPCs and to the underlying wallet structure.\n+\n+Build system changes\n+--------------------\n+\n+- A new `--disable-bip70` option may be passed to `./configure` to\n+  prevent Bitcoin-Qt from being built with support for the BIP70 payment\n+  protocol or from linking libssl.  As the payment protocol has exposed\n+  Bitcoin Core to libssl vulnerabilities in the past, builders who don't\n+  need BIP70 support are encouraged to use this option to reduce their\n+  exposure to future vulnerabilities.\n+\n+Updated RPCs\n ------------\n \n+- The `signrawtransaction` RPC is removed after being deprecated and\n+  hidden behind a special configuration option in version 0.17.0.\n+\n+- The `getpeerinfo` RPC now returns an additional \"minfeefilter\" field\n+  set to the peer's BIP133 fee filter.  You can use this to detect that\n+  you have peers that are willing to accept transactions below the\n+  default minimum relay fee.\n+\n+- The mempool RPCs, such as `getrawmempool` with `verbose=true`, now\n+  return an additional \"bip125-replaceable\" value indicating whether the\n+  transaction (or its unconfirmed ancestors) opts-in to asking nodes and\n+  miners to replace it with a higher-feerate transaction spending any of\n+  the same inputs.\n+\n+- The `settxfee` RPC previously silently ignored attempts to set the fee\n+  below the allowed minimums.  It now prints a warning.  The special\n+  value of \"0\" may still be used to request the minimum value.\n+\n+- The `getaddressinfo` RPC now provides an `ischange` field indicating\n+  whether the wallet used the address in a change output.\n+\n+Low-level changes\n+=================\n+\n+RPC\n+---\n+\n+- The `submitblock` RPC previously returned the reason a rejected block\n+  was invalid the first time it processed that block but returned a\n+  generic \"duplicate\" rejection message on subsequent occasions it\n+  processed the same block.  It now always returns the fundamental\n+  reason for rejecting an invalid block and only returns \"duplicate\" for\n+  valid blocks it has already accepted.\n+\n+- A new `submitheader` RPC allows submitting block headers independently\n+  from their block.  This is likely only useful for testing.\n+\n Credits\n =======\n "
