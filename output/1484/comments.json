    "body": "A very small number of people care about a precompiled bitcoind on the Mac; I don't think it is worth the extra build time or hassle of fetching/building dependencies.\n\nSo I think this should wait until there's a gitian-built OSX Bitcoin-Qt release working.  Nice work, though, I'm impressed you got osx bitcoind cross-compiling....\n",
