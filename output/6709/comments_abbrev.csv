jonasschnelli,2015-09-22T07:52:16Z,@MarcoFalke is right. The `*.ts` changes are useless. They need to be made at https://www.transifex.com/bitcoin.\n\nAlso please use https://github.com/theuni/bitcoin for trivial non-code changes to avoid trivial PR overflow in the main repository.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6709#issuecomment-142205867,142205867,
