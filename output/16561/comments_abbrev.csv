practicalswift,2019-08-08 06:10:19,@promag Good point -- I thought about that but I'm not sure `sys.stdout.isatty()` holds `True` in Travis where we want the dots at least. I'll investigate :-),https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16561#issuecomment-519380051,519380051,
practicalswift,2019-08-15 08:31:15,@promag Turns out `sys.stdout.isatty()` holds `True` also in Travis. Updated PR. Would you mind re-reviewing? :-),https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16561#issuecomment-521560921,521560921,

promag,2019-08-15 09:53:33,Yeah my suggestion was to use isatty value as the option default value.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16561#discussion_r314244447,314244447,test/functional/test_runner.py
