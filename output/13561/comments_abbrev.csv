droark,2018-10-10T19:02:04Z,"Hmmm. Still getting an error when cross-compiling. In particular, toCGImage() still requires QtMacExtras, and the underlying code seems to tap into a private Qt API that we have no business using. (Besides, it fails as-is.) This PR may need some rethinking. Anybody have any ideas? The cleanest thing to do would be to cross-compile QtMacExtras.
