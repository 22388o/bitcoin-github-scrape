laanwj,2013-05-26T11:39:03Z,"The reason for being overly specific is to show the _exact_ format in which the version has to be given. I have been known for adding v's in front where there should not be, for example. If you do this, specify exactly what format is expected.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2697#issuecomment-18461755,18461755,

Michagogo,2013-05-26T11:45:47Z,"@Laanwj Ah, I see what you're saying. When I get back to my computer I'll take a look and see if I can think of a way to demonstrate... The fact that it can be more than just numbers (i.e. 0.8.2rc3, not just 0.8.2) is important to clarify, IMHO. Also, I agree with you that it can be confusing regarding where you should and shouldn't prepend a `v' -- I'm not sure why it belongs in some places and n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2697#issuecomment-18461834,18461834,
laanwj,2013-05-26T11:50:26Z,"For me the current phrasing is fine, as it says ""for example"" and 0.8.0 is just an example. You could make it 0.8.0rc3 to show that the rc, if relevant, also needs to be added.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2697#issuecomment-18461880,18461880,
Michagogo,2013-05-26T13:59:39Z,"@laanwj The current phrasing doesn't say ""for example"", it provides values. IMHO, it should be like with the ""export SIGNER="" line, making it clear that this is somewhere to fill in your own file. I've tweaked it a bit.
