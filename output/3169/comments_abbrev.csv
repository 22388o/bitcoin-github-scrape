Diapolo,2013-10-28T07:06:12Z,"Seems I still have problems understanding your idea ^^. Take a look at this line, BitcoinGUI subscribing to clientModel. Your idea is WalletView -> WalletModel is logical and BitcoinGUI -> ClientModel also then? I'm fine with closing this pull, as long as I'm able to follow you :).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3169#discussion_r7241106,7241106,src/qt/bitcoingui.cpp

laanwj,2013-10-28T09:51:39Z,"Where that could come in useful is, for example, if we'd want to store the messages on a per-wallet basis. The walletview could do something else with the messages for a specific wallet.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3169#discussion_r7243399,7243399,src/qt/bitcoingui.cpp
