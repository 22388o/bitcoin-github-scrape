NicolasDorier,2017-03-22T05:37:21Z,"NACK on ""Coin Selection Failed"". It would break existing code (I rely in some project on the Insufficient Funds message), and I think ""Insufficient funds"" is correct. If you can't create a transaction because the chain is too long, then you really do not have enough liquidity.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10015#issuecomment-288303520,288303520,
jnewbery,2017-03-22T12:47:36Z,"@NicolasDorier I strongly disagree with your definition of 'liquidity' here. In the too-long-chains case, the coin selection is being rejected by *local* policy. If the user was able to get the transaction to a miner who was prepared to mine a long chain, then it would be a perfectly valid transaction. I also think the most obvious reading of ""insufficient funds"" is that there are not enough funds",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10015#issuecomment-288387822,288387822,
NicolasDorier,2017-03-23T02:13:25Z,"@jnewbery well in my case, the Insufficient Fee is interpreted into a proper Enum value in my client code.\nMaking this change mean that my code will throw a UnknownException, interpreted like a bug, instead of a Insufficient Fee, which delay the same action for later.

Better an aspecific error than an incorrect one though. An incorrect ""insufficient funds"" error could set the caller on a wild goose chase or get them to panic.
