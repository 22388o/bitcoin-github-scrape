This is not 1980.\n\nAre you sure Qt has no functionality to automatically wordwrap tooltips?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1088#issuecomment-5108639,5108639,

The file was formatted correctly in Qt Linguist and in Bitcoin, too. Besides they seem to have fixed that glitch now, but I'm not sure",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1088#issuecomment-5109362,5109362,
laanwj,2012-04-13T07:20:42Z,"Thanks for looking that up. We will handle the wordwrap issue in the code instead of the individual translations, by making sure all the tooltips are detected as rich text.\n\nI've applied the other part of this pull.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1088#issuecomment-5109677,5109677,
