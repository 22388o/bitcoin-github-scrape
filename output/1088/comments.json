    "body": "> According to @Diapolo transifex has problems with \\n in messages, they tend to get lost in translations.\n\nI had remarked this with the content of the About Bitcoin-Qt window but it was apparently just a rendering issue of translated strings on Transifex's side. The file was formatted correctly in Qt Linguist and in Bitcoin, too. Besides they seem to have fixed that glitch now, but I'm not sure so don't take it as granted.\n\n> Are you sure Qt has no functionality to automatically wordwrap tooltips?\n\nI'm just a translator, I don't know much about coding but apparently if Qt considers the content of the tooltip as plain text it won't care about its length. However, if it thinks it deals with rich text it will wrap the content. Adding a < br> tag or < font color=black>lorem ipsum< /font> does the trick although it's not very elegant.\n\nSo you may remove the 3 \"\\n\" from the patch until you decide how you want to manage this tooltip issue.\n",
