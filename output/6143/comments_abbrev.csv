paveljanik,2015-05-15T09:16:29Z,"Hmm, looks like I was looking at the older version of the file ;-)\nIt is clear from the current version. I do not like these #ifdefs all around one file though. But your change really fixes the problem introduced, so ACK.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6143#issuecomment-102336066,102336066,
laanwj,2015-05-15T09:56:47Z,"I'm not too happy about this. If the code can compile on all platforms the compiler should do it, this makes it less likely that someone will push code that doesn't work on all platforms. \n\nI'm sure there is another way to disable the warning (one is to make the function non-static).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6143#issuecomment-102351290,102351290,
luke-jr,2015-05-15T16:24:36Z,"Making it non-static is liable to cause the binaries to be unnecessarily larger too. If we want to disable unused code warnings, I'm sure there's a compiler option for that.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6143#issuecomment-102452572,102452572,
theuni,2015-05-15T16:34:23Z,"These should really all be runtime checks anyway.\n\nAs for making it non-static, anon namespace is the c++ way to handle that. That lets the compiler know that if it's not used in the compilation unit, it's safe to prune.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6143#issuecomment-102454385,102454385,
laanwj,2015-05-16T08:42:56Z,Agree that an anonymous namespace is the way to go.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6143#issuecomment-102590220,102590220,

jonasschnelli,2015-05-17T07:03:53Z,"What about wrapping L16-L24 with the #ifdefs and remove the ifdef at L30 below?\nThis will probably remove the warning, keep the amounts of ifdefs.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6143#discussion_r30468025,30468025,src/qt/scicon.cpp
laanwj,2015-05-18T06:12:15Z,"The point is not to reduce the _number_ of ifdefs, but to require the compiler to compile the largest possible share of the code on all platforms.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6143#discussion_r30483404,30483404,src/qt/scicon.cpp
