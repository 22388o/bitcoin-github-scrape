promag,2021-10-18 20:34:07,@meshcollider does it make sense to fail instead?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23113#issuecomment-946143677,946143677,
meshcollider,2021-10-18 21:38:55,"@promag I don't think so personally, a warning is sufficient IMO.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23113#issuecomment-946188348,946188348,
laanwj,2021-09-28 13:39:10,I think it would make sense to make warnings an array of strings.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23113#discussion_r717587497,717587497,src/rpc/misc.cpp

achow101,2021-09-29 19:07:24,"Warnings array is also preferable to me. There are a few other RPCs which return warnings array, and I think we should move to doing that more.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23113#discussion_r718806970,718806970,src/rpc/misc.cpp
