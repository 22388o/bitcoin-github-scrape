I know many people who will be running around telling everyone to run with this option, but it is way too early to do that. If suddenly a large chunk of the network starts using this option many clients that haven't had a chance to upgrade yet will suddenly break, which I think is an absolutely terrible outcome. Further, this absolutely doesn't help with testing anything... It's pretty disingenuous to claim that anyone wants this to assist in testing anything since the future behavior can be enabled by using the latest version number.\n\nIt's not like the various bloom-related DoS issues aren't thoroughly discussed in public already anyway, but those can be fixed directly (ie with the mempool-call-limits Greg was suggesting, maybe in conjunction with a similar limit on block requests).\n\nOn November 24, 2015 12:14:42 AM PST, MarcoFalke notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> It seems this conflicts with #6641\n> \n> ---\n> \n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\n> https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7087#issuecomment-159191468\n",

I think f2pool bans any non-white-listed clients by subver but I'm not sure how different that disconnect implementation is. Another pool operator just iptables bans SPV clients when they start using resources.  We will likely always have some non-upgraded SPV clients regardless and this would be useful for testing how best to disconnect them.\n",

My point is more, if this patch is merged, people who are not experiencing issues with bloom filter-based load will start enabling it, potentially causing serious issues to virtually all deployed SPV clients. If I thought no one was going to go around telling people to use this option (it not be listed even with -debug, IMO) then I'd be mostly OK with it, but I'm rather confident that is not the case.\n",

Still, that does not mean this will not break things without giving them almost any time to get an upgrade deployed (bitcoinj isnt the only SPV implementation anymore...has anyone done a census of how each behaves?). Further, no one has suggested serious justification for doing this now instead of waiting in this PR (aside from \"I dont want to have to merge this patch regularly myself), so I'm kinda confused as to why people are pushing hard to do this.\n",

The fact that half the people commenting on this PR are running a similar patch on their own nodes is sufficient evidence to me that a bunch of people will enable this option even when they aren't facing active DoS issues.\n\nIn any case, yes, only returning NODE_BLOOM nodes from the DNS seeds is an option, though I dont particularly want to do that since they arent only used for bloom-based SPV clients.

However, another comment already indicated breadwallet seems to get into a reconnect loop.\n\nThat was cleared up a post later, when it was revealed that he was explicitly telling the software to connect to his node. Retrying is the expected behavior (what if the node is 'fixed' in the meantime?). Sure, exponential back-off would be nice, but it's beside the point.\n\nI'll be frank about the reason I want this in: to be able to tell people to use this option when bloom filter is used in a DoS attack on the network or on them personally. This has been the case, and having them install a patch is impractical (and for promises about mitigation using request limits and such it's too late for 0.12 - feature freeze is in less than a week).\n\nApart from that it is an obscure, unadvertised, undocumented option, and I don't expect anyone besides a few 'obsessive performance tweakers' to actually enable it.\n",

    "body": "As far as the concern that miners may turn this on and that maybe their nodes are a substantial fraction of the network: In 0.12 they can set the upload limiter, which will disconnect lite wallets most of the time just as much as this will.\n\nIf it becomes the case that people dig up the hidden open and are turning this on and causing problems we can respond by starting up more nodes and setting dnsseeds to filter results; it would be a pain but no great harm; and I think a pretty reasonable risk all considered. Consider instead: what happens if bloom based DOS attacks become much more common? The fix there will be for everyone to upgrade their software. Thats much more of a pain.\n",

I've done experiments where I had bitcoind in a restart loop every few minutes, then compared which nodes were reconnecting, I'm fairly sure I've seen that behavior only with spy nodes.\n",

Breadwallet will choose a new random node for each reconnect attempt, and after 20 failed attempts in a row it will stop and display \"not connected\" in the UI, and wait for the user to manually initiate another 20 reconnect attempts to random nodes. It also keeps track of nodes that don't provide expected responses and marks them as misbehaving (not for network connect issues though). I'm also happy to take suggestions for improvements.\n",
