The attack this is designed to stop is if I know that the address 1BPmZt3kjnFffANNs6MCBBBKRYwRGGrXQZ is part of Alice's wallet, it shouldn't be possible to continually pepper it with dust and learn more about her as her wallet automatically keeps spend-linking it with her other outgoing transactions.",

For instance, let's say I request someone sends me money to address X and they do so.\r\n\r\nI can't immediately use `freezeaddress` because doing so would stop me spending the coins. I'd have to wait until the coins left address X and then freeze it. But that's rather annoying to do, and leaves open the reuse problem until I've spent all the money.\r\n\r\nAlso I don't think using the configuration is appropriate for a list of frozen addresses. It's highly dynamic and often huge (I personally have half a million addresses I'd like to freeze).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI think a better way of solving the problem would be to extend the locked outputs. I think making them persistent would be a good first step (it's rather annoying that locked outputs aren't already persistent). And then the configuration option to disable address reuse could automatically lock any outputs you got, if the associated address has already been used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "> I believe the only time one needs to worry about taint inputs is after a spend from that address happens, so long as the spends make sure to spend all (non-dust) coins paid to that address so far.\r\n\r\nThat's a good point, but from a pragmatic point of view I think it's not worth it. It comes at a terrible cost to coin selection (instead of picking from a set of outputs, it's going to have to pick from a set of sets). And coin selection in core is already one of the weakest parts, I don't favor making it any harder to deal with.\r\n\r\nAnd keep in mind that if we're trying to prevent someone dusting the wallet that dust (even when it's standard) is a *lot* more expensive to spend than it contains.  (As dust is based on the tiny relayfee, but the wallet typically uses a feerate of >100x more than that when creating transactions).\r\n\r\nSo I think for simplicity, it makes a lot more sense to just lock the output immediately instead of delaying it at the cost of putting fancy logic in the coin selection as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "> That's a good point, but from a pragmatic point of view I think it's not worth it. It comes at a terrible cost to coin selection (instead of picking from a set of outputs, it's going to have to pick from a set of sets). \r\n\r\nWith due respect, I think you're handwaving here -- and that isn't a way to accomplish anything.  Doing anything less then treating all spendable coins paid to an address as a single unit is a guaranteed privacy failure... and I don't believe this would add_any_ complexity to coin selection-- the \"coin\" you select over is just the effect of spending the whole group... though it would make corner cases where we mishandle dust payments a bit more obvious, but those need to be addressed regardless.\r\n\r\n>  And coin selection in core is already one of the weakest parts,\r\n\r\nCan you suggest _ANY_ piece of software that does better?

This would create a trivial attack if widely used-- I see payments to new address and I quickly pay dust.   Now the actual payment is 'locked' and all you'll spend is the dust.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is avoided if the horizon for locking is immediately prior to spending, since an attacker cannot race that.  I think it would also turn the feature from an exotic and difficult to support thing to something we could reasonably make a default, at least once there were the right UI features for handling the held balance.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n",

But if it's smarter, then there's a different cost to adding different amounts of inputs (i.e. adding two 5 BTC inputs is going to cost more than adding 10 BTC input).\r\n\r\nAlso how do you propose it handles an address that also has uneconomical to spend outputs?\r\n\r\n> Can you suggest ANY piece of software that does better? (A lot of other things do provably worse, see e.g. the study published at the last scaling bitcoin...)\r\n\r\nI haven't seen the study. But core's just tries to minimize the amount of the change output, which strikes me as a little bizarre and a privacy nightmare (>99% of the time, the change is trivially identifiable). It also conflates utxo consolidation with coin selection (which I agree is what most normal users wallet want), and it routinely adds inputs that cost more to spend than they add.\r\n\r\nBut anyway, I've been able to save well *over* 70% on transaction fees with a [trivial patch to core](https://github.com/RHavar/bitcoin/commit/6452fbc751f5ee6ac4ab38855bf9c3654caf6dfe) and a utxo consolidation cron job, which translates to over a thousand dollars a month.  Not that it is suitable for normal users, but it clearly shows bitcoin's coin selection is not nearly \"optimal\" and that one size doesn't fit all. \r\n\r\nThat said, you make a convincing case about avoiding the attack vector. I just hope it's not one of those cases where the perfect solution is so much work that no one bothers doing it, while they would've been happy doing the good one. =)\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "Oh by no means do I think the behavior is anywhere near optimal, but to me it sounded you were opposing fixing it in favor of more special purpose options. The amount of configurables is already a major burden in improving the software already.  Damn, I really wish your answer had been \"I think X does it perfectly.\" :P\r\n\r\n> But core's just tries to minimize the amount of the change output, \r\n\r\nHeh. If it just did that it would be a lot simpler.   Instead its actual objective probably takes a page of text to explain.    The main goal, such as it is, is best understood as privacy optimizing under a strong assumption that addresses are not reused-- this assumption is just outright wrong, but if you look at it in that light its behavior makes more sense. It tries to move as little of your coins at a time as it can to avoid linking the payments.   Beyond that, it tries to make change outputs (if there is change) large enough to be meaningfully useful in the future. (0.01 btc-ish is the current target).\r\n\r\nI think It's far too hesitant to throw a bit of dust away when doing so would really improve the result (e.g. avoiding a change output at all)...   Maybe the upcoming improvements in the fee estimator will make it easier to come up with a reliable estimate of \"effectively dust\" rather than just using the relay fee.\r\n\r\n> But if it's smarter, then there's a different cost to adding different amounts of inputs (i.e. adding two 5 BTC inputs is going to cost more than adding 10 BTC input)\r\n\r\nDepends on what fees are now relative to the future, absent other information (like knowing you're going to make consolidation transactions during lower feerate times) it's probably generally the case that we should prefer to spend coins eagerly at least when doing so won't gum up privacy-- simply because generally we expect fees to not be lower in the future; but right now it's not eager because it assumes all addresses are independent.\r\n\r\nMore eager policies are also good for the long term because w/ aggregation in the future it will be cheaper to spend more inputs at a time, even ignoring the commons benefit.\r\n\r\n> Also how do you propose it handles an address that also has uneconomical to spend outputs?\r\n\r\nSpend a small amount of them anyways (I doubt many users would mind being a little civically minded-- and paying a tiny bit more in their transactions to remove dust, especially if they're break-even to spend vs a loss), and if there are many ignore them like received after the fact coins-- so that they don't become attractive attack vector.\r\n\r\nE.g. specific implementation would be to go through the available scriptpubkeys (or taint groups, though that functionality is less useful now that coinjoin obfuscates them somewhat)  which haven't been marked frozen and gather up all their economical to spend outputs, plus up to one or two extra outputs which aren't economical from that spk and treat it as a single input for the purpose of the rest of the selection.  Then when a transaction is sent, mark all the involved SPKs as frozen (probably need a better term than frozen, since it sounds like a third party adverse action rather than a privacy feature). \r\n\r\n",
