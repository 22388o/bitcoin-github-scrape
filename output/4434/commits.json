OpenSSL has been updated because of a security issue (CVE-2014-0224).\n+Upgrading to this release is recommended.\n+\n+Please report bugs using the issue tracker at github:\n+\n+  https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues\n+\n+How to Upgrade\n+--------------\n+\n+If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely\n+shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the\n+installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on Mac) or\n+bitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux).\n+\n+If you are upgrading from version 0.7.2 or earlier, the first time you run\n+0.9.2.1 your blockchain files will be re-indexed, which will take anywhere from \n+30 minutes to several hours, depending on the speed of your machine.\n+\n+Downgrading warnings\n+--------------------\n+\n+The 'chainstate' for this release is not always compatible with previous\n+releases, so if you run 0.9.x and then decide to switch back to a\n+0.8.x release you might get a blockchain validation error when starting the\n+old release (due to 'pruned outputs' being omitted from the index of\n+unspent transaction outputs).\n+\n+Running the old release with the -reindex option will rebuild the chainstate\n+data structures and correct the problem.\n+\n+Also, the first time you run a 0.8.x release on a 0.9 wallet it will rescan\n+the blockchain for missing spent coins, which will take a long time (tens\n+of minutes on a typical machine).\n+\n+Important changes\n+==================\n+\n+Gitian OSX build\n+-----------------\n+\n+The deterministic build system that was already used for Windows and Linux\n+builds is now used for OSX as well. Although the resulting executables have\n+been tested quite a bit, there could be possible regressions. Be sure to report\n+these on the Github bug tracker mentioned above.\n+\n+Compatibility of Linux build\n+-----------------------------\n+\n+For Linux we now build against Qt 4.6, and filter the symbols for libstdc++ and glibc.\n+This brings back compatibility with\n+\n+- Debian 6+ / Tails\n+- Ubuntu 10.04\n+- CentOS 6.5\n+\n+0.9.2 - 0.9.2.1 Release notes\n+=======================\n+\n+The OpenSSL dependency in the gitian builds has been upgraded to 1.0.1h because of CVE-2014-0224.\n+\n+RPC:\n+\n+- Add `getwalletinfo`, `getblockchaininfo` and `getnetworkinfo` calls (will replace hodge-podge `getinfo` at some point)\n+- Add a `relayfee` field to `getnetworkinfo`\n+- Fix RPC related shutdown hangs and leaks\n+- Always show syncnode in `getpeerinfo`\n+- `sendrawtransaction`: report the reject code and reason, and make it possible to re-send transactions that are already in the mempool\n+- `getmininginfo` show right genproclimit\n+\n+Command-line options:\n+\n+- Fix `-printblocktree` output\n+- Show error message if ReadConfigFile fails\n+\n+Block-chain handling and storage:\n+\n+- Fix for GetBlockValue() after block 13,440,000 (BIP42)\n+- Upgrade leveldb to 1.17\n+\n+Protocol and network code:\n+\n+- Per-peer block download tracking and stalled download detection\n+- Add new DNS seed from bitnodes.io\n+- Prevent socket leak in ThreadSocketHandler and correct some proxy related socket leaks\n+- Use pnode->nLastRecv as sync score (was the wrong way around)\n+\n+Wallet:\n+\n+- Make GetAvailableCredit run GetHash() only once per transaction (performance improvement)\n+- Lower paytxfee warning threshold from 0.25 BTC to 0.01 BTC\n+- Fix importwallet nTimeFirstKey (trigger necessary rescans)\n+- Log BerkeleyDB version at startup\n+- CWallet init fix\n+\n+Build system:\n+\n+- Add OSX build descriptors to gitian\n+- Fix explicit --disable-qt-dbus\n+- Don't require db_cxx.h when compiling with wallet disabled and GUI enabled\n+- Improve missing boost error reporting\n+- Upgrade miniupnpc version to 1.9\n+- gitian-linux: --enable-glibc-back-compat for binary compatibility with old distributions\n+- gitian: don't export any symbols from executable\n+- gitian: build against Qt 4.6\n+- devtools: add script to check symbols from Linux gitian executables\n+- Remove build-time no-IPv6 setting\n+\n+GUI:\n+\n+- Fix various coin control visual issues\n+- Show number of in/out connections in debug console\n+- Show weeks as well as years behind for long timespans behind\n+- Enable and disable the Show and Remove buttons for requested payments history based on whether any entry is selected.\n+- Show also value for options overridden on command line in options dialog\n+- Fill in label from address book also for URIs\n+- Fixes feel when resizing the last column on tables (issue #2862)\n+- Fix ESC in disablewallet mode\n+- Add expert section to wallet tab in optionsdialog\n+- Do proper boost::path conversion (fixes unicode in datadir)\n+- Only override -datadir if different from the default (fixes -datadir in config file)\n+- Show rescan progress at start-up\n+- Show importwallet progress\n+- Get required locks upfront in polling functions (avoids hanging on locks)\n+- Catch Windows shutdown events while client is running\n+- Optionally add third party links to transaction context menu\n+- Check for !pixmap() before trying to export QR code (avoids crashes when no QR code could be generated)\n+- Fix \"Start bitcoin on system login\"\n+\n+Miscellaneous:\n+\n+- Replace non-threadsafe C functions (gmtime, strerror and setlocale)\n+- Add missing cs_main and wallet locks\n+- Avoid exception at startup when system locale not recognized\n+- Changed bitrpc.py's raw_input to getpass for passwords to conceal characters during command line input\n+- devtools: add a script to fetch and postprocess translations\n+\n+Credits\n+--------\n+\n+Thanks to everyone who contributed to this release:\n+\n+- Addy Yeow\n+- Altoidnerd\n+- Andrea D'Amore\n+- Andreas Schildbach\n+- Bardi Harborow\n+- Brandon Dahler\n+- Bryan Bishop\n+- Chris Beams\n+- Christian von Roques\n+- Cory Fields\n+- Cozz Lovan\n+- daniel\n+- Daniel Newton\n+- David A.
