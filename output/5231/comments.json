    "body": "There is a use case for bare multisig outputs. If colored coins are sent to bare 2-of-2 multisig output, then it is possible to send stealth transactions (e.g. dividends) to the owner of the asset. The first pubkey is used as the \"receive\" pubkey, and the second pubkey is used as the \"scan\" pubkey. Both privkeys are necessary to retrieve the payment, but only the scan privkey needs to be online to detect the payment. By putting these pubkeys in a multisig output attached the ownership of the colored coin, effectively an anonymous stealth address has been shared.\n\nThis idea is due to @justusranvier.\n",

An example that serves in this context: cryptograffiti.info - a \"real time message embedding service\" that uses P2PKH encoding, basically [because that's what is supported by most clients](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=524877.msg9334447#msg9334447).\n\nAnyway, since almost all Couterparty and Mastercoin transactions imply the use of bare multisig, this chart might provide some insight:\n\n![xcp](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5836089/4985288/ec2640fa-692b-11e4-985f-265bd438fad5.png)\n",

    "body": "@luke-jr If you're going to be consistent, make this pull-req also disable bare OP_CHECKSIG too.\n\n@laanwj Publishing information with OP_RETURN is significantly more expensive and inconvenient than publishing it with CHECKMULTISIG, so of course people use the latter. And yes, ease-of-implementation often triumphs both, as shown by cryptograffiti.info\n\nIn any case, getting rid of bare CHECKMULTISIG will certainly result in more unspendable P2PKH outputs. Heck, I'm writing a colored coin standard right now that'll be able to take advantage of it, with P2PKH/P2SH being a fallback. (CHECKMULTISIG can publish data signed by SIGHASH_SINGLE in ways OP_RETURN can't and never will be able to) We're also looking into using it for stealth payments, again in a generic way so as to be able to flexibly avoid censorship with P2PKH/P2SH available as a fallback. (if the history of OP_RETURN has taught us anything, it's that you should make every effort to make your transactions (optionally) indistinguishable from all others to avoid censorship)\n\nThat said, miners have good reasons to disable CHECKMULTISIG due to the sigops limit; I personally proposed we just get rid of bare CHECKMULTISIG not that long ago for that reason. However slightly smarter transaction selection is a good solution there as well; Eligius already implements this.\n\n@ryanxcharles Actually using CHECKMULTISIG for stealth payments was suggested in my original paper: http://www.mail-archive.com/bitcoin-development@lists.sourceforge.net/msg03613.html \"Bare CHECK(MULTI)SIG output alternative\" although @justusranvier is certainly capable of having reinvented the idea himself.\n",

The exact numbers depend on what you're trying to do, but there's lots of cases where CHECKMULTISIG is cheaper; heck, P2SH/P2PKH is often cheaper.\n\nFor my colored coin protocol with SIGHASH_SINGLE you only get to sign the output at the same index as the input, so in certain cirumstances that come up in atomic trades CHECKMULTISIG is your _only_ secure option.\n",
