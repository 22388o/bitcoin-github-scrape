sipa,2013-08-15T21:47:00Z,Any reason to bother copying the script?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2885#discussion_r5802480,5802480,src/qt/guiutil.cpp
gavinandresen,2013-08-16T02:00:28Z,"@sipa: Not sure I follow. Are you suggesting avoiding a copy by doing something like:\n\n```\nCTxOut txOut;\ntxOut.nValue = amount;\ntxOut.scriptPubKey.SetDestination(dest);\n```\n\nPerformance doesn't matter here, and accessing the CTxOut members directly makes me feel a little dirty...\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2885#discussion_r5806577,5806577,src/qt/guiutil.cpp
gavinandresen,2013-08-16T02:02:02Z,"Oh, or are you suggesting that an empty CScript would work for the isDust() call?  CTxOut::isDust() does use the size of the scriptPubKey.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2885#discussion_r5806591,5806591,src/qt/guiutil.cpp
sipa,2013-08-25T16:04:32Z,Resolved.\n\n@gavinandresen I missed the fact that it uses the serialized size.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2885#discussion_r5968775,5968775,src/qt/guiutil.cpp
