Looks like the mempool info in the debug window has been broken since #17135 was merged, so is part of `0.19.0`. We can backport this into `0.19.1`.\n\nmaster(a7aec7ad97949a82f870c033d8fd8b65d772eacb):\n![master](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/863730/68532255-1cada900-02e9-11ea-93fb-84b9d9c0a4ae.png)\n\npr(40d225",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17427#issuecomment-552118359,552118359,

Would it help to add checks to the return values of `connect` everywhere, to prevent something like this from silently happening again?

laanwj,2019-11-10 09:54:18,"Wait, so there's no way to do static or dynamic checking on this at connect time? That's kind of sucky.\n\nIt would be good to add a developer note on this, that Qt's signal/slot deceptively look like functions, but the arguments are marshalled internally. This restrict the set of types that can be passed that way.\nAnd to be really careful around this.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17427#issuecomment-552179696,552179696,
