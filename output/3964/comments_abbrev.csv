sipa,2014-03-29T16:26:53Z,"It seems we're heading towards two separate classifications (one functionality-based and mostly what the file organization of rpc*.cpp looks like, another dependency-based like here). Do we want to head towards a single one?\n\nThings like the raw transaction API are hard, as together they provide a single functionality, but the dependency/module interactions of the separate RPCs is very different",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3964#issuecomment-39000530,39000530,
laanwj,2014-03-29T16:56:44Z,"Well IMO the only functions that are problematic are the functions that optionally use the wallet, as they make it impossible to do a clean split between the wallet and node functionality. I don't mind what functions end up in what category and if you have a better proposal that's great.\n\nBTW: welcome back @alexwaters!\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3964#issuecomment-39001465,39001465,
sipa,2014-03-29T17:16:31Z,"No, no better proposal. I'm fine with either functionality-based or dependency-based, but we should do it consistently (meaning, that's also how the rpc methods should be organized into files).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3964#issuecomment-39002141,39002141,
laanwj,2014-03-29T17:32:25Z,"Agreed. Well, I'll move the ""raw transactions API"" calls (at least those that are available without wallet) to their own category, I think that's a good idea.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3964#issuecomment-39002550,39002550,
