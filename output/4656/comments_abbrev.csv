Can you change the commit message to the  following format:\n\n```\nChanged LevelDB cursors to use scoped pointers to ensure destruction when going out of scope.\n\nThis corrects a bug where an exception thrown reading from the database causes the cursor to\nbe left open, which causes an assertion error to occur when the database is deleted (around\nline 938 of init.cpp).\n```",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4656#issuecomment-52039888,52039888,
