laanwj,2018-06-04T06:03:16Z,"I like the idea.\nAt some point we might want to split out the *linux specific* instructions too, it doesn't make more sense to have those be an inline part than FreeBSD/OpenBSD.\nOne could argue `build-unix.md` is now ""Linux build instructions but not the UNIX ones"".\nanyhow utACK 1e4eec47beb5d910b99f4c062fa4388337106d14\n\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13372#issuecomment-394243288,394243288,
