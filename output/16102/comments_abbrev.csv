Better to write safe, dumb code to not to have to consider UB.\n\nI'd prefer not to do this.

You can't cast another pointer type to uint32_t pointer and use it, unless you know the actual object is a uint32_t or something compatible with it.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16102#issuecomment-496992166,496992166,
