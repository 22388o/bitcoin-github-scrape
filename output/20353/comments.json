    "body": "TIL. \r\n\r\nConcept ACK.\r\n\r\nSomething could be said for also passing it in the non-debug case. After all, even without explicit debug information enabled, gcc adds some level of basic debug information like symbols, and yes this includes file paths:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ strings -a src/bitcoind | grep /home/$USER|wc -l\r\n1524\r\n```\r\nNot all of these come from debug information though! They may also be from `__FILE__` macro. Is there a flag for that? E.g.:\r\n```\r\n$ objdump --dwarf=info src/bitcoind|grep DW_AT_comp_dir\r\n    <1a>   DW_AT_comp_dir    : (indirect string, offset: 0x9f): /home/\u2026/projects/bitcoin/bitcoin/build/src\r\n    <282c9>   DW_AT_comp_dir    : (indirect string, offset: 0x9f): /home/\u2026/projects/bitcoin/bitcoin/build/src\r\n    <1f2597>   DW_AT_comp_dir    : (indirect string, offset: 0x9f): /home/\u2026/projects/bitcoin/bitcoin/build/src\r\n    <263930>   DW_AT_comp_dir    : (indirect string, offset: 0x9f): /home/\u2026/projects/bitcoin/bitcoin/build/src\r\n    <399a44>   DW_AT_comp_dir    : (indirect string, offset: 0x9f): /home/\u2026/projects/bitcoin/bitcoin/build/src\r\n$ strip src/bitcoind\r\n$ objdump --dwarf=info src/bitcoind|grep DW_AT_comp_dir\r\n$ strings -a src/bitcoind | grep /home/$USER|wc -l\r\n134\r\n```\r\n\r\n>  allow ccache to share objects between worktrees (provided the source and compile options are the same).\r\n\r\nThis sound sensible on first glance but does make me wonder how ccache \"knows\" this? When can it assume objects are portable between build directories. Does it explicitly pay attention to this flag?\r\n\r\nEdit: also mind that if you're doing depends builds (I didn't in my examples above), things become even more complicated because the depends are also compiled from specific directories inside the specific work tree.",

    "body": "> Wouldn't it be easier to set `CCACHE_NOHASHDIR=1`? Sure, the paths in the debug information might be wrong, but does it matter?\r\n\r\nAIUI, if the `__FILE__` macro doesn't match (ie what macro-prefix-map fixes), the preprocessed input to ccache will be different, causing ccache misses. debug-prefix-map fixes the deug info paths, and then triggers ccache to automatically set `CCACHE_NOHASHDIR=1`. So these seems like the \"proper\" way to do it and it's not a big patch, so setting `CCACHE_NOHASHDIR=1` doesn't seem that much easier?",
