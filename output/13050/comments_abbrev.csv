lucash-dev,2018-06-02T17:36:23Z,"Actually in the original code it doesn't since each `CMutableTransaction` is converted to a `CTransaction` just once, and then the hash is cached and copying the `CTransaction` just copies the cached hash. Removing the method that accepts `CTransaction` makes that optimization impossible.\nAnyway, since the method is no longer there, I'll remove this commit and think of some other way of speeding",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13050#discussion_r192565494,192565494,src/test/miner_tests.cpp
MarcoFalke,2018-06-02T18:32:39Z,"Yes, you are right. Feel free to reintroduce the method if you think it was helpful. However, I think if you keep a vector of CTransactionRef as `multisig_txs` instead your patch should work just fine?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13050#discussion_r192566817,192566817,src/test/miner_tests.cpp
