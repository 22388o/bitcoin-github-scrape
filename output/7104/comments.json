How would using only blocknotify's miss notifications, is it not reliable in core? I haven't noticed any reliability issues with blocknotify(from my benchmarking the 3 public ckpool based pools are generally some of the fastest pools to send out updates aside from f2pool and btcchina, which SPV mine of course).\n",

(IMO fast should be the default: to do otherwise is to just set a trap for users, but I don't think it's worth arguing with anyone.)\n",
