glowang,2020-05-25 17:59:11,"This cleanup looks very helpful! I organized the old reachability logic flow in this table (vertically listed are our networks), and it looks like the handling for Teredo is changed. The bolded grid values are now all changed to REACH_DEFAULT in the simplified logic.

ariard,2020-01-21 18:56:57,Isn't the bias to favor IPv4 announcement over IPv6-tunneled lost with the change ? It may make connection relying on 6to4 routers less reliable..,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17944#discussion_r369183147,369183147,src/netaddress.cpp
ariard,2020-01-21 19:14:31,If ourNet is `nullptr` you will now mark its reachability to NET_IPV6 which may be the highest-scored one and announce this one (but can we have null entries in mapLocalHost anyway ?),https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17944#discussion_r369191513,369191513,src/netaddress.cpp

dongcarl,2020-01-23 20:30:09,"Yes, I think we don't want to favor IPv4 over IPv6-tunneled, because it might be the case that the only connection they have is thru IPv6-tunneled.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17944#discussion_r370338770,370338770,src/netaddress.cpp
sipa,2020-01-23 20:44:19,"`this` cannot be `nullptr`, because if it was, you're invoking a member of `nullptr` which is UB.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17944#discussion_r370344620,370344620,src/netaddress.cpp
ariard,2020-02-13 23:55:36,"Okay to be clear we do want to favor connection through IPv6-tunneled, this is behavior change. Maybe code should be better documented but I think commit description is right ""IPv6 peers can reach through IPV6""",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17944#discussion_r379185039,379185039,src/netaddress.cpp
