laanwj,2019-11-25 15:48:43,"I'm not sure about this. It wasn't too long ago that we deprecated ""account"" here. Now we're deprecating ""label"" too. For most purposes (like identifying invoices), assigning one label per address seems to be enough. If someone uses multiple labels per address then yes, a single ""label"" won't do. But I'm not sure it's worth the hassle for all current clients.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17585#issuecomment-558215375,558215375,
jonatack,2019-11-25 16:17:09,"Thanks. It seems to me that the current state of both label and labels being returned might be confusing. Based on the previous two wallet meeting discussions, at the moment I imagine one of these options going forward:\n\n1. deprecate `label`, and add multiple label capability to `labels` (seemed to be the most popular option)\n\n2. keep `label`, and deprecate `labels`\n\n3. keep `label`, a",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17585#issuecomment-558227979,558227979,

jnewbery,2019-11-26 15:11:48,"Concept ACK. Returning the same information in two places in the same RPC call is redundant and confusing (especially when we add support for multiple labels per address, as I believe has always been the plan).\n\n> change labels to tags as a separate feature from the label\n\nPlease no!\n\n> Maybe add 'label' only if there's a single label.\n\nI think it adds unnecessary complexity to cli",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17585#issuecomment-558674393,558674393,
