laanwj,2014-05-21T07:56:25Z,"@Diapolo I think that makes sense. To me there seems to be no pressing reason to upgrade to 5.2.1 for windows, so if we are going to do all the testing and such that is involved with upgrading anyway, let's go for the highest available release.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4205#issuecomment-43724055,43724055,
wtogami,2014-05-21T08:25:26Z,@laanwj We did extensive testing of 5.2.0 and 5.2.1 to the point of not being concerned about it.  Yes there is no pressing need to upgrade Windows except it was easy and it uses the same source as OSX.\n\nDo you want to upgrade OS X to 5.3.0 too?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4205#issuecomment-43727026,43727026,
laanwj,2014-05-21T08:35:25Z,"Yes eventually I want to upgrade OSX to 5.3.0 as well, but not now. Let's test what we have now for a while and not make last-minute changes all the time. \n\nI think targeting Qt 5.3 for 0.10 makes sense.\n\nWindows is a different story. If we're going to upgrade the dep, let's go straight to 5.3.0. In both cases we need to test first, there is no reason to prefer 5.2.1.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4205#issuecomment-43728125,43728125,
