laanwj,2015-03-27T07:57:49Z,Looks good to me. This assert could even be left out as GetAncestor already returns NULL for heights `<0`.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5948#discussion_r27280079,27280079,src/pow.cpp
sipa,2015-03-27T18:14:19Z,"To mimick the exact old code, it would need to be nHeightFirst = std::max(0, pindex->nHeight - (... - 1));. I added the assert to be sure for now that dropping the std::max is safe (which it should be afaict).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5948#discussion_r27318078,27318078,src/pow.cpp
laanwj,2015-04-01T11:21:28Z,"OK, fair enough\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5948#discussion_r27561046,27561046,src/pow.cpp
