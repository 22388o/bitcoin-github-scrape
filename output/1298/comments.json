    "body": "For commit \"4843b55 Make CNetAddr::GetHash() return an unsigned val.\", I verified that there was only one user of CNetAddr::GetHash() by changing the return value to 'void' and seeing where the compilation broke.\n\nIn the single user of that function, I think the changes are relatively straightforward and the hash calculations more likely to be correct using uint64 than int64.\n\nFor commit \"fe78c9a Don't overflow signed ints in CBigNum::setint64()\", I wrote a small program that tested creating a few CBigNum vars, with positive and negative integers, to make sure the results were the ones expected.\n\nThese 2 bugs were detected using a tool that automatically detects some kinds of undefined behavior at run-time. After fixing them, no more errors were reported.\n\nFurthermore, I let bitcoind run with that tool, along with another one which detects memory corruption problems (even more kinds of memory corruption than valgrind is able to detect), while confirming the latest ~150 blocks of the main net. It successfully confirmed them without any apparent problems.\n",

    "body": "I added test cases for CBigNum::setint64(). It was a bit more complex than I thought because gcc (with -O2) was inlining the function and, due to the values being constants, optimizing it to the point that -ftrapv was not detecting the signed subtraction overflow when the function was given an INT64_MIN argument.\n\nAfter the test case was added, it was aborting in one of the test cases, as expected, due to the mentioned bug.\n\nThe commit \"5849bd4 Fix signed subtraction overflow in CBigNum::setint64()\" then fixes the bug.\n\nNote that this bug is also present in the mainline bitcoin code and will cause bitcoin to crash when a CBigNum var is initialized with an INT64_MIN value and the code was compiled with -ftrapv.\n",
