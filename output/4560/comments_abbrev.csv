petertodd,2014-07-21T20:19:33Z,"Stuff like the OP_SIZE makes me wonder if we should just add something that checks the exact stack returned by script evaluation. As this is consensus critical stuff it may even be worthwhile to just have a step-by-step stack trace that is compared exactly.\n\nBut yeah, good tests! ACK\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4560#issuecomment-49659639,49659639,
sipa,2014-07-21T20:27:36Z,#3901 sounds really useful for implementing such tracing.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4560#issuecomment-49660616,49660616,
petertodd,2014-07-21T20:40:11Z,"@sipa Yes, but we could also do it with a lot less risk with a simple callback that if set took the state of execution as arguments. That'd keep the consensus-critical changes to an absolute minimum. #3901 would be safer to implement after we had testcases using the simpler callback mechanism too.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4560#issuecomment-49662282,49662282,
laanwj,2014-07-22T07:53:52Z,@petertodd Good idea\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4560#issuecomment-49708775,49708775,
OttoAllmendinger,2014-07-23T10:27:46Z,Checking the the stack is also be possible by using `EvalScript` instead `VerifyScript`. In fact I found some of the bugs by comparing the stack after running `EvalScript`. \n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4560#issuecomment-49857045,49857045,
