    "body": "Why do you keep insisting on having all block files in a single continuous chunk? I implemented pre-allocating specifically to address the excessive fragmentation the previous mechanism seemed to cause on some platform, but it's unreasonable to want every file to only be one chunk.\n\nI'll consider this if you can show benchmark results that this helps. PS: block and undo files are almost never accessed in the new code, contrary to 0.7 which needed them all the time for validation.\n\nA patch to just implement AllocateFileRange specifically for Windows is no problem at all.\n",

    "body": "First of all, dealing with fragmentation is a reasonable request. It's not Windows-specific by the way - if you don't allocate a file in one go, it will lead to fragmentation on just about every system and every filesystem. Pre-allocation is the solution to this, and it's already implemented. If Windows has a better way for pre-allocating than writing zeroes, sure provide an optimized version for that specific function in util.cpp - that's what it's there for.\n\nBut please:\n- Don't put platform-specific stuff in the block management code because you fear 100 fragments will hurt you. If it does, we need to increase the pre-allocation size perhaps.\n- Don't allocate entire files without knowing you'll need it. That's just wasted space. For the block files this is limited (as they grow anyway, so you're on average only 64 MiB above needed), but for undo files it's simply not known how large they'll grow (they contain the undo data corresponding to the block with the same number). Making them any specific size will either be a permanent waste, or not enough.\n",
