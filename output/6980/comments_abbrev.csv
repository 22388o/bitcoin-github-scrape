fanquake,2015-11-11T07:22:25Z,"Added another commit with @theuni's miniupnpc fix. @theuni If we're bumping depends, are there any others we should look at for 0.12.0? The 4.0.x release of zeromq is now retired, with 4.1.3 being the latest. Should we bring our package (4.0.4) up to the latest release of the retired branch (4.0.7)? Or would we leave it and move to 4.1.x in future?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6980#issuecomment-155690900,155690900,
laanwj,2015-11-11T09:45:30Z,"@fanquake For libraries like ZMQ, which are still in quick iteration development, static linking is unfortunately kind of suboptimal. I'd say bump it, otherwise by the time 0.12 final is out we're speaking a dead language :)\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6980#issuecomment-155717768,155717768,
