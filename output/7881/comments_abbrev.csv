MarcoFalke,2016-04-15T12:42:51Z,You can't add a new line here and keep the pre-whitespace. This will mess with the formatting\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7881#discussion_r59867864,59867864,doc/release-process.md

laanwj,2016-04-15T13:26:45Z,Well if there should be a popd it should at least be balanced by a pushd. Out of the blue it is very strange.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7881#discussion_r59873235,59873235,doc/release-process.md
