theuni,2014-11-05T23:34:25Z,"@randy-waterhouse Does this actually fix #5195? I'd think that AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE would end up testing for gcc.\n\nAlso, many of those prog checks can just be dropped rather than moved, since libtool checks for them. I was going to PR that change at some point, but this seems like a good time. Looking quickly, I think we can drop:\n\nAC_PROG_CC\nAC_PROG_CPP\nAC_PROG_CXXCPP\nAC_PROG_INSTALL\nAC_PROG_",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5214#issuecomment-61902273,61902273,
