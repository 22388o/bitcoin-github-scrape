luke-jr,2017-03-09T22:20:39Z,"Concept ACK.\n\nIdea: Is there any reason a user might want to load or dump but not both?\n\nMaybe it should be a debug option... dunno.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9966#issuecomment-285502222,285502222,
laanwj,2017-03-10T06:59:00Z,"utACK apart from the nit, seems straightforward enough.\n\nWe should indeed consider the debug/non-debug status of this option. Is it worth adding translation strings for this, or is it just for technical debugging/development purposes? Not entirely decided about this.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9966#issuecomment-285593490,285593490,
paveljanik,2017-03-10T07:03:50Z,"@luke-jr there is. I had the same idea while debugging #9810. I wanted to load the original `mempool.dat`, but not rewrite it at the exit. I solved it by copying `mempool.dat` back before the next start. And as the workaround is so simple, please let's not complicate the code with yet another option.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9966#issuecomment-285594154,285594154,
