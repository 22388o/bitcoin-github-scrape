brandondahler,2014-05-30T03:16:32Z,You might as well merge this whole set of ifs into a single one:\n\n```\nif ((!pszDest && (IsLocal(addrConnect) ||\n      FindNode((CNetAddr)addrConnect) || CNode::IsBanned(addrConnect) ||\n      FindNode(addrConnect.ToStringIPPort().c_str()))) ||\n    (pszDest && FindNode(pszDest))) \n{\n    return false;\n}\n```\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4227#discussion_r13215286,13215286,src/net.cpp
