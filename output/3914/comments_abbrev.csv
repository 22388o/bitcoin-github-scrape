laanwj,2014-03-20T13:00:07Z,"OK, whereas the 64-bit ones seem to work fine, the 32-bit static executables produced this way are absolutely broken.

theuni,2014-03-20T17:45:48Z,I'm still very hesitant on this approach. I'd be much more comfortable with picking a minimum required glibc version and wrapping symbols for newer versions.\n\n@laanwj What's the minimum glibc you've got on any of those systems? I'll see if I can work up a POC for the sake of discussion.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3914#issuecomment-38198622,38198622,
