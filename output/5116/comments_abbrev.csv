theuni,2014-10-22T02:01:38Z,"IIRC ssl2 was kept due to an odd quirk with qt4. But I agree this is the correct, setting that aside.\n\nWhen I get around to finalizing #4727 we may see the ssl2 problem again, and we can decide how to proceed from there.\n\nAssuming there's no reason to avoid updating, ACK.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5116#issuecomment-60026745,60026745,
DomT4,2014-10-22T02:13:34Z,"The qt libraries are such a pain. I cross my fingers for a better solution than qt one day. But yes, It'd certainly be good to kill off ssl2 if possible, given it has been the equivalent of shouting your encrypted data out of the window at random passersby for the last decade or so, heh. I use a no-ssl2 OpenSSL on OS X, so feel free to shout if I can be of any use testing old errors and such.\n\nL",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5116#issuecomment-60027434,60027434,
