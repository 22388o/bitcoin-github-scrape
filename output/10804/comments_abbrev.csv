jnewbery,2017-07-13T21:44:40Z,"My immediate reaction to this is the same as https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10757#issuecomment-313714215 and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9733#issuecomment-291981292. I'm not a fan of these statistical RPCs, which seem to me to be very interesting, but really only provide niche functionality. My issue is that they add maintenance burden for features that are only likely to be u",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10804#issuecomment-315210781,315210781,
promag,2017-07-14T22:18:11Z,"I generally agree with you, this is easily done out but the problem is when the UTXO set is very large:\n - listunspent can take minutes to complete;\n - the result is a huge array;\n - no pagination support\n - locks held too much time.\n\nThe goal with this RPC, is to create a flexible UTXO counting to solve the above problems in one-shot.\n\nTypically this is useful for online wallets t",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10804#issuecomment-315481252,315481252,

To my mind, this project should try to minimize functionality to what's essential for end users.\n\n@jnewbery IMO there is space for a basic statistical feature like this in core, which is by far one of the easiest around in code.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10804#issuecomment-315481771,315481771,
laanwj,2017-07-17T12:46:22Z,"I don't share @jnewbery's general resent against statistical calls. Sometimes the information to compute the statistics is available only server-side.\n\nIn this case, however, all the information is available in the `listunspent` result. So this can just as well be computed in an external script. Building it into bitcoind is an unnecessary burden.\n\n> For me, they're better served by a fork ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10804#issuecomment-315745348,315745348,

promag,2017-07-17T14:49:21Z,Closing since the general opinion is to compute client side. I guess the above bottlenecks should be tackled instead.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10804#issuecomment-315778162,315778162,
