jonasschnelli,2017-11-29T23:59:54Z,"Tested a bit.\nThe multiselection works well.\n\nI got confused by the selection count indicator label.\nIt's confusing because you have the first button ""(un)select all"" where the new ""(1) selected"" has a different context for ""selected"".\n\nMaybe remove the label (just add the multiselection possibility) or use a different help text for the new label... though I don't think it's necessary ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11750#issuecomment-348037573,348037573,

laanwj,2018-02-12T10:09:46Z,"> It's confusing because you have the first button ""(un)select all"" where the new ""(1) selected"" has a different context for ""selected"".\n\nI have the same opinion here; the coin selection is already inherently multi-select, as multiple outputs can be checked. So adding another layer of multi-selection on top is confusing. It's no longer clear whether selection refers to ""toggled checkbox"" or ""s",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11750#issuecomment-364878408,364878408,
