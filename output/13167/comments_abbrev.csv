achow101,2018-05-05T04:31:32Z,I think you will need to also record `curr_selection_size` since copying `curr_selection` may also copy outputs that were selected in previous iterations that are not actually part of the current selection (i.e. selected previously but are at indexes past `curr_selection_size`).,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13167#discussion_r186252133,186252133,src/wallet/coinselection.cpp
achow101,2018-05-05T04:32:53Z,This should go up to a tracked `best_selection_size`. Otherwise we may accidentally include outputs which are not part of the best selection as they are at locations past the size of the actual best selection.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13167#discussion_r186252166,186252166,src/wallet/coinselection.cpp
achow101,2018-05-05T04:33:43Z,"As an extra belt-and-suspenders check, walking backwards should reset each selection choice to the default state of false.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13167#discussion_r186252179,186252179,src/wallet/coinselection.cpp
martinus,2018-05-05T05:06:32Z,"I think this is not necessary. If I understand it correctly, what's right from `curr_selection_size` will always be 0. The only place where the size goes back is in line 114-117, the loop stops when it finds `true` then sets it to `false`. So there is no way that any value right from `curr_selection_size` will ever be true",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13167#discussion_r186252801,186252801,src/wallet/coinselection.cpp
