laanwj,2013-05-09T09:11:53Z,"That's a good idea, to keep this updated and merge this just before the 0.8.2 release. It prevents superfluous updates to the translation files (ie all those pesky +122/-231 and ""untranslated"" messages) in git and still allows having the latest translations in the release.\n\nSo just in case: before tagging/packaging 0.8.2, please merge this pull first @gavinandresen \n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2630#issuecomment-17655815,17655815,
