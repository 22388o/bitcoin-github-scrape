sipa,2012-05-09T02:14:51Z,"In some places, the bucket identifier -1 outside the normal valid range is used to denote an illegal value , so they are ints. Another possibility would be making them unsigned, and use the value (unsigned int)-1 to denote illegal values.\n\nThe first option required less code change, and it doesn't really matter; there are only 64 and 256 buckets.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1230#issuecomment-5591340,5591340,

gmaxwell,2012-05-09T11:06:09Z,"Considering that we don't even work on big endian, the implementation definedness of (unsigned int)-1  shouldn't bother me that much.  But it does.  In all other contexts casting a negative value to an unsigned type, which may not be so obviously unsigned if its a typedef,  is almost certainly a bug.  I'd much rather we were doing something else... but not reason to delay this pull.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1230#issuecomment-5597443,5597443,
