morcos,2017-01-15T22:36:30Z,"@sipa how does that mesh with @marcofalke's observation of same binaries?   Different gcc?\n\nI'd prefer if we decide to do this that we add some documentation that it's just for performance reasons and that if people change the code so there are non obvious requirements for a derived class that they should document that.

theuni,2017-01-16T15:34:56Z,"@morcos Agreed, and I think that a comment at the location of the ""final"" in that case would suffice.

Do not change to 'override'.\n};\n\nclass Fickle final // deriving from Fickle would be unsafe.\n{\n};\n```\nThere's no way for me to override foo() or Fickle without removing those warnings.

sipa,2017-01-16T16:00:56Z,"@morcos I only tested with isolated example, where class B derives from class A, and an overridden method is called on a variable of type B that comes from another module. As the compiler can't know that B isn't a reference to an object of a class C that derives from B, it has to emit the vtable lookup. But in many cases, analysis can show that this B variable points to an object of type B exactly",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9545#issuecomment-272900167,272900167,
