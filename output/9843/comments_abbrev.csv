jnewbery,2017-02-23T23:03:47Z,"Yes it is. There are lines of code in the test which aren't testing anything, and the test code is catching an error without asserting the error type or error text.\n\nA future commit could break GBT in some other way and the broad exception handling would mask that.\n\nThere's also a print() two lines above which says: ""Verify non-segwit miners get a valid GBT response after the fork"".

jnewbery,2017-02-25T16:25:59Z,"Thanks @MarcoFalke. I'm not a fan of leaving unexecuted lines in the test code just in case the product code is changed in the future. Re-adding a few asserts in this test case is negligible effort compared to actually adding the functionality to bitcoin core (which would require significant changes to the mining code). \n\nAnd if writing 7 assert lines is really too much effort, git history is ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9843#discussion_r103082190,103082190,qa/rpc-tests/segwit.py
