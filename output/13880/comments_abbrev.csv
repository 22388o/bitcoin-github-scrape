promag,2018-08-07T22:35:27Z,Add try/catch here instead? Otherwise should fix indentation above.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13880#discussion_r208406440,208406440,src/qt/bitcoin.cpp
promag,2018-08-07T22:36:18Z,Could log something? Same below.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13880#discussion_r208406605,208406605,src/qt/bitcoin.cpp
MarcoFalke,2018-08-08T00:32:45Z,"Any suggestions? Note that I'd rather not write to the debug.log, since that might be the cause of the exception.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13880#discussion_r208425469,208425469,src/qt/bitcoin.cpp
laanwj,2018-08-22T15:34:25Z,I tend to agree that blanket-ignoring exceptions is very bad. Even printing to stderr would be better to at least have a potential chance of someone diagnosing of seeing the error!,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13880#discussion_r212002370,212002370,src/qt/bitcoin.cpp
MarcoFalke,2018-08-22T15:43:11Z,"The gui is not always started from the command line, so that would be missed often as well. But I guess I could add it.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13880#discussion_r212005720,212005720,src/qt/bitcoin.cpp
ryanofsky,2018-08-31T18:01:33Z,"I don't think it is right to call `appShutdown()` here because it should be covered by `return quit();` below. `quit` should cause the first application loop to quit, which should trigger `requestShutdown()`:\n\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/59ecacfc84af13e5a1608e7d970315d07dcb0269/src/qt/bitcoin.cpp#L718-L720\n\nwhich should trigger `requestedShutdown()`:\n\nhttps://github.com/bit",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13880#discussion_r214432767,214432767,src/qt/bitcoin.cpp
ryanofsky,2018-08-31T18:09:09Z,Could call PrintExceptionContinue(nullptr) in these empty catches. `boost::current_exception_diagnostic_information()` could also be used to add more detail.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13880#discussion_r214434710,214434710,src/qt/bitcoin.cpp
