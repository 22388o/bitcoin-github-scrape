jgarzik,2014-02-13T14:30:45Z,"meh.  gettransaction and getrawtransaction also work on wallet transactions. Naming is confusing, and perhaps implies redundancy:\n\nJust make getrawtransaction find these TXs, also.  No apparent need for a new RPC.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3663#issuecomment-34982843,34982843,
sipa,2014-02-13T14:32:34Z,"gettransaction is a wallet RPC, but doesn't return the raw transaction.\n\ngetrawtransaction is not guaranteed to work on wallet transactions. It works on mempool transactions, and on blockchain transactions if txindex is enabled.\n\nMy suggestion would be to add the raw transaction as an extra field to the gettransaction output?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3663#issuecomment-34982998,34982998,

laanwj,2014-02-13T15:41:27Z,"@jgarzik It would be a bad idea to make getrawtransaction query the wallet. IMO, we don't want to confuse wallet and other node functionality even further. Having seperate methods makes it easier to modularize.\nAlso it would become a method like getinfo and validatetx that does a different thing based on enablewallet/disablewallet.\n\nAdding rawtransaction data to gettransaction is fine with me.\",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3663#issuecomment-34990654,34990654,
