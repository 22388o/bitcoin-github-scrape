theStack,2020-10-16 13:23:44,"Hm, I had a few test runs that finished in ~6 seconds (i.e. introduction of a new transaction would terminate the longpoll immediately, not only in +1minute), but can't reproduce it anymore. Changed the message back to original.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20159#discussion_r506414234,506414234,test/functional/mining_getblocktemplate_longpoll.py
theStack,2020-10-16 13:23:47,"Nice catch, thanks. Added a commit that removes the helpers `random_transaction` as well as `make_change` and `gather_inputs`. The latter two were only used by `random_transaction`.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20159#discussion_r506414296,506414296,test/functional/mining_getblocktemplate_longpoll.py
theStack,2020-10-16 13:23:53,"The intention was to ensure that both nodes have matured utxos, not only the one where we generate the blocks. However, only generating on one node and simply adding a `self.sync_blocks()` is the better solution. Fixed.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20159#discussion_r506414458,506414458,test/functional/mining_getblocktemplate_longpoll.py
MarcoFalke,2020-10-16 15:01:50,"why does the fee need to be random?\n\nedit: I guess doesn't matter. The `random` import is needed either way",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20159#discussion_r506519720,506519720,test/functional/mining_getblocktemplate_longpoll.py
theStack,2020-10-17 06:34:32,My idea was to keep the test as close as possible to the original and only tackle the parts involving the wallet. Agree though that a fixed fee would work as well.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20159#discussion_r506831201,506831201,test/functional/mining_getblocktemplate_longpoll.py
