gavinandresen,2012-12-01T00:02:09Z,ACK if you add a comment something like:\n// height will be < checkpoint only when reading an old blockchain via -loadblock or -reindex\n// (skip re-org'ed transactions in those cases)\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2056#discussion_r2284322,2284322,src/main.cpp
sipa,2012-12-01T00:03:42Z,"@gavinandresen During normal IBD it will be < checkpoint too. As a follow-up, we should probably disable accepting things to the mempool during IBD altogether...\n\nEDIT: right, but you shouldn't be receiving side chains when doing normal network IBD. Nothing prevents a peer from sending one nonetheless though.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2056#discussion_r2284331,2284331,src/main.cpp
