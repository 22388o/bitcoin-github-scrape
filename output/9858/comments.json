The better reporting may be useful, as miners may use GBT under circumstances that aren't covered by any tests during rcs, but it seems we have a pretty good track record the last few releases.\r\n\r\nI think there are two reasonable approaches:\r\n* Run a background thread that occasionally runs TBV on the CNB results. It doesn't have to test everything, and it can do so with a delay. Unfortunately, TBV's locking of cs_main may interfere with other CNB calls.\r\n* Make the TBV call optional like in #9859, and leave it on in unit and RPC tests, but off by default in production.",

    "body": "@sipa I think just making it optional is probably best, doing block proposals within the stratum server would be good since it can be done completely outside of the critical path, although I'm not sure how easy it would be to add support for that in the various stratum servers themselves. I like cory's faux-mining for testing a little more at least for non-production testing since it can be done without modification of the stratum server.",

    "body": "I don't think making it optional is useful.  It will almost never be run where it needs to be run. And more options mean more mostly untested code that will catch fire later when someone does happen to use it.\r\n\r\n> Run a background thread that occasionally runs TBV on the CNB results. It doesn't have to test everything, and it can do so with a delay. Unfortunately, TBV's locking of cs_main may interfere with other CNB calls.\r\n\r\nWe should be able to get the locking into a state where it can return a cached template without taking cs_main.  In which case, running the test immediately after returning a result will run it during a time when its mostly only returning a cached result. Moreover the test could be made interruptible, in case a new block arrives-- this is also important for BIP23 block proposal testing.\r\n\r\nI do disagree that mining an invalid block is equal to or better than a delay:  A shutdown lets you fall over to another daemon, a shutdown tells you something is broken so you fix it rather than days of fake mining, and a shutdown also prevents you from making blocks that cause false confirmations for SPV clients propagated around broken nodes that broadcast without validating.  -- but the whole question should be moot, since we should be able to perform this check without adding any meaningful delay.\r\n",
