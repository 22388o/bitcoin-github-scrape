gits7r,2016-11-29T14:05:54Z,"ACK.\n\nI confirm explicitly asking for the key type is supported for as far back as ADD_ONION is. Until RSA1024 keys (v2 HS) are permanently rejected in the Tor network, this patch should work. It's useless to ask for `BEST` key type when there is a p2p protocol 'address' limitation (I don't think the limit should go away, just increased just enough to keep up with current demands).",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9234#issuecomment-263578429,263578429,
