laanwj,2017-03-29T07:41:40Z,"Great!\n\n> Removes GetRand() and replaces it with a single deterministic FastRandomContext instance.\n\nI'd prefer to create a deterministic `FastRandomContext` per test case, and pass that in where necessary instead of using a global helper function. Otherwise determinism depends on the order in which test cases are run, which might change if e.g. new ones are added.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10099#issuecomment-290009453,290009453,
