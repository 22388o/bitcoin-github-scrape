kallewoof,2017-07-19T09:15:03Z,"@jonasschnelli For `fundrawtransaction`, you will no longer see the resulting fee, which is a pity, but if you don't need to know it, it's fine. For `signrawtransaction`, you will not see if it was only partially signed, which may trip you in certain cases, but I don't think it would end up in lost money or be dangerous (you just have a transaction that the network will reject).",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10877#issuecomment-316323873,316323873,
jonasschnelli,2017-07-19T09:44:06Z,"@kallewoof your right about `fundrawtransaction` (I mixed it up with `bumpfee`). But what about `signrawtransaction` Errors like `TxInErrorToJSON(txin, vErrors, ""Input not found or already spent"");` or the possible script sig errors?\n\nI think its probably acceptable to suppress those errors, but maybe we should mention that in the help description.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10877#issuecomment-316331448,316331448,

kallewoof,2017-07-19T23:27:35Z,"> Does this sounds more like a bash mode for cli than verbose option?\n\nI chose verbose because if you look at e.g. `createrawtransaction` it responds with the hex only (the same style), whereas the ones here will respond with a JSON object with extra information.

I think chaining commands together without intermediate error checking like this is definitely dangerous and poor practice, but there are probably legitimate use-cases for testing, etc.\n\nThinking out loud: verbosity is a very common option for RPCs.
