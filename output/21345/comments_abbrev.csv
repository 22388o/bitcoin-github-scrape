brunoerg,2021-03-03 00:40:29,Is there a reason to replace `self.log.info` with `print`?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21345#discussion_r586017652,586017652,test/functional/p2p_leak.py
mzumsande,2021-03-03 00:50:54,Yes - I think it would have caused a crash before because we are inside `P2PInterface` which doesn't have a `log` -  only `BitcoinTestFramework` does.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21345#discussion_r586021482,586021482,test/functional/p2p_leak.py
