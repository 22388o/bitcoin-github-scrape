TheBlueMatt,2017-06-22T20:38:34Z,Shouldnt the docs (here and above) be in the .h and not the .cpp?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10412#discussion_r123616077,123616077,src/wallet/wallet.cpp
TheBlueMatt,2017-06-22T20:39:16Z,Maybe move TIMESTAMP_WINDOW into an implicit thing that this function applies to the provided timestamp (and move its definition out of wallet.h)?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10412#discussion_r123616216,123616216,src/wallet/wallet.cpp
ryanofsky,2017-06-22T20:54:49Z,I put the docs here to be consistent with `CWallet::ScanForWalletTransactions` below. But I'd be happy to move all the wallet method documentation to one place or the other in a followup commit or PR if there's a correct place for it.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10412#discussion_r123619751,123619751,src/wallet/wallet.cpp
ryanofsky,2017-06-22T21:24:46Z,"Done in deaf48b046e573f6774d19e74b58918ed777cb14. I think it's probably a good change, though it doesn't allow hiding the TIMESTAMP_WINDOW constant in wallet, because it's still used by the `pruneblockchain` implementation and also in `importmulti` error messages.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10412#discussion_r123626045,123626045,src/wallet/wallet.cpp
