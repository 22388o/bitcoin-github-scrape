ryanofsky,2017-06-15T16:55:47Z,"#10597, which is a similar whitespace-only change, was closed recently because of a developer guide admonition to ""not submit patches solely to modify the style of existing code.""\n\nIs this policy worth keeping, or maybe modifying to only apply to global changes like #10597 and not local changes like this?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10592#issuecomment-308801986,308801986,
fanquake,2017-06-16T00:38:55Z,"@ryanofsky I think changing it to mention global vs local would be ok. Global whitespace/indentation/etc changes only serve to break pull requests and disrupt other work. Small, contained changes like this, should be fine.

jnewbery,2017-06-16T13:48:51Z,"@ryanofsky - I think the developer guide is referring to cases when a new style is adopted by the project or becomes the norm. In those cases, contributors shouldn't open PRs to make existing code conform to the new style (as this leads to constant rebase hell).\n\nIn this case, indenting class members has always been the accepted style, and this PR just fixes the indentation that was broken by ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10592#issuecomment-309030787,309030787,
sipa,2017-06-16T21:45:40Z,Agree with @jnewbery; the indentation here is just broken and needs fixing. That's not the same as updating from one style to another.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10592#issuecomment-309141510,309141510,
jtimon,2017-06-17T17:41:22Z,fast review ACK. I didn't do it at the same time for #9494 to remain easier to review.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10592#issuecomment-309229466,309229466,
