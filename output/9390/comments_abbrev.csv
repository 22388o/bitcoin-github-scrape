theuni,2016-12-21T04:13:26Z,"@MarcoFalke Yea, I don't think there's any way around configuring twice for that. There is a built-in that uses the cache to save some time, though.\n\nJust change the:\n```\nmake $MAKEJOBS check VERBOSE=1\n```\nto\n```\nmake $MAKEJOBS distcheck VERBOSE=1\n```\nI think that should actually work these days.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9390#discussion_r93371912,93371912,.travis.yml
