    "body": "This patch serves no purpose other than providing a \"hack\" around a flaw in the Bitcoin core. Previously OpenSSL did not look for invalid DER encoded data with possible trailing garbage but in the latest version it does. The actual problem is that Bitcoin accepts invalid DER encoded signatures and this is completely unrelated to OpenSSL. Now you are taking the invalid-DER encoded data and DER encoding it before calling ECDSA_verify. Because of this the same operation will be performed twice for every signature verification wasting CPU cycles. You MUST always DER encode your signature before passing it off to OpenSSL and this is nothing new. So this being \"low\" on OpenSSL's list is correct from my expert opinion as it is only performing validation and Bitcoin is passing invalid data.\n\nECDSA_verify:\n\n```\nint ECDSA_verify(int type, const unsigned char *dgst, int dgst_len,\n    const unsigned char *sigbuf, int sig_len, EC_KEY *eckey)\n{\nECDSA_SIG *s;\nconst unsigned char *p = sigbuf;\nunsigned char *der = NULL;\nint derlen = -1;\nint ret=-1;\n\ns = ECDSA_SIG_new();\nif (s == NULL) return(ret);\nif (d2i_ECDSA_SIG(&s, &p, sig_len) == NULL) goto err;\n/* Ensure signature uses DER and doesn't have trailing garbage */\nderlen = i2d_ECDSA_SIG(s, &der);\nif (derlen != sig_len || memcmp(sigbuf, der, derlen))\n    goto err;\nret=ECDSA_do_verify(dgst, dgst_len, s, eckey);\nerr:\nif (derlen > 0)\n    {\n    OPENSSL_cleanse(der, derlen);\n    OPENSSL_free(der);\n    }\nECDSA_SIG_free(s);\nreturn(ret);\n}\n```\n",

For example, encoding R and S with leading zeros.  This is substantive, non-backwards compatible, arguably somewhat under-disclosed (seems that you were also unaware of the actual change, in that you refer to it as \"trailing garbage\"), breaking API change from the existing and widely known behavior.  Signatures come from the outside world (Bitcoin Core itself has never generated anything but strictly minimal encodings), and the decoding functions are OpenSSL internal.  As a result previously accepted encodings (and not just 'trailing garbage') will be rejected.  \n\nWhile this may not matter for most applications, a switch to be more conservative is not something that can be done in an uncoordinated way for a consensus system without resulting in an opening for funds loss. This is just the state of things, and not a question of \"flaw\" or blame. My description (http://sourceforge.net/p/bitcoin/mailman/message/33221963/) of the matter is just a statement of the facts about it.\n",

If OpenSSL does not want to guarantee consensus-compatible behaviour for invalid signatures, that's fine for them, but it breaks Bitcoin. The plan has been to close this issue in Bitcoin for a long time, and it would have been nice if OpenSSL took care breaking compatibility everywhere in a mere bugfix release. Note that a hardfork (or even a softfork) to fix this is not something we can do overnight, as we do not have any kind of authoritative control the protocol: making a change requires the consensus of every Bitcoin user, and coordination of that is a time consuming process that generally takes months.\n\nNote that with Bitcoin (and I imagine most scenarios you'd be verifying a signature!), signatures are from an external source, so you can't say \"just encode them right\"... any signature-checking code really should assume the signature is untrusted data and possibly an attempt to perform a remote exploit.\n\nAlso note that Bitcoin Core has itself generated only DER-compatible signatures for a long time.\n",

    "body": "> never did perform DER encoding \n\nI'm afraid your statements don't really make a lot of sense. Signatures emitted by Bitcoin core are correctly DER encoded.  OpenSSL provides a verify function which takes a string of bytes with an already encoded signature from the outside world. This is its documented behavior, and it's how OpenSSL itself uses it.  I would be surprised if you were able to find a _single_ prior user of that function which pre-parsed to verify or re-encoded the inputs before handing them to OpenSSL.\n\nAs previously mentioned, we have had work in progress previously to reduce the systems dependence on OpenSSL's behavior here. But such changes must be coordinated. \n",

    "body": "The problem with Bitcoin core is that secp256k1_ecdsa_sign_compact does NOT DER encode the output nor is it encoded into DER format at any point thereafter. This is why it became broken with the improved integrity checking that the latest OpenSSL brought. So \"compact signatures\" have always operated in a broken manner because of this flaw in the Bitcoin core. This bug does not have any relations to \"network consensus\" like Gavin has stated. All cryptographic signatures that leave the wire or a stored to disk MUST always be encoded in some manner using DER or otherwise to maintain compatibility and platform neutrality. It should be fixed properly to ensure the security of the system IMHO as this is a flaw in the sign and verify feature of Bitcoin core.\n",

I'd generally be happy to educate you (or anyone else), but your continued antagonism is tiring.  In this case; You're complaining about not using DER encoding for data which cannot be DER encoded and is never passed to a function that expects DER encoding.\n\n> So please explain why signature verification is failing?\n\nBecause while Bitcoin core generates and has always generated strictly encoded valid DER for transactions, third party implementations such as Armory, Blockchain.info, and MTGOX (among many others) previously generated signatures with excessive padding (e.g. additional leading zeros inside R and S instead of the shortest possible encoding). From time to time old (or new) instances of this continue to crop up. In the past the establish software, based on OpenSSL, accepted these signatures since OpenSSL provided no method to distinguish these signatures from a non-excessively padded signature and it happily decoded them. The updated OpenSSL decodes and reencodes the signatures and the result is a shorter encoding, which it rejects.\n\nBecause Bitcoin is a consensus system all participants must agree on if a particular string of bytes is valid signature or not, or the blockchain can diverge as a result of their disagreement.\n\n> can't happen\n\nThis simple concept of what can and cannot happen based on what Bitcoin Core would send is too narrow for working in a public network, especially under adversarial conditions. Any sequence of bits that can be sent, probably will be sent, especially if they trigger interesting behavior.\n",

    "body": "Your claims there continue to be confused and incorrect. Notice above that I pointed out \"In the past the establish software\"-- subsequently Bitcoin Core implemented default local node policy to not relay incorrectly encoded signatures (by testing the transactions with it's own strict DER decoder, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/script/interpreter.cpp#L89) as the first step in a process to eliminate them.  This widely announced change delayed transactions for software which continued to produce them.\n\nDo not mistake your own ignorance about the technology or the history for any dishonesty on my part.
