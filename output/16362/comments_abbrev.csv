In the description, I'd say something like, ""This PR adds a bilingual_str class and a strprintf overload that allows bitcoin code to easily send dual translated and non-translated messages to the GUI and the logging framework. This PR is only a refactoring, and does not change behavior.""\n\nDone.\n\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16362#issuecomment-514610487,514610487,
