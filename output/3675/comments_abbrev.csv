jgarzik,2014-02-15T05:02:26Z,"This is completely insufficient.  You must update dependencies... conditionally.  And there are several edge cases even so.

laanwj,2014-02-15T07:40:14Z,"@djpnewton You'd have to update vfSpent for the appropriate outputs of parent transactions, but only if there isn't another transaction spending that output. \n\nAlso if you zap a transaction that has dependents, you need to zap those as well. And zapping those transactions, in turn, may trigger vfSpent updates in other transactions.\n\nIf you want to do this at runtime there is also other cached ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3675#issuecomment-35149652,35149652,
djpnewton,2014-02-15T08:17:52Z,@jgarzik  @laanwj Thanks for the comments.\n\nWill a rescan update the vfSpent values if one were to zap a single transaction?\n\nIf so would it be feasible to zap a single transaction (and its dependents) at startup and rescan? \n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3675#issuecomment-35150117,35150117,
laanwj,2014-02-15T09:51:04Z,IIRC a rescan will not touch existing transactions at all. It just adds transactions that were missing.\n(Though it may update vfSpent when new transactions appear that spend old outputs. It will never do the opposite and helpfully clear vfSpent. MarkSpent is a one-way street)\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3675#issuecomment-35151852,35151852,
djpnewton,2014-02-16T12:24:22Z,OK I have a (probably still naive) implementation that kills child transactions and updates parent tx spent outputs. If the function is performed at runtime the some of the results do not show up until a restart.. some cache needs to be cleared.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3675#issuecomment-35195461,35195461,

laanwj,2014-02-17T09:43:54Z,Even without vfSpent update it would be useful to be able to remove non-confirming transactions from others (like 1Enjoy 1Sochi spam). Though -zapwallettxes could be used for that too.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3675#issuecomment-35241718,35241718,
