And zapping those transactions, in turn, may trigger vfSpent updates in other transactions.\n\nIf you want to do this at runtime there is also other cached state that will need to be updated.\n\nAlso if you do this low-level you want to keep an inactive copy of the zapped transaction around for forensic purposes.\n\nAll in all ... it's very complex. The proposal is to get rid of vfSpent which would make this (among other things) easier. But that is quite involved (and error prone) in itself. That's why we went with the sledgehammer approach for now.\n",
