On the contrary Qt GUI entry looks good to me ;-)\n\nI think there is no need to mention explicitly the Git/whatever tree type etc. Maintainers should work on GitHub. Patches should be PRed not published to mailing list (if you want to \"publish them\" first, lets mail the link to the branch) etc. The workflow is GitHub centric... If there is anything specific about particular maintained area, lets describe it, but...\n\nOr do want e.g. Jonas to create its own maintained Qt GUI tree and then him to PR the changes (like @theuni 's trivial tree)?\n",
