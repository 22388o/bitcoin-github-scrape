theuni,2017-08-03T22:51:55Z,"Err.. I'd rather not, as this really needs to be a member of the message processor instead. We'll likely start moving in that direction after #10756 goes in.\n\n@TheBlueMatt agreed?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10915#issuecomment-320110946,320110946,

promag,2017-07-23T23:39:07Z,Why the different initial value?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10915#discussion_r128933055,128933055,src/net.h

benma,2017-07-24T05:38:03Z,"Mostly because of this: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10596#discussion_r128319151\n\nPersonally, I also slightly prefer to put the correct default here, but it does not matter much as it gets overwritten anyway.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10915#discussion_r128952533,128952533,src/net.h
benma,2017-07-24T05:38:48Z,Is it needed? It gets set during `Start()` and isn't used before. Or is it a matter of good form?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10915#discussion_r128952588,128952588,src/net.h
promag,2017-07-24T23:36:57Z,Some future refactor can call `GetRelayTxes` (or other) before `Start()` and there is no way to know/prevent that.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10915#discussion_r129181273,129181273,src/net.h
benma,2017-07-25T07:07:03Z,Good point. Done.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10915#discussion_r129226826,129226826,src/net.h
