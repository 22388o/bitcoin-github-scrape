pasky,2011-06-27T15:45:54Z,"Thanks for the feedback! I'm not sure about your suggestion of providing a raw transaction. I aim at something that is suitable for automated use, but at the same time users can still realistically use manually. It is not clear what exactly do you mean by ""here's a transaction"" - would you like something like, say:\n\n```\n{ ""in"": [ { ""prev_out"": { ""hash"": ""..."", ""n"": ""..."" } } ], ""out"": [ { ""valu",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/354#issuecomment-1448212,1448212,
pasky,2011-06-27T19:14:24Z,"By the way, thinking things through more, now I think that sendtxfee/paytxfee should not be imposed on these transactions (our goal is still creating transaction only based on pubkeys stored in our wallet, but no extra client automagic), but creating unrelayable transactions still should not be allowed. Does that make sense? In line with that, AIUI I should check against nMinFee but not nPayFee?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/354#issuecomment-1449728,1449728,
