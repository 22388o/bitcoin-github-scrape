If you compile this PR on Ubuntu 18.04 with the system packages (Qt 5.9.5) and Clang 10, you're still going to see 100s of warnings, because nothing has changed there since #18738. i.e:\n```bash\n/usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu/qt5/QtWidgets/qstyleoption.h:620:106: note: in implicit copy assignment ope",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22240#issuecomment-862073852,862073852,
