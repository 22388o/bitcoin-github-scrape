Given it was patched in 5.13, testing `Fedora 34 + Qt 5.15.2 ` wasn't going to yield anything. \r\n\r\nAs for `Ubuntu Focal + Qt 5.12.8:`, my assumption was the same as yours (either different backport or Ubuntu patch), but I guess I should have just tested this myself first, as this still spews warnings...?\r\n\r\nI guess NACK from me for now.
