Empact,2019-05-27 19:52:08,"-0 IMO better to rely on the definition in `IsCoinBase`. I think the line you cite may be for coherence with https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/76e2cded477bc483ec610212bdadf21fe35292d4/src/validation.cpp#L1973\n\n/cc @sipa #4835",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16103#issuecomment-496294450,496294450,
promag,2019-05-28 08:59:13,@Empact that commit also replaces `IsCoinBase()` with `i > 0`. I just think it could be consistent.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16103#issuecomment-496428733,496428733,
practicalswift,2019-05-29 07:16:27,"@promag I think this change makes the code less clear for new contributors who might not be aware of the fact that the first transaction must be a coinbase transaction. If the rationale is performance: the call to `IsCoinBase()` should be essentially free, no? :-)",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16103#issuecomment-496815631,496815631,
mzumsande,2019-05-29 12:47:29,"For me as a new contributor, the fact that there is currently a mix (lines 2048 and 2051 use `i`) is more confusing. If we don't want to rely on `i>0` in spite of having called `CheckBlock()` at the beginning of `ConnectBlock()`, why not use `IsCoinBase()` consistently (maybe call only once per tx and store in local bool for performance).
