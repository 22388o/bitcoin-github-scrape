kallewoof,2018-11-29T04:29:11Z,That's a good point. Is that the only case `ContextualCheckBlock` is called with `pindexPrev == nullptr`? (When block is the genesis block),https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14834#issuecomment-442702526,442702526,

kallewoof,2018-11-29T04:53:08Z,"Yeah, that pretty much proves it. It could change in the future, though, so I think the change is still warranted.

kallewoof,2018-11-29T05:01:59Z,"@luke-jr I changed the approach and am now asserting that `pindexPrev` is non-null for the case where the lock time flags have `LOCKTIME_MEDIAN_TIME_PAST`.
