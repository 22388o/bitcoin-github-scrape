sipa,2017-01-09T16:49:18Z,Can you do this as a unique_lock field inside CCheckQueueControl (so we don't need to rely on an explicit destructor to be correct)?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9495#discussion_r95195260,95195260,src/checkqueue.h
JeremyRubin,2017-01-09T16:56:54Z,"Unfortunately this is the ""easiest"" way to take care of this given that we want debug order & the CMutex class has no default constructor/moveable semantics. Certainly can be fixed to RAII easily later.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9495#discussion_r95196950,95196950,src/checkqueue.h
sipa,2017-01-09T16:59:44Z,Understood. Let's improve that in a separate PR later.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9495#discussion_r95197559,95197559,src/checkqueue.h

kallewoof,2017-02-28T21:48:36Z,"Nit: Is there some coding standard for mutexes which makes you capitalize this ivar? If not, maybe `controlMutex` would be more consistent.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9495#discussion_r103559631,103559631,src/checkqueue.h
