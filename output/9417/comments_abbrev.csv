rebroad,2016-12-24T04:40:34Z,"@sipa Thanks - I was just about to look into coding something similar so you have saved me the job. In the similar way that GetBoolArg() works, I wondered if perhaps we could have a boolean check for whether various debug are set, or perhaps even a scenario where we can say log this if debug=tx OR debug=mempool is set since I have some debug lines from mempool and tx functions merged, perhaps some",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9417#issuecomment-269068838,269068838,

Not all side effects are good. :)\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9417#issuecomment-269136972,269136972,

It's unfortunate that this needs a macro solution.\n\n~~Does macros with variable arguments work for all (recent) C++ compilers?~~ Apparently we already rely on that.\n\nutACK 407cdd6",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9417#issuecomment-270604268,270604268,
sipa,2017-01-05T13:29:09Z,"I looked this up. I find mentions that C++11 mandates support for vararg\nmacros, however, it's not even listed in GCC's C++11 support pages. Perhaps\nit's been supported for so long that they didn't bother listing it? Then I\nnoticed we're already using vararg templates in the codebase, so I stopped\nworrying.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9417#issuecomment-270643980,270643980,
