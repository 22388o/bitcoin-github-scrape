If so, then we should probably not use `assert(false)` in the two places here (and instead explicitly print an error message and exit using other means).",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14138#issuecomment-418150288,418150288,
gmaxwell,2018-09-03T16:03:28Z,"@domob1812 We explicitly do not support that, but at the same time the code should not contain strange bugs when run that way.  This is not an argument against assert(false)-- that should be used to protect invariants where if violated potentially things would happen elsewhere.
