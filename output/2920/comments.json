    "body": "Thanks for taking the time to try out something here, but I'm going to have to decline this optimization.  The timing resistant equal is used to avoid leaking information about the length of RPC passwords in timing, your optimization would restore that information leak.\n\nIf you're interested in working on improving performance, I suggest doing some profiling on Bitcoin and working on things that show up high in the profile.\n",
