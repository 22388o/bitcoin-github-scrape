JeremyRubin,2017-03-30T17:50:11Z,"Any reason to not return a const ref?\n\nAlso, ArgsAt is a bit of an odd name, perhaps ArgsFor or something (but maybe not worth the effort to redo this)",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10119#discussion_r108992551,108992551,src/util.cpp
JeremyRubin,2017-03-30T17:55:25Z,Should this push_back or replace?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10119#discussion_r108993944,108993944,src/util.cpp
JeremyRubin,2017-03-30T17:56:17Z,Is the PR too big if you get rid of these?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10119#discussion_r108994163,108994163,src/util.cpp
JeremyRubin,2017-03-30T17:57:19Z,why not use multimap?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10119#discussion_r108994438,108994438,src/util.h
jtimon,2017-04-04T13:20:50Z,"I believe push_back, but it's a good point, I am not sure now.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10119#discussion_r109659230,109659230,src/util.cpp
jtimon,2017-04-04T13:30:52Z,"I was just using the same that was used before. We can move to multimap, what would be the gain?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10119#discussion_r109661779,109661779,src/util.h
JeremyRubin,2017-04-04T14:10:46Z,"No real gain, just slightly simpler (because multi_map is intended to be used I think exactly in this type of case).",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10119#discussion_r109672784,109672784,src/util.h
jtimon,2017-04-04T15:17:19Z,"The less disruptive to remove are removed in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10119 I'm happy to squash that in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9494\nOthers are more disruptive to remove, but I'm working on doing it for SoftSetBoolArg and IsArgSet in https://github.com/jtimon/bitcoin/compare/0.14-args-wrappers...jtimon:0.14-args-isargset-wrapper but I'm not sure everybody will like",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10119#discussion_r109692600,109692600,src/util.cpp
jtimon,2017-04-05T20:07:05Z,See https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9494#discussion_r95578281 for some reason all your reviews are appearing in #10119 instead of #9494 . Can you make the comments there for other reviewers to get them? Remember after #9494 this PR (#10119) is a single commit (that could be squashed to #9494 or not),https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10119#discussion_r110014965,110014965,src/util.cpp
jtimon,2017-04-05T20:09:36Z,"I thought it was more for when you wanted the elements on the vector to be ordered in certain way or something. Leaving the same structure seems easier to review, but once encapsulated it is easy to make further improvements to ArgsManager's internal implementation.

JeremyRubin,2017-04-05T20:26:06Z,oh -- I didn't understand 'includes' to mean builds on the PR. gotcha,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10119#discussion_r110019152,110019152,src/util.cpp
