    "body": "> Yes, this seems like a very bad idea to structure it this way - exposing lots and lots of bitcoin core's internal interfaces externally is very poor library design as those interfaces are nearly guaranteed to change.\n\nYes, I mentioned the burden of keeping what is normally an internal API stable in my PR. However, I see this as a problem for the platform binding maintainers, not the bitcoin core devs. I would rather change my bitcoind.js project with every update than hamstring bitcoin's improvements by forcing it to follow the traditional model of a library with a stable API.\n\nI originally started writing bitcoind.js based off a fork of bitcoin v0.9.0 (it was just what I was more familiar with at the time, and it happened to be code from roughly 8 months ago). After rebasing onto the latest HEAD, it took me maybe an afternoon to update the code for the new internal functions, classes, types, etc: That's **8 month's** worth of API changes updated in an afternoon. I don't think it will be that difficult for library authors to keep up, short of a major, major refactor.\n\nI also want to make it clear, that bitcoind.js, for example, is a **full** bitcoin node. _It simply **is** bitcoind_, just running inside a node.js process. It creates a wallet, finds peers, and downloads the blockchain as soon as it starts. bitcoind.js is sort of a proof-of-concept right now, but I hope to make it production-ready soon. bitcoind.js can access any block or transaction, listen for block and transaction events as they come in, verify blocks and transactions, send bitcoins with automatically constructed transactions based on any available unspent outputs, or build a transaction manually and broadcast it. It has enough features to be useful.\n\nUsers of this or other similar libraries essentially can run bitcoind with their own programmatic enhancements. This is a huge step up from simply making RPC calls to a bitcoind server.\n\nAlso, the coders using bitcoind.js only see the **external documented JS API**. They don't have to deal with the nitty gritty bitcoin core API. As long as whatever library (for whatever platform, be it python, ruby, etc) stays up to date with bitcoin's internal interface, the only people who have to worry about it are the library maintainers, like myself. It isn't as difficult as it may seem at first.\n\nI may be wrong, but I don't see this as much of a change. It's all hidden behind a compile-time flag. Very little has to change in the codebase. You can simply forget about it if you want to. Don't bother worrying about maintaining a stable API. Leave that to the platform library maintainers, or maybe there could be one well-maintained global wrapper for it as mentioned. Who knows?\n\nI heard the `-export-dynamic`/`-rdynamic` argument mentioned here and there (which maybe only works with gcc? I suppose it doesn't work with clang, now the compiler of choice for Apple machines), which builds a binary which is both linkable/dlopen'able and executable. I think that's a great idea. Anything to make this simpler is good. Like I said, the build could be improved. That's why I posted this.\n\nPersonally, I can live with OSX users not being able to use this because I'm a total linux fiend, however, the ability for programmers to test on OSX is also probably important. All that being said, if this option does end up being used, `-fvisibility` would still most likely have to be set to default on all object files (correct me if I'm wrong). This is mentioned in my post and apparent in the diff.\n\nI've spent the last several months working on two different alternative bitcoin implementations, yet I've decided I want to eventually write my own main wallet based on bitcoind.js or something like it.\n\nMy first attempt at a bitcoin wallet was using JSON RPC calls to bitcoind, and it was **extremely** limited. After two pull requests here trying to improve the RPC calls to make them more reasonable, I was shot down twice. So, I guess I took to more drastic measures: I wanted something better, and something that is not an alternative implementation.\n\nAnyway, that's all I really have to say. Thanks for the consideration at the very least. I was hoping there would be a few more proponents, but whatever the decision, I trust it leads bitcoin in the right direction. I figure most here are likely to be in a better position to determine that than me.\n",

I would love to write a C++ wrapper and abstract _that_ into a library and simply maintain that as frequently as bitcoin itself changes. Libraries for any other language or platform could use that.\n\nbitcoind.js was just sort of a proof-of-concept for now. A well-maintained C++ wrapper library could be possible in the future with the existence of libbitcoind.so.\n",

The drawback is that whatever you're developing needs to be developed in lock-step with bitcoin core's internals, but for some uses that can be acceptable.\n\nFor those uses the only feasible way right now is to manually patch bitcoind to yield a library, or re-implement everything (as bitcoin-pythonlib did). I went with using bitcoin-pythonlib in my case. But I'm not opposed to doing this (IF it can be done without impact to other library-zation efforts such as the consensus library).\n\nEdit: `-rdynamic` sounds like a nice solution though.

    "body": "Thanks for your sympathy, @laanwj. I really wish this wasn't seemingly dismissed so quickly. I should have figured it's been tried before. I think it can be useful anyway and isn't too intrusive to the current build even if it appears to be a step in the wrong direction at first glance. I do like the way you did it and I'm glad you learned something about libtool (meanwhile I'm still trying to figure all of it out). :)\n\nAs of now, I've rewritten the `Makefile.daemon.include` to make it much simpler, with no hardcoded list of object files, so bitcoin core devs likely don't have to bother with modifying it much in the future. They can simply ignore it. Furthermore, leave the worrying of the API to the devs using this and wrapping it. There's no need to create a documented stable API.\n\nAlso, as a minuscule aside, you'll notice I've also renamed bitcoind_main.cpp to bitcoin-main.cpp to match source file naming convention.\n\n(NOTE: It still doesn't build on OSX: OSX seems to require some esoteric magic in order to work. If someone could give insight into that it would be fantastic. I don't have an OSX installation of my own, so I can't really test too often).\n",
