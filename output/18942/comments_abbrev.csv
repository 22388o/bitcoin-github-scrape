I was hoping 0.22.0 will be the big and wholesale build cleanup:\n\n* No gitian, but guix :rocket:\n* No boost, but C++17 :rocket:\n* No historic glibc, but modern glibc :rocket:\n\n\nObviously that comes with cutting support for most historic versions of gcc and clang, as well as operating systems.
