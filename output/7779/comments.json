    "body": "@sipa Thank you for bringing that up, that's the concern I expected.\nIn the same way, when/if we create tx validation flags for say, tx, header, block...\nIt will feel like a layer violation that the block validation flags are in the same enum as the tx validation flags, won't it?\nSo the real question is, how many different enums do we want for consensus validation flags?\n\nTo me, the answer is one. The layer we should be most concerned about is the consensus layer.\nWould you feel better if all the flags were moved from script/interpreter to consensus/flags.h or something similar? Although it seems the right thing to do, it doesn't feel like useful disruption, the priority is moving consensus code out of the consensus module to the consensus module. Moving things that are already in the consensus module already doesn't seem very helpful at this point.\n\nAnyway, 1 or not, I need to know what the number will be. With BIP68/BIP112/BIP113 I originally suggested that we at least called them tx validation flags instead of locktime flags, but I got an answer along the lines \"this kind of detailed can be bike-shed later\". I agreed and patiently waited for many months. Well, I'm trying to get an answer again now.\n\nIt won't be hard (only painful and ugly) to separate the parameter `flags` in libconsensus' VerifyTx() ( see https://github.com/jtimon/bitcoin/commit/c90f08f97a0965868dd1ff502e79f22f3ad7e787 ) into 3 different parameters: scriptFlags, lockTimeFlags and txFlags.\n\nGetConsensusFlags() (see https://github.com/jtimon/bitcoin/commit/d3cf04f547d8d2e6eefc38858dd931a4985955f0 ) can also be easily separated in 3 or more functions (it just becomes the opposite of elegance and stops being practical).\n\nIf the first commit gets merged as it is, great. If it doesn't, but I get an answer to my question, \"how many types of consensus flags we need if 1 is not enough?\", also great.\nI will personally argue in favor of at few as possible.\nSo if 1 (this PR ) is nacked, I will argue in favor of scriptFlags and nonScriptConsensusFlags as the next best thing (ie 2).\n",

    "body": "@jtimon That's an interesting discussion, and it is related to the question of how the code should be layered a) by (script,tx,block,blockchain) or b) by (primitives,serialization,validation/consensus,signing), as all combinations of these are possible. If we primarily organize by b, then it makes sense to have only one set of consensus flags. But what if we want to extend the usage of scripts beyond transactions? (for example, signing messages with script). It would be very much be a layer violation if the message signing/validation logic needs to be aware of block-level consensus flags like BIP34. \n",

Then we can have a translator function or something that gives you the corresponding script flags for some given consensus flags. Is that your proposed solution?\nSeems unnecessarily complicated, but perhaps only because I may still not be understanding the concern, so let's make sure I got that right.\n\nLet's imagine we are using the interpreter for signed messages already. Let's also imagine that we move all the existing flags (both the script and the locktime ones) to consensus/flags, without unifying them or anything. Your concern would be that we have LOCKTIME_VERIFY_SEQUENCE and LOCKTIME_MEDIAN_TIME_PAST in there because they are not used by interpreter.o?\nIs that really a problem?\nThere would be no functionality in consensus/flags.h, only flags and documentation. Why is it so bad that interpreter doesn't use all the flags in consensus/flags.h ?\n",
