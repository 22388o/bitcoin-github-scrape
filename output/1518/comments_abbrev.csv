laanwj,2012-06-30T09:34:51Z,"There's another thing that might eventually be useful in the QR code dialog: showing the constructed bitcoin: URL (above the image?), so it can be copy/pasted into mails and such.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1518#issuecomment-6684087,6684087,
Diapolo,2012-06-30T10:33:43Z,"That is rather easy to achieve, are you ok with the code and changes thus far? I can integrate your suggestion here or create another pull on top ... just as you like.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1518#issuecomment-6684357,6684357,
laanwj,2012-06-30T11:11:20Z,"It was just a random idea, doesn't have to be in this pull.\n\nAm I right that QRCodeDialog::setModel is never called? Did you test it? Looks like addressBookPage needs a setOptionsModel to pass on to QRCodeDialog.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1518#issuecomment-6684542,6684542,
Diapolo,2012-06-30T11:31:14Z,"I'm working on your idea right now :). setModel() is unused, because I didn't know, how to get easy access to the options model :-/. Any hint / idea?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1518#issuecomment-6684656,6684656,
Diapolo,2012-06-30T13:29:02Z,"Updated:\n- add read-only QPlainTextEdit field to output generated URI\n\nI chose an TextEdit to be able to use word-wrap and see the whole URI, drawback is, that I was unable to implement a working EventFilter to select all text without messing up other behaviour of the TextEdit field. A copy URI button could be added before the ""Save As..."" one though.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1518#issuecomment-6685247,6685247,
laanwj,2012-07-01T14:22:54Z,"Nice! \n\nI'd add a setOptionsModel method (called from BitcoinGUI::setClientModel) to AddressBookPage, which stores the options model. Then when creating the QRCodeDialog you can pass it.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1518#issuecomment-6693832,6693832,
Diapolo,2012-07-01T15:14:12Z,"@laanwj Thanks mate :). I'll update to integrate your suggestion and do this as seperate commit, so you can see easily what was changed. After your final ACK I can merge that commit, so we only have one if you want.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1518#issuecomment-6694184,6694184,
Diapolo,2012-07-01T16:34:17Z,Updated:\n- add OptionsModel in AddressBookPage and use it in on_showQRCode_clicked() to pass it to QRCodeDialog\n\nI verified this to work.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1518#issuecomment-6694843,6694843,
