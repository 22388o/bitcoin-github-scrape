jonasschnelli,2016-08-25T06:45:30Z,@rebroad: check https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0111.mediawiki.\n\nNot all nodes want to provide the BLOOM FILTER service. SPV bloom filtering will consume lots of CPU and disk usage. The produced and consumed data will very likely be worthless for the p2p health after generating/transmitting (where a BLOCK or TX structure will be relay further by other full nodes to other full nod,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7708#issuecomment-242295330,242295330,
sipa,2016-08-25T06:51:21Z,And not disconnecting them when they request a bloom filter which we don't\nprovide would make them unnecessarily stall. By disconnecting you give them\nan opportunity to find a better peer.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7708#issuecomment-242296285,242296285,
