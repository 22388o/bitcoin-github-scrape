jameshilliard,2016-02-20T02:18:23Z,The workaround I've used is:\n\n```\nbrew link openssl --force\n```\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7560#issuecomment-186487676,186487676,
jonasschnelli,2016-02-20T08:07:38Z,"The force linking is also a good idea, though, I think if we detect brews OpenSSL pkgconf, we should also allow to detect the headers in brews OpenSSL path. \n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7560#issuecomment-186541163,186541163,
jameshilliard,2016-02-20T08:22:24Z,I think [this](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/share/doc/homebrew/How-to-build-software-outside-Homebrew-with-Homebrew-keg-only-dependencies.md) is how you would do that properly.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7560#issuecomment-186542149,186542149,
jonasschnelli,2016-02-20T08:49:28Z,@jameshilliard I think this PR would do it exactly as recommended in you link.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7560#issuecomment-186544448,186544448,
jameshilliard,2016-02-20T08:53:04Z,Doesn't it need $(brew --prefix) in the include path for keg only openssl?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7560#issuecomment-186544739,186544739,
jonasschnelli,2016-02-20T09:06:18Z,Check: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7560/files#diff-67e997bcfdac55191033d57a16d1408aL281\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7560#issuecomment-186545707,186545707,
laanwj,2016-02-29T09:08:22Z,@theuni can you take a look here?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7560#issuecomment-190112633,190112633,
theuni,2016-03-01T06:35:44Z,"@jonasschnelli hmm, appending PKG_CONFIG_PATH should be enough to pick up on the openssl headers (that's what it's there for).  In the header check, we first set `CFLAGS=""$CFLAGS $SSL_CFLAGS $CRYPTO_CFLAGS""`, which should add whatever pkg-config finds.\n\nSo your change shouldn't be necessary, seems to me something else is broken.\n\nCould you please paste the relevant failure from config.log?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7560#issuecomment-190571857,190571857,
jonasschnelli,2016-03-01T08:00:41Z,Cannot reproduce the issue anymore. It was probably a local-only thing.\nThanks @theuni!\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7560#issuecomment-190603071,190603071,
