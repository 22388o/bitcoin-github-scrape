MarcoFalke,2019-12-29 10:59:41,Tests should use the `assert_*` helper methods instead of a plain assert to aid debugging in case of failure. E.g. `assert_greater_than`,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17794#issuecomment-569494611,569494611,
jimmysong,2020-01-01 15:50:20,"Would doing the same in feature_block.py, address.py, test_framework.py, util.py, wallet_create_tx.py also make sense? They all have some form of `assert <=` which should also be converted if this is the best practice.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17794#issuecomment-570063046,570063046,
jonatack,2020-01-02 18:31:18,"I'm -0.1 on this change. Perhaps if done as a scripted diff that converts the rest of the test suite like @jimmysong rightly mentions, and even then... refactoring existing test assertions costs the project in limited review time, the possibility of introducing regressions, code churn, and obscuring the git blame / git history (for little gain).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17794#issuecomment-570298144,570298144,
achow101,2020-06-12 20:02:11,Also -0 on this. This seems like something that can just be added the next time a `assert >=` is needed in a test.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17794#issuecomment-643460135,643460135,
MarcoFalke,2020-06-12 20:45:51,"Concept ACK. I think it makes sense to have more verbose error messages. This will help debug issues in failed test runs, where the datadir and debug log has been discarded (e.g. travis)",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17794#issuecomment-643476232,643476232,
fanquake,2021-04-08 06:25:02,What is the status of this change? @MarcoFalke you've concept ACK'd. Is there anything more that needs to be done prior to merge? Do the changes need to be more extensive across our test code? Do we need to update some developer docs etc?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17794#issuecomment-815484839,815484839,
