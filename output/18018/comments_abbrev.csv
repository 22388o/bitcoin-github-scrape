fanquake,2020-01-29 11:03:22,"> These kind of order-dependent stale state errors are kind of nasty, and hard to keep track of. Would it make sense to do this reset as part of the test fixture?\n\nYes, I think so. Tests really shouldn't be sharing any sort of global, mutable state, and them passing should not be dependent on the order in which they are run.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18018#issuecomment-579704758,579704758,
MarcoFalke,2020-01-29 14:42:59,This can be fixed by parsing the command line arguments when the TestingSetup is constructed. Calling `AppInitParameterInteraction` will reset them to the default.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18018#issuecomment-579786714,579786714,

MarcoFalke,2020-01-29 18:47:21,"This is a nice one-line fix in the same fashion as we used to handle globals in unit tests in the past: If a unit-test changes them, they are reset by the same test to the value they were before.\n\nAs a follow-up it could make sense to normalize argument parsing and have the TestingSetup re-parse the arguments to set them to the default. Though, I suspect that that would be a larger change.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18018#issuecomment-579902625,579902625,
