I assume they are just not bothering to set a custom limit.\n\nThe problem is that if we are currently using 400kb, and the number of transactions continue to increase at the current rate, it won't be long before that number increases, and it's going to take a while for miners to get up to date so I feel it's better to increase it a bit now, while we wait for consesus around the 'hard' block size limit increase, or other viable solutions to scalability to come along.\n\nAlso worth noting that the data Luke has used removes 'Microtransactions' and transaction which Luke has classified as 'Inefficient/data use of the blockchain', but nevertheless are still occurring. \n",

    "body": "@luke-jr Are you saying that if we are \"barely reaching 400k blocks today\" (on average), then 400k soft limit is optimal?\n\nThis argument is just asinine...\n\nImagine a phone company finds that on average 100 phone lines are used at the same time during peak hours, but only 5 are used at the same time at night. Computing the average for the whole day, they get 20, so in order to optimize costs, they reduce their switching hardware capacity to 20 parallel phone calls. Does it make sense?\n\nObviously, no. If people will find that they can't use phone during the day, they will believe that quality of this company's service is extremely poor and phone is pretty much useless.\n\nThere is in fact  a branch of operations research called queueing theory which studies things like that, and can be used, among other things, to find optimal capacity. But who needs these complexities when you use **average**, the pinnacle of mathematical thought (according to Luke-jr)?\n",

Won't you leave it for an operator which has enough capacity to handle all phone calls during peak hours with no surcharges?\n\nNow imagine that before doing a call, you need to choose a tariff: business, premium, standard, economy. If there is an overload, economy users' calls will be dropped, then standard users and so on. Business tariff has highest priority. But also costs more, even when network is below its capacity.

    "body": "@davout Yeah, sorry, I was only replying to Jeff's comment, not yours. Though that said bigger picture discussion is better off on the mailing list, and/or forums like reddit.\n\nRe: default blocksize, what should actually happen is it should be removed and replaced by a calculation that takes orphan risk into account. Basically, every transaction you add increases the chance of orphaning your block by some amount due to the larger size. If you know that marginal increase you can then keep a running tally of total block reward and stop adding transactions when marginal reward > marginal cost. As it turns out that constant can be calculated from the orphan rate and your own hash rate relatively easily, and orphan rate can be observed. (IIRC the constant basically has bytes/second as its units) There is the nuance that much of the hashing power has special peering setups that push orphan rate to near zero; your blocks don't necessarily get to participate in those peering setups. \n\nOf course, actually writing that patch and setting the default marginal orphan rate constant appropriately would be a great backdoor way of increasing the default max blocksize to 1MB. :)\n",

    "body": "@JustinDrake I did it by going through the list of pools and checking the size of blocks they were producing, counting any pool that made blocks >750KB as definitely not using the default. Secondly, I used my knowledge of pool policy from various sources - like talking to pool owners - to add pools that had chosen to reduce the limit, or make the limit meaningless. (e.g. Eligius actively changes their limits in response to many factors)\n\nThe graph you're looking at is drawn such that a relatively small number of pools using a 750KB shows up as a clear line - rather misleading.\n",

The more so a policy default that only applies to miners, not other full nodes. \n\nWhich is the entire reason that I closed the issue. \n\nAgain, lobby miners to increase the above option value. They can, and they are aware of it. There is no reason at all for this to be decision for Bitcoin Core development.  Everyone has their own responsibility in this decentralized network. Don't try to play it through me, I'm just here for bugs and issues related to the implementation.\n\n(and yes, the current default value was grandfathered in, not as a \"policy\" but as a working default value - maybe @luke-jr is right and these defaults should be removed completely, _forcing_ miners to set them. I've always pushed back against that because it makes upgrading for miners harder, and they are already a conservative bunch)\n",
