Sjors,2021-04-02 18:39:56,"I'm not tremendously excited by this approach of overloading `bumpfee`. But it also seems wrong to use `psbtbumpfee` here for the simple case of a single signer that has all the required keys. I could add yet another RPC method `signerbumpfee`?\n\ncc @achow101 @instagibbs ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21576#issuecomment-812659510,812659510,

Sjors,2021-05-31 15:07:50,"For now these comments are correct. In a multisig setup `bumpfee` will throw ` ""Transaction incomplete. Try psbtbumpfee instead.""` (which in turn won't call the external signer).
