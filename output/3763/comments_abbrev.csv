kanzure,2014-02-27T20:05:23Z,So future changes to these files should be submitted to https://github.com/jgarzik/python-bitcoinrpc first or should python-bitcoinrpc.git be deprecated? And maybe this answer could be included in this README either way.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3763#issuecomment-36285042,36285042,
gavinandresen,2014-02-27T20:49:42Z,@kanzure : python-bitcoinrpc changes should be submitted upstream. I updated the README to make that clear.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3763#issuecomment-36289616,36289616,

petertodd,2014-02-27T22:47:17Z,"FWIW python-bitcoinrpc is considered depreciated by jgarzik; it's now incorporated into python-bitcoinlib, which in turn I've been maintaining: https://github.com/petertodd/python-bitcoinlib\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3763#issuecomment-36301503,36301503,
laanwj,2014-02-28T07:58:24Z,"@petertodd It seems to be that we don't want to include the complete python-bitcoinlib. And it's useful to have the tests self-contained instead of asking the user to install dependencies.The only part we need is the RPC proxy to be able to run tests against bitcoind.\n\nThe other option would be to use a Python wrapper around bitcoin-cli in the test harness, but using the RPC directly seems someh",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3763#issuecomment-36328944,36328944,
petertodd,2014-02-28T18:32:25Z,"@laanwj Yeah, it is a order of magnitude more code and will just keep getting bigger. It's what I do with the dust-b-gone repo though - computers are fast and disks big.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3763#issuecomment-36380119,36380119,
