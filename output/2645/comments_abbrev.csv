jgarzik,2013-06-17T13:08:39Z,"So, it's one of those things :)\n\nIt is a good change, and something my python code should probably emulate to boost python speed.  Technical review yields an ACK.\n\nThe main issues are external:  the area of code being touched is a critical component, and this totally rewrites the component [in a positive way], in a slightly more complex way.  That increases the risk profile.  It correspondingl",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2645#issuecomment-19543415,19543415,
petertodd,2013-06-17T19:21:14Z,"Are the code paths independent enough to run them side-by-side on live data? If so we could do exactly that and have bitcoind quit if they disagree. You'd then want to enable this behavior probabilistically so that at any time a small subset of the network is using the new code, say 1/8th. If a bug or exploit starts getting used hopefully bug reports will start flowing in. The reason why you would",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2645#issuecomment-19568087,19568087,
sipa,2013-06-17T19:24:51Z,"@petertodd If it takes that much effort to convince you this is safe, I'd rather just close this pull request.

laanwj,2013-06-17T19:27:10Z,I agree with this change as it makes what happens more explicit. On the other hand it seems risky as it's very hard to verify or prove that the hashed parts stay exactly the same.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2645#issuecomment-19568454,19568454,
petertodd,2013-06-17T19:56:29Z,@sipa I haven't reviewed the code carefully enough to be convinced one way or the other technically - I just wanted to float the idea given it's an option we haven't used yet.\n\nThat said inline signature serialization helps most with the largest transactions; I don't think we know much yet about what the advantages and disadvantages of allowing really large and complex transactions actually are ,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2645#issuecomment-19570323,19570323,
