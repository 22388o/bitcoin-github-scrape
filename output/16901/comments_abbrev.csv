ch4ot1c,2019-09-18 08:35:56,"`===` is an h1 or `#`, and `---` is an h2 or `##`. MD003 is false, so they can be mixed within a file. Since  unordered lists are now consistent within a file, and it looks weird, I could see a good argument for changing that.\n\nThe code blocks can be made both ways, correct.\n\nThanks for the feedback on Travis.

laanwj,2019-09-18 12:22:07,"> Thanks. However I'm also ~0 on this. While I agree in general that it'd nice to have consistent formatting etc throughout the documentation. Going as far as someone needing to known the markdown ""rules"" before they can actually write any docs doesn't seem ideal.\n\nCompletely agree with this. Tend toward NACK.

jonasschnelli,2019-09-18 12:46:37,I also tend to NACK on this for the stated reasons. Mild code style enforcement is acceptable. Building a too strict environment leads to wasted resources though.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16901#issuecomment-532668010,532668010,

fanquake,2019-09-18 04:33:16,I wouldn't be in favor of having to turn `markdownlint` warnings on and off throughout files. It's going to just look messy non-rendered (not everyone reads our documentation on GitHub). It also seems to go against the whole point of choosing and enforcing some sort of formatting.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16901#discussion_r325478581,325478581,doc/developer-notes.md
