MarcoFalke,2016-10-08T19:43:42Z,"Closing, as this seems too controversial. Also, I don't like that files are moved for this reason as this breaks all hotlinks referring to the docs on `master`.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8901#issuecomment-252444315,252444315,
MitchellCash,2016-10-08T21:24:17Z,"@MarcoFalke no problem. I would say this change will need to happen at some point though, as the use of 'macOS' will start to become more common when referring to Apple's operating system and the term 'OS X' will fall out of favour and to some people maybe even unrecognisable.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8901#issuecomment-252449205,252449205,
laanwj,2016-10-11T13:52:14Z,Agreed with closing this. We don't have to mirror every one of Apple's marketing moves immediately.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8901#issuecomment-252922813,252922813,
