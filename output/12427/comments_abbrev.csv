Sjors,2018-02-15T13:06:03Z,"Manually tested `signrawtransaction` with explicit private key arguments on regtest, with P2SH-P2WSH. Works on this branch, and throws `Unable to sign input, invalid stack size` on master.\n\nAlso tested with a native P2WSH multisig for good measure. This already worked on master.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12427#issuecomment-365921651,365921651,
