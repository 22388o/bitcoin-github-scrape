Thus, I wonder why we prefer to potentially introduce a bug in bitcoind to avoid a fix in the GUI code.\n\nIf #17135 brings down the frequency of the ""not responding"" pop ups to a 0.18.0 level, it should be preferred, imo",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17182#issuecomment-543727928,543727928,

I think we should just skip this for 0.19.0, leave fixing this properly for 0.19.1.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17182#issuecomment-545391099,545391099,
