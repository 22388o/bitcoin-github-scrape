jnewbery,2017-11-15T15:43:42Z,"I dug into this a bit more, but I think Matt is right and IRC notifications can't be conditioned on environment variables (I was hoping we'd be able to condition it on `TRAVIS_REPO_SLUG == bitcoin/bitcoin`). There's a very old issue to add conditional logic to notifications here: https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/1206. It doesn't look like it'll be implemented any time soon.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11598#issuecomment-344632802,344632802,
