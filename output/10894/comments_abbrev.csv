sipa,2017-07-21T20:00:35Z,It is unnecessary to add a new CChain object (3.5 MiB of RAM) for this. You can test whether `pindex` is an ancestor of `pindexBestHeader` using 'pindexBestHeader->GetAncestor(pindex->nHeight) == pindex`.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10894#issuecomment-317098736,317098736,
jonasschnelli,2017-07-24T07:16:18Z,"@sipa:\nFor the light client headers based fork detection the `FindFork()` method would be very handy. Maybe have a look at the ""sketch"" SPV code for the wallet: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9483/files#diff-b2bb174788c7409b671c46ccc86034bdR1182",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10894#issuecomment-317338725,317338725,
jonasschnelli,2017-07-24T07:17:56Z,"If one runs in full non validation mode (light client mode), the memory consumption would be ~the same, because only the headers chain will require memory (the `chainActive` will be empty).",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10894#issuecomment-317339024,317339024,
