isle2983,2017-01-26T17:05:17Z,"@laanwj Fair enough. Though, I am trying to figure out the shape of a system to perform a suite of checks for every PR as part of the normal TravisCI run. I believe the script needs to live in the same repo for that to work.\n\nWould it make sense to have a suite of scripts under `qa/`? Perhaps presented by a script named `qa/pull-tester/static-checks.py` similar to `rpc-tests.py`? I see a simil",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9632#issuecomment-275446107,275446107,

isle2983,2017-01-27T01:09:26Z,"I have read the IRC logs from earlier today, so I am in touch with the range of concern in this area. I also agree with @laanwj sentiment that circling through the same arguments is a waste of rare talent needed for important problems. That is why I am noobing it up writing code and trying to stay out of people's way.
