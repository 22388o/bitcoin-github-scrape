    "body": "@laanwj Fair enough. Though, I am trying to figure out the shape of a system to perform a suite of checks for every PR as part of the normal TravisCI run. I believe the script needs to live in the same repo for that to work.\r\n\r\nWould it make sense to have a suite of scripts under `qa/`? Perhaps presented by a script named `qa/pull-tester/static-checks.py` similar to `rpc-tests.py`? I see a similar pattern where there is one threshold of checks that must be passed, but then another category of checks that are probably more tentative (for whatever reason - false-positives, etc.).",

I hope to demonstrate a working proposal and the PR can either be rejected outright or fixed/improved by incorporating whatever feedback comes (and the feedback so far has been fantastic).\r\n\r\nThat being said, @MarcoFalke's mockup would be a great milestone. I see a trajectory of:\r\n\r\n1) getting a set of checks running in a consistent way (the TravisCI container looks perfect for that)\r\n2) establishing viewable metrics so they can be monitored\r\n\r\n After that, we can **optionally** continue into discussions of:\r\n\r\n3) improving the metrics with some bulk formatting in a minimally-disruptive way\r\n4) quantifying the amount of 'drift' in the wrong direction as PRs are merged over time\r\n5) enforcing some threshold in CI if it appears useful after seeing the actual data.\r\n\r\nFor now, I plan on writing a similar script for `clang-format` to report on the state of the code w.r.t. `src/.clang-format` and also investigating what is possible/reasonable to do with `.travis.yml` along this trajectory.",
