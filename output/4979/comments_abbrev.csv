Diapolo,2014-10-01T12:31:03Z,@sipa @laanwj Any ACK here?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4979#issuecomment-57456053,57456053,
TheBlueMatt,2014-10-01T17:45:17Z,You should provide some reasoning why this is actually useful.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4979#issuecomment-57505931,57505931,
Diapolo,2014-10-01T18:39:39Z,"IMHO a fully detailed description of the help message alone and the use of not single ""magic"" numbers (-timeout is perhaps not the best example ^^) in the code would be worth it for ALL parameters we have.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4979#issuecomment-57514215,57514215,
TheBlueMatt,2014-10-01T20:55:02Z,That didnt really answer the question. Why do you want to limit the user's minimum and maximum connection timeout?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4979#issuecomment-57536792,57536792,
sipa,2014-10-02T02:06:08Z,"utACK.\n\nThis doesn't change any behavior, just introduced constants.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4979#issuecomment-57570972,57570972,
TheBlueMatt,2014-10-02T02:15:11Z,OK. Better question...why do we have a max connect timeout?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4979#issuecomment-57571733,57571733,
laanwj,2014-10-02T07:29:22Z,"@TheBlueMatt good point. I think the max connect timeout should go, if a user wants to wait $maxint milis, that's up to them.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4979#issuecomment-57593270,57593270,
Diapolo,2014-10-02T08:39:52Z,It's no problem to implement that via this pull.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4979#issuecomment-57599025,57599025,
Diapolo,2014-10-02T09:18:37Z,"Updated, I get 2147483647 now, is that correct?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4979#issuecomment-57603236,57603236,
laanwj,2014-10-02T09:47:56Z,"@Diapolo please just remove the check for a maximum, not update the constant\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4979#issuecomment-57606029,57606029,
Diapolo,2014-10-02T09:49:45Z,"@laanwj What would happen then if someone enters 2147483648 for example, which is >maxint!?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4979#issuecomment-57606219,57606219,
laanwj,2014-10-02T09:51:05Z,"That should be handled by the number parser, not by an explicit check. Remember that checking `>=int_max` is a no-op as they can't contain a larger value than that.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4979#issuecomment-57606348,57606348,
Diapolo,2014-10-06T11:15:29Z,@laanwj Removed the max check and also simplified the code in init.\n@TheBlueMatt Thanks for your suggestion for this.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4979#issuecomment-58003236,58003236,

laanwj,2014-10-07T08:04:48Z,"Well the specific value of 0 for timeouts is meaningless. One has to give the physical world some time to respond. So are negative values. Not sure how much sense it makes to mention it though. Right now, the behaviour is that <=0 will select the default (it could also just fail).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4979#discussion_r18505490,18505490,src/init.cpp
