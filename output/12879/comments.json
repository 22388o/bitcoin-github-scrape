What would be good reasons to switch to a temporary fix when the permanent fix is already in place?\r\n\r\nA temporary fix in this case will generate follow-up PRs in the future that will require review time. Better let Travis take care of finding trivial mechanical issues via the lint script so that human reviewers can focus on the important higher level stuff.\r\n\r\nThe lint script is already written, it is really easy to read and the logic is so simple that the script is very unlikely to generate false positives or any maintenance burden going forward.

    "body": "> There is no harm in having the extern there. It is just a minor style change. With the same rationale we could start enforcing that all code is clang formatted, but that would not be maintainable. The linters are there to catch potential bugs and documentation inconsistencies, not minor style issues.\r\n\r\nI agree. Let's not over-burden the projects will all kinds of linters for trivial things. This seems over-zealous. There's no risk that a redundant 'extern' causes any actual bugs. It doesn't even cause confusion to developers reading the code.\r\n\r\nFYI I held back on writing `doc/developer-notes.md` for a long time because I was afraid of things like this. Everyone has their pet issues with code style. In the end I did, but added a clear rationale for everything mentioned. The rationale should always serve to avoid bugs and vulnerabilities, as well as other problems visible to end users.\r\n",

Using `extern` when you don't need to has no side effects, which means a lot of people think they have to use it. By forbidding it in new code, we free up time from reviewing other people who come in later to \"fix\" the problem. It's trivial to fix and perhaps even delightfully educational.\r\n\r\n@MarcoFalke \r\n\r\n> I'd also suggest to get rid of the scripted diff, it is easier to review without having to also review the scripted diff.\r\n\r\nI thought scripted diffs were implemented to make it *easier* to review, as you have an anchor in code that defines what you are changing. Is that not why they exist?\r\n",

Why not simply say \"I suggest you close this as it's too controversial to be merged.\" That at least gives me the opportunity to argue or close myself (that means I can reopen later if I have some bright idea for how to address the controversial points). I'm also not sure I agree that it's too controversial. After all, only two people have argued against it, and they are the sort of people with an open enough mind that discussion could convince them to change their opinion.\r\n\r\nWhether it's worth spending time on or not is a bit weird. We have spent 30 comments and a PR with code and review on this. Merging means we will never do so again, for this particular case at least, whereas not merging we may have this exact same discussion with different participants in a year from now about the same issue.",

I agree with @laanwj that this simply does not matter - extern or lack thereof doesn't convey any additional information, and does not prevent any bugs.\n\nI also believe we should not be enforcing random style opinions just because they increase consistency. That again leads to arbitrary rules that are an extra burden for developers without clear benefits.\n\nIf there is a widespread opinion among contributors and maintainers that a particul guideline is worth the burden, then I think it should be put in the style guide - and if it is, it sounds great to enforce it.\n\nI believe that is @MarcoFalke's point: the way to make this happen is discussing whether it should be a style guideline in the first place. After that we can have a discussion about a linter. Please don't see a PR being closed as the final step.",
