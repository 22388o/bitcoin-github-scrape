gmaxwell,2012-05-11T22:26:16Z,"I'm kind of inclined to say that we should just remove all the timestamps in messages.  It would be a lot cleaner then the conditional printfs in the patch.  If timestamps are off we could occasionally write markers in the log (E.g. once an hour, and at startup and shutdown).\n\n(I would just say we should enable timestamps always— but I wouldn't want to make it more attractive for people to compr",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1262#issuecomment-5662549,5662549,
Diapolo,2012-05-11T22:36:01Z,"If I had a wish, I would remove all additional timestamps from the source and only rely on the -logtimestamps switch, as this is way cleaner. Perhaps we can force -logtimestamps, if one enables -debug!?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1262#issuecomment-5662706,5662706,

gmaxwell,2012-05-12T23:56:26Z,"Since no one is protesting I think you should just go remove the manual timestamps.\n\nAs far as security goes,— we log too much that would be valuable to someone collecting logs already. Timestamps by default would make it worse.
