In terms of making the user make two/three calls to get at the info on whether or not a given added node is connected, I entirely disagree here.  I'll add a in/out/not connected flag.\n\n@sipa The goal is to allow a long-running node to add trusted nodes without having to restart.  In terms of having a one-shot connection, this was discussed back when addnode was changed, since it used to be a one-off, I was then of the opinion that addnode shouldn't be scrapped to allow for that and keepnode was clearer in this case...  In any case, I agree that there should be an option for a one-off connection creator RPC, Ill throw that in when I touch this up (connecttonode?).\n",

RPC \"addnode <IP Address> add\".\nCheck that a new connection to <IP Address> is made and \"getaddednodeinfo true\" gives the IP Address as connected/outbound.\nKill the node at <IP Address> and verify that it is now reported as unconnected in getaddednodeinfo/getpeerinfo.\nRestart the node at <IP Address> and verify a new connection is made.\nRPC \"addnode <IP Address> remove\" and check that the node is no longer in getaddednodeinfo and still connected (in getpeerinfo).\nKill the node at <IP Address> and restart and verify that no new connection to it is made.\n\nRPC \"addnode <DNS Name> add\" where DNS Name is just a simple single IP.\nVerify a new connection is made and \"getaddednodeinfo true\" shows the DNS Name in addition to the IP and the connection is outbound.\nChange the IP Address <DNS Name> points to and verify that there are now two connections open - one to the old IP Address, one to the new.\ngetaddednodeinfo should only show the new, getpeerinfo should show both.\nKill both nodes and restart, verify that only the new IP Address gets a new connection.\nChange <DNS Name> to point to two IP Addresses, verify that only one of the two nodes gets a new connection, kill that node, verify that the other node gets a new connection.\n",
