sipa,2014-10-06T22:04:25Z,"The headersfirst patch as-is allows a 1024-block download window, which means up to 1024 MiB, though in practice it will be a lot less. I think we'll want to change the download window to a bytes limits rather than a block count, but that's nontrivial, and shouldn't be a blocker.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5051#issuecomment-58107502,58107502,

If it fills that up, it will still be able to function as it remembers where the block is.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5051#issuecomment-58142910,58142910,
