benma,2017-02-23T08:46:36Z,"Done (also in bitcoin.cpp).\n\nFor my information: how should I address feedback: with new commits for easier review, or with amending? I amended this time.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9833#discussion_r102663505,102663505,src/init.cpp
laanwj,2017-02-23T08:52:23Z,"For documentation/string commits like this, amending is best IMO.\nFor more involved commits, it can make sense to keep a history, at least until merge.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9833#discussion_r102664400,102664400,src/init.cpp
