I've updated #21690 to fix the new issue and make the scoped addr assertion be per-platform (macOS, and all others).

MarcoFalke,2021-04-17 09:50:54,I am seeing intermittent issues for years that are still waiting for someone to report an issue on. So a lack of a report doesn't imply the issue didn't exist when it was introduced.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21689#issuecomment-821798215,821798215,
jonatack,2021-04-17 10:48:03,"Sure, but the fix I proposed was a smaller change than this one (two lines changed, one of which was a comment) and did not drop coverage and context.
