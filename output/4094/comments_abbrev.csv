Michagogo,2014-04-26T20:19:11Z,Is this Qt build a full one? I ask because I know that the Qt build for Windows is huge and takes a very long time... and also runs out of disk space on older Gitian VMs.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4094#issuecomment-41479656,41479656,

laanwj,2014-04-27T06:48:03Z,"@Michagogo It builds all of the Qt developer tools (moc, uic, qrelease,...) needed for the build, as well as the headers, not the whole thing.\n\n@gmaxwell It indeed isn't too bad. At some point in the future, when more Linux distributions start to use Qt5 (exclusively) we may want to ship an executable built against that as well. But it's not worth to have a fuss about 4.6 versus 4.8.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4094#issuecomment-41489710,41489710,

The (dynamic) Qt library that is linked picks up some of these symbols (instead of those from the older OS's library), causing the crash.\n\nI don't want to export symbols from the executable at all.
