laanwj,2015-03-12T09:45:43Z,Does s_instance ever get freed?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5880#discussion_r26288418,26288418,src/qt/macdockiconhandler.mm
jonasschnelli,2015-03-12T09:54:25Z,No. It's a singleton pattern and i assume the OS will care about the cleanup.\nBut i could try to proactive free it within the destructor of `~MacDockIconHandler`. But this might be more or less the same cleanup as the os does.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5880#discussion_r26288841,26288841,src/qt/macdockiconhandler.mm
laanwj,2015-03-13T07:41:25Z,"I'd prefer if it was freed. Otherwise it will show up as a memory leak. Would be even better to do it without introducing a singleton, but I suppose that isn't possible.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5880#discussion_r26368989,26368989,src/qt/macdockiconhandler.mm
