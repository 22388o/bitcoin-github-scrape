laanwj,2012-05-17T21:57:06Z,"Ok, removed the font tag completely.\n\nI've also made it so that the (out of sync) label appears directly after Wallet and Recent transactions, and is not aligned to the middle.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1346#issuecomment-5775237,5775237,
Diapolo,2012-05-17T22:03:32Z,"I can't verify that change by just looking at the diff, which hits me hard, but ACK to the intention :D.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1346#issuecomment-5775360,5775360,
laanwj,2012-05-17T22:11:24Z,Why not simply try it out?\n\n```\n$ git add remote wumpus https://github.com/laanwj/bitcoin.git\n$ git fetch wumpus\n$ git checkout wumpus/2012_05_overviewpage_restore\n$ (build...)\n```\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1346#issuecomment-5775516,5775516,
Diapolo,2012-05-17T22:15:58Z,"I guess you will LOL, when I tell you how I test commits. Merged ones to master go into Bitcoin, I fetch them via git fetch upstream, rebase and then open a file-compare-tool and add every changed line into my test-build and compile it. Now next problem was I did never use other remotes, just the bitcoin one, but I will try your commands tomorrow :), it's late.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1346#issuecomment-5775587,5775587,
laanwj,2012-05-17T22:30:53Z,"Hehe, that does sounds quite inefficient indeed.\n\nThe simplest way to do it is to `git clone https://github.com/laanwj/bitcoin.git` into a new directory then check out the branch `git checkout 2012_05_overviewpage_restore`. Then build from there.\n\nRemotes are essentially the same, but allow for tracking multiple remote repositories from one local git repository. This can be useful, for example",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1346#issuecomment-5775826,5775826,
Diapolo,2012-05-17T22:36:42Z,"Thanks for this Git lesson :). I'm already advancing, my first pulls were done via merges and I created so much mess, Con (developer of CGMINER) still hates me for them I guess ^^.\n\nWould a `git clone https://github.com/laanwj/bitcoin.git bitcoin_wumpus` work, so that I can use bitcoin_wumpus as directory? Do I need to fork your repo via the Github website first? Btw. which tag are you using to ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1346#issuecomment-5775939,5775939,
laanwj,2012-05-17T22:40:30Z,"Yes, that's would work well. You don't have to do anything on the github website. You can make as many local clones and forks as you want, that's the advantage of a distributed VCS.\n\nI use `` (backticks) for the commands.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1346#issuecomment-5776002,5776002,

Diapolo,2012-05-18T07:57:27Z,"I need your help GIT-wise, sorry to OT this discussion :).\nI did:\n\n`git clone git://github.com/laanwj/bitcoin.git -b master bitcoin_wumpus`\n`cd bitcoin_wumpus`\n`git remote add upstream git://github.com/laanwj/bitcoin.git -m master`\n`git fetch upstream -p`\n`git checkout 2012_05_overviewpage`\n\nWhich leads me to a `error: pathspec '2012_05_overviewpage' did not match any file(s) known to git",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1346#issuecomment-5781393,5781393,

Diapolo,2012-05-18T08:20:39Z,"I guess I should have added `_restore`, now it worked :). Checked out the changes and they work and look good, so ACK!\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1346#issuecomment-5781645,5781645,
