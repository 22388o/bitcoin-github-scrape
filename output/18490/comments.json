If you're building code that isn't in this repository (that also modifies dependencies), I don't think there's an expectation that our symbol/security checks should pass.\r\n\r\nDoes this mean you're planning on reopening #17213 (the rebased version of #14137)? That was closed due to [lack of interest](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17213#issuecomment-591213273), and I still don't think it's something worthwhile merging. Regardless, if changes need to be made to scripts to accommodate that, they should be part of that PR.\r\n\r\n> What do you mean?\r\n\r\nI mean there's no point being lenient in these scripts if we don't need to be. As mentioned by @laanwj, given we control the input, and outputs are deterministic (otherwise there's an actual bug), I'm happy for us to keep checking for the exact libraries we expect. Even though in reality it may not be possible, there's no need to allow the output to contain a `a.dll` and/or `a.DLL`, and I'd rather the build fail if the output from gitian suddenly changes.",
