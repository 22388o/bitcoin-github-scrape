ycshao,2020-06-08 13:12:50,"Seems like the style of those files are auto-formatted by `autopep8`. I'll leave the reviewers to comment about the format. \n\nOne question about the implementation. Does it make sense  to move `assert (all([len(x.getpeerinfo()) for x in rpc_connections]))` up to immediately after the while loop starts? It will assert sooner and save some time and operations.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19208#issuecomment-640594378,640594378,

adamjonas,2020-06-09 14:03:18,"@ycshao DrahtBot crawls over open PRs and alerts you when there is a conflict with the main branch that requires a rebase or, in this case, other PRs that may lead to future conflicts indicating that you are working on similar code.

adamjonas,2020-06-09 15:48:13,"Re the format - autopep8 is making the diff much larger. I think it's easier, for now, to keep the diff as minimal as possible so reviewers can focus on the changes relevant to your patch. At the very least, you can break the formatting changes into their own commit and follow the lead of this [reformat](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19206/commits/faedb50d89cf113084adfa50c280c295c95571a8",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19208#issuecomment-641392613,641392613,

ycshao,2020-06-09 21:07:33,"> Oo first PR? Concept ACK :) I'm guessing ""contextual information of test framework"" is the `timeout_factor`?\n\nYeah for now `timeout_factor` is easiest to be used. There are other things potentially can be used. I'm open to suggestions.\n* `rpc_timeout` - I think `rpc_timeout` is usually sometime different than timeout people want to configure for syncing operations.

glozow,2020-06-09 19:24:50,"I have a question - it's probably not a big deal to require at least one node to be updated, but would it be appropriate to have an optional `blockhash` parameter and enforce that hash instead?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19208#discussion_r437665086,437665086,test/functional/test_framework/test_framework.py
ycshao,2020-06-09 21:51:39,I don't see a use case like that in current code. But I think one benefit your idea will give is to shorten test run time if the block we need to sync to is not usually the tip. ,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19208#discussion_r437743043,437743043,test/functional/test_framework/test_framework.py

ycshao,2020-06-18 17:05:10,I feel it's better to add it when it will be used in instead of putting it there up front just because some time in the future it might be used.
