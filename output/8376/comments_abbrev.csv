laanwj,2016-07-21T15:37:12Z,"> I think the reason is to aid debugging?\n\nIn the current code, for debug log messages the `__func__` is often added, as those messages are formatted anyway.\nHowever exceptions are usually just plain strings.\n\nOne could use strprintf(). Hardcoding the function name is ill-advised because people always forget to change it when they move the code.\n\nI don't think it's extremely useful - usuall",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8376#issuecomment-234292632,234292632,

pstratem,2016-07-20T08:02:59Z,There is no way for SetHDMasterKey to fail currently.\n\nHowever if that changes in the future it would be best that the failure was handled cleanly.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8376#discussion_r71481295,71481295,src/wallet/wallet.cpp
MarcoFalke,2016-07-20T08:06:08Z,It is not clear to me when to use `return false` over `throw`.\n\nWouldn't it make sense to modify SetHDMasterKey() to `return false`?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8376#discussion_r71481696,71481696,src/wallet/wallet.cpp

I think it would help if someone added a short sentence to https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/developer-notes.md about returning a bool vs throwing an exception.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8376#discussion_r71486271,71486271,src/wallet/wallet.cpp
