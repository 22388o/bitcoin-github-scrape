        "patch": "@@ -381,3 +381,51 @@ GUI\n   - *Rationale*: Model classes pass through events and data from the core, they\n     should not interact with the user. That's where View classes come in. The converse also\n     holds: try to not directly access core data structures from Views.\n+\n+Git and github tips\n+---------------------\n+\n+- For resolving merge/rebase conflicts, it can be useful to enable diff3 style using\n+  `git config merge.conflictstyle diff3`. Instead of\n+\n+        <<<\n+        yours\n+        ===\n+        theirs\n+        >>>\n+\n+  you will see\n+\n+        <<<\n+        yours\n+        |||\n+        original\n+        ===\n+        theirs\n+        >>>\n+\n+  This may make it much clearer what caused the conflict. In this style, you can often just look\n+  at what changed between *original* and *theirs*, and mechanically apply that to *yours* (or the other way around).\n+\n+- When reviewing patches which change indentation in C++ files, use `git diff -w` and `git show -w`. This makes\n+  the diff algorithm ignore whitespace changes. This feature is also available on github.com, by adding `?w=1`\n+  at the end of any URL which shows a diff.\n+\n+- When reviewing patches that change symbol names in many places, use `git diff --word-diff`. This will instead\n+  of showing the patch as deleted/added *lines*, show deleted/added *words*.\n+\n+- When reviewing patches that move code around, try using\n+  `git diff --patience commit~:old/file.cpp commit:new/file/name.cpp`, and ignoring everything except the\n+  moved body of code which should show up as neither `+` or `-` lines. In case it was not a pure move, this may\n+  even work when combined with the `-w` or `--word-diff` options described above.\n+\n+- When looking at other's pull requests, it may make sense to add the following section to your `.git/config`\n+  file:\n+\n+        [remote \"upstream-pull\"]\n+                fetch = +refs/pull/*:refs/remotes/upstream-pull/*\n+                url = git@github.com:bitcoin/bitcoin.git\n+\n+  This will add an `upstream-pull` remote to your git repository, which can be fetched using `git fetch --all`\n+  or `git fetch upstream-pull`. Afterwards, you can use `upstream-pull/NUMBER/head` in arguments to `git show`,\n+  `git checkout` and anywhere a commit id would be acceptable to see the changes from pull request NUMBER."
