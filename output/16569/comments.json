    "body": "My opinion is that if bitcoin core truly does hang in a way that does not recover automatically, that it should not just be killed and restarted. It's (imho) better to require manual intervention and let whoever runs the node decide if it is still ok to still trust that node. \r\n\r\nBut that is my preference, at the very least I think the current timeout should be reconsidered as it appears to be far too short for common usecases, and (especially during IBD) waiting for a clean shutdown saves a lot of time compared to the long \"rolling forward\" sequence triggered by an unclean shutdown.",
