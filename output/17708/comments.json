    "body": "Specifying the alignment requirement at the prevector level instead of for `prevector::_union` would also work (ie, `class alignas(char*) prevector {`) and would be a smaller change, but it would be more fragile (breaking if `N*sizeof(T)` isn't a multiple of `alignof(size_type)`, or `sizeof(size_type)*2` didn't match `alignof(char*)`) , so keeping the pack pragma covering only the code that it absolutely needs to seems better.",

If we could have a union between those two, with a guarantee the two first fields are merged, we'd be done. But because the language forces us to construct an explicit type for the ((size, pointer) or (bytearray)) structure, it on itself has a stronger alignment than if it were \"inlined\" so to speak.\r\n\r\nThat said, I see no way to accomplish that that is guaranteed legal, so ACK.",

P2SH fits in 32, but a segwit output should be 33 bytes long... unless I'm missing some case where 28 is a common size nowadays.",
