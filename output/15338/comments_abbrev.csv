fanquake,2019-02-04T13:56:43Z,Concept ACK running tests on a BSD. Is this on Cirrus CI because we've run out of capacity with Travis?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15338#issuecomment-460258201,460258201,

laanwj,2019-02-04T20:06:50Z,"While I like the idea of adding BSDs, I'm not sure I'd like to add yet another different, incompatible CI besides AppVeyor and Travis.

MarcoFalke,2019-02-04T20:46:44Z,"I tend to agree that our ci turns into a jungle of traffic lights that no one really knows how to handle. Also, I am not aware of the last time something broke on freebsd, so adding this has little value.

laanwj,2019-02-05T16:59:59Z,"> I think the benefit of testing in diverse environments outweighs the maintenance cost.\n\nThis is not a matter of ""maintenance cost"". I agree the CI script itself needs very little maintenance.\n\nThe problem is that every PR kind of becomes a slot machine of different CIs. I think it will fail much more often randomly than due to an actual problem.
