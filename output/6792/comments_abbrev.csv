gmaxwell,2015-10-09T21:45:11Z," I agree that it's not needed if it defaults to off, but I'm curious as to why @bluematt thinks discovery isn't sufficiently related!  I would think that a user manually setting externalip and/or discovery=0 almost (but not quite) guarantees that they do not need upnp on (and if they do-- they probably know that)\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6792#issuecomment-146992790,146992790,
TheBlueMatt,2015-10-09T21:56:12Z,"UPnP isn't just about IP discovery? Indeed it's useful for that but we don't even really need that now, no? If it's not about discovery, then it's primarily about port mapping, and while I agree that many users who are paying enough attention to set their IP manually will also map their ports manually, I'm not sure we should make that assumption.\n\nOn October 9, 2015 2:45:19 PM PDT, Gregory Maxwe",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6792#issuecomment-146995458,146995458,

This changes the default it does not force the setting. So in that (arguably rare) case people can do `-upnp=1` to override the default.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6792#issuecomment-147066022,147066022,
