My hope is that with the pattern being more widespread in the code, awareness for this raises and hence it is on the long term easier catched both by PR creators and by reviewers. Not sure if that's enough -- adding it as rule to the linter seems to be too strong though, agree with laanwj here.\r\n\r\nFor anyone wanting to try out the linters: note that (at least on my system) `pylint` is for linting Python 2 code, hence we should ensure to use `pylint3` here, which interestingly enough also detects a bit more. (Some systems may have a symlink from `pylint` to `pylint3`, but better check via `pylint --version`.)",
