At 1MB/year increase, it'd take 10 years to reach 12MB block size. 10 years ago the iPhone didn't exist. 12MB + SW would mean around 5million tx/day.

arsenische,2015-12-19T03:17:35Z,2Mb is better than 1Mb.\n\nBut the block size limit should be constrained ONLY by technology (that grows exponentially):\n\n```\nblock_size_limit = base_bock_size_limit * projected_growth_rate ^ n_of_blocks_since_the_fork\n```\n\nIsn't it obvious that the projected_growth_rate should be greater than 1?

jameshilliard,2015-12-19T03:27:50Z,@arsenische \n\n> But block size should be constrained ONLY by technology that grows exponentially:\n\nThe main problem is that there are a lot of bottlenecks that can be hard to predict. Any sort of exponential or even linear scaling can be risky if the rate is too high or if they don't have a ceiling.

DavidVorick,2015-12-19T04:49:59Z,"@arsenische It's not always clearly in the miner's best interests to reduce a block size.
