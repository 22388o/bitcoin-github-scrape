Tested with some hacks to p2p-segwit.py to verify that the default_witness_commitment is correct (afaik there was no explicit test for this before(?)), and that it is only produced if the segwit softfork is defined and the client specifies the segwit rule in the gbt call.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9189#issuecomment-261646748,261646748,
