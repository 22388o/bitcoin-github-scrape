    "body": "re-ACK\n\nThe previous pull request went around and around in an ultimately circular discussion.  I disagree that the multi-balance situation is a blocker for this PR.  Multi-balance has existed since the beginning of bitcoin, in the form of confirmed/unconfirmed balance.  Add on top of that multi-sig.  On top of that, locked outputs.  Adding public-key-only to the wallet is elegant and does not overly complicate the existing multi-balance situation.\n\nThe alternatives only truly make sense if multi-wallet support is deployed and fleshed out, making it trivial to divide up your coins across wallets without restarts etc.  Otherwise, your choice is either running N copies of bitcoind -- in parallel if real-time wallet access is required, or this pull req.\n\nThat is the fundamental design choice.  We are not close to multi-wallet, and this PR has people actively using it.  This and coin control are two features that seem to continue to be requested, and IMO, need to be pushed based on user feedback.\n",

Well -- apart from getrawtransaction which can see spendable/unspendable status. But there is no way to see this at a glance.\n",

    "body": "Hi guys,\n\nI'm investigating a problem where importaddress fails to find unspents sent to the imported address, even when rescan is set to true. I'm currently using https://github.com/sipa/bitcoin/tree/watchonly, so I haven't tested with this latest rebase yet, but I wanted to bring this up ASAP incase this is an issue that has not yet been discovered.\n\nReproducing is pretty simple with a private testnet-in-a-box:\n\nImport an address:\n\n```\n$ bitcoind -datadir=2 importaddress mhou3jmi6Snxw4Y7nszn7gFTbUzHdiBt9y 'test' false\n```\n\nSend to that address from the mining process:\n\n```\n$ bitcoind -datadir=1 sendtoaddress mhou3jmi6Snxw4Y7nszn7gFTbUzHdiBt9y 1\n```\n\nConfirm the unspent has been sent:\n\n```\n$ bitcoind -datadir=2 listunspent 0\n[\n    {\n        \"txid\" : \"36016dffdfb5ca0d571f30349fa772123ac92be814c7945d6155869785e1f7d3\",\n        \"vout\" : 1,\n        \"address\" : \"mhou3jmi6Snxw4Y7nszn7gFTbUzHdiBt9y\",\n        \"account\" : \"test\",\n        \"scriptPubKey\" : \"76a91419249cd3bf74403fd1e918cc4cc07545b7b8cc2c88ac\",\n        \"amount\" : 1.00000000,\n        \"confirmations\" : 0,\n        \"spendable\" : false\n    }\n]\n```\n\nKill the second bitcoind, delete the wallet file, restart:\n\n```\n$ kill `cat 2/testnet3/bitcoind.pid`\n$ rm 2/testnet3/wallet.dat\n$ bitcoind -datadir=2 -daemon\n```\n\nReimport the address:\n\n```\n$ bitcoind -datadir=2 importaddress mhou3jmi6Snxw4Y7nszn7gFTbUzHdiBt9y 'test' true\n```\n\nLook for unspents, and they no longer appear:\n\n```\n$ bitcoind -datadir=2 listunspent 0\n[\n]\n```\n\nAny ideas/thoughts on this? I might have to disable wallet imports if I can't figure this one out soon.\n",

    "body": "So, there are two instances where something \"IsMine\"-like occurs in non-GUI code that returns a bool, and not an isminetype:\n- In CWallet::IsMine(CTransaction), we return a bool because it's not about a particular output being spendable or not, just about whether the transaction is relevant to our wallet. So, this is correct. It would be more clear if the method were renamed to CWallet::IsRelevant or something.\n- The NotifyAddressBoolChanged signal passes a bool along to indicate whether a destination is ours or not. If we wanted to distinguish in the GUI whether listed addresses of ours are considered spendable-from, then it may make sense to upgrade that bool to an isminetype, but that will depend on the GUI using it for something.\n",

    "body": "Yesterday, I decided to fork bitcoin/bitcoin and applied #3383 using:\n curl https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3383.diff | patch -p1\n\nPatch applied without issue, and we're now running a watch-only wallet. Over 10,000 addresses have been imported, and a mere ~15 minutes after starting rescan we were ready to rock. Wallet balance is accurate - so it looks like rescan picked up everything without issue.\n\nThank you for putting this patch out there and considering(?) it for 0.9.0. Prior to this point, we were heavily dependent upon blockchain.info's rawaddr/total_received API function. With hot-button topics such as transaction malleability, MITM attacks, and further decentralization of the bitcoin network. It would be immensely useful to leverage watch-only (e.g. public keys only) wallets when integrating a web app with bitcoind.\n",

Compared to what is suggested by this PR, copying a one-way-encrypted wallet file is much easier, especially if people know to use -keypool to ensure they never need to generate new keys in the wallet again. And yes, as you note, BIP32 will make it even easier Real Soon Now.\n",

That would be one of the major use cases, IMO - the ability to easily author transactions for later signing by your offline keys. \n",

    "body": "My interpretation of @luke-jr's argument is that this allows building a wallet from arbitrary addresses, allowing tracking of transaction to individual address, and their spendability, essentially providing \"balance of an address\" - management at the address level rather than at the wallet level.\n\nI agree that is unfortunate, and shouldn't be encouraged, but it is no different than allowing importing individual private keys in the first place, which also allows that level of micromanagement.\n\nA higher-level solution is using watch-only wallets, using public BIP32 chains, rather than needing to build them yourself from individual addresses. That isn't available right now, however, and will not work for all legacy systems anyway.\n\n@luke-jr Correct me if I'm wrong, of course.\n",

    "body": "I get that the watchonly patch is not popular with the core team. I would like to propose an alternative idea here and get your thoughts on it.\n\nMy alternative idea is to have bitcoind compile an index of all the existing utxos in the blockchain, with the address as the key.\n\nThis is not related to the wallet. Instead, it's exactly the same idea as the `txindex`. You could have a flag to bitcoind when it starts as such:\n\n`utxoindex=1`\n\nSignaling that you would like this. Then, there could be an api call to retreive the current list of utxos for addresses:\n\n`getutxos <address> [confirmations]`\n\nOr something similar. It wouldn't be a wallet or related to the wallet code - it would just be an index of utxos, simple as that.\n\nDoes this satiate the concerns core has with the watchonly patch?\n",

    "body": "The current way to do this outside of bitcoind is to manually scan the entire blockchain from bitcoind using the RPC and write code to track all of this elsewhere, which is 1) difficult to do safely (and correctly the first time), 2) requires a lot of code duplication that bitcoind already does, and 3) takes a very long time. It's also lead to stability issues when for example blockchain.info had a database issue and had to manually rescan their entire database. It's a really byzantine solution to the problem, one that is best handled by bitcoind IMHO and really could have nothing to do with the wallet code.\n",
