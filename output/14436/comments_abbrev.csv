conscott,2018-10-11T15:24:12Z,"I'm probably being thick, but from this comment it's not entirely clear to me if subsequent peers relaying a previously non-accepted tx aren't punished because: \n1. The possibility of false positive inherent to bloom filters\n2. The transactions can be added to recentRejects _without_ penalizing the peer (due to something like node policy), so just matching the filter doesn't give us enough inf",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14436#discussion_r224493304,224493304,src/net_processing.cpp

MarcoFalke,2018-11-07T16:49:07Z,"It sounds a bit like we *want* to penalize subsequent peers if we could. Though, I think this is not true, since we have not experienced any further damage by this ""malicious"" action (compared to lets say a ""honest"" relay of a transaction that we already have).\n\nSo if we hit recentRejects, we are not interested in the DoS score because it would be too expensive to calculate for almost no gain ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14436#discussion_r231586816,231586816,src/net_processing.cpp
