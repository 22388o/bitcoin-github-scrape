theuni,2013-09-12T01:10:03Z,"@sipa fyi, now you can easily run the same scripts as pull-tester to check locally, in case you're looking into fixing up the block-tester. Just add --with-comparison-tool to your configure, and this test will be enabled during 'make check':\n\n```\n./configure --with-comparison-tool=/tmp/BitcoindComparisonTool.jar\nmake\nmake check\n```\n\nIf you replace the .jar, just 'make check' again.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2964#issuecomment-24288529,24288529,
sipa,2013-09-13T11:08:09Z,"Rebased, though I haven't investigated the pulltester failure further.\n\nI assume it has to do with actually changed semantics, as the best known not-known-to-be-invalid header chain is always considered the main chain, and pindexBest is always within this chain. As the decision is not just made per-received-block, you could have a valid chain A-B-C, and another chain A-B-C'-D, where D is invalid",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2964#issuecomment-24387506,24387506,

sipa,2013-09-17T21:27:18Z,"@TheBlueMatt (as discussed on IRC) Yes, this gets us further already, but it seems the getheaders implementation in the comparison tool is too incomplete to do a successful multi-block reorg with headers-first. So this means fixing that becomes sort of a blocker for this; unfortunately, I don't have the time any time soon to look into that.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2964#issuecomment-24623948,24623948,
