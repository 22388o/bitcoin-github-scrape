mikehearn,2014-06-19T18:14:18Z,"I worry that this will have the same effect as the fee drop - users and merchants will upgrade, miners won't, and the resulting lack of mempool consensus makes double spending easier. When we did the fee drop we didn't worry about this much because we'd done it before and it worked out OK, but this time seems to be different and miners aren't bothering to upgrade, perhaps because 0.9 had nothing f",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4365#issuecomment-46596692,46596692,
petertodd,2014-06-19T18:35:38Z,@mikehearn Are we going to hold up every feature just because it might impact zeroconf transactions? Eligius already has implemented this patch with ~10% of hashing power; if you're worried about double-spends that opportunity already exists.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4365#issuecomment-46599332,46599332,
petertodd,2014-06-20T13:21:47Z,"ACK modulo CHECKMULTISIG nit.\n\nI had been working on my own version of this patch and came up with a pretty similar design. Tested this with real-world non-std P2SH transactions on mainnet, no issues found. I also can't see any way that this could be a DoS issue - the 'limit sigops' approach taken is exactly how my version worked as well.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4365#issuecomment-46677073,46677073,

petertodd,2014-06-20T13:20:02Z,Pedantic: This example isn't actually spendable. Right now the first CHECKMULTISIG will leave a '1' on the stack making the second CHECKMULTISIG always fail. Change it to a CHECKMULTISIGVERIFY instead and remove the AND.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4365#discussion_r14018609,14018609,src/test/script_P2SH_tests.cpp
