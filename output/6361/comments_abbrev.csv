theuni,2015-07-02T04:30:55Z,"@laanwj yes, we need to go ahead with the boost bump. I'm getting ready to leave for a few days for a conference, but I'll make the boost/qt bumps first priority when I get back. Ideally those should be done very early in the cycle so we have some testing.\n\nTaking that one step further, I'll check the other deps while I'm at it and see if they need bumps too.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6361#issuecomment-117901917,117901917,
