jonasschnelli,2016-02-22T09:18:12Z,Thanks!\nWould it be possible to write a RPC test that produces some coin-joins and could therefore be used to test/ensure that the fix does what is says?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7569#issuecomment-187085400,187085400,

GUI tests are notoriously difficult, and besides that, the unit test framework things too low-level to be conveniently able to test high-level functionality such as transaction lists.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7569#issuecomment-190113906,190113906,
