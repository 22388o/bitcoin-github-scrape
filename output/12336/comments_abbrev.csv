jnewbery,2018-02-08T14:12:24Z,"> I would reword commit ""[tests] Remove tests for deprecated estimatefee RPC"" to ""[qa] Replace deprecated estimatefee with estimatesmartfee"".\n\nThat's not what the commit does. It removes the tests for estimatefee and leaves the (minimal) checking of estimatesmartfee in place.\n\nPlease see original comment:\n\n> The `feature_fee_estimation.py` test has been updated to remove the RPC, but d",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12336#issuecomment-364122999,364122999,

laanwj,2018-02-06T09:41:35Z,"Please add a comment here that newly deprecated functionality should be tested here, otherwise this empty function looks really strange.\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to remove this test entirely if it's empty, It can always be brought back.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12336#discussion_r166234757,166234757,test/functional/rpc_deprecated.py

promag,2018-02-08T11:32:51Z,IMO should stay otherwise it's easy to add deprecated tests elsewhere. A comment would be nice.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12336#discussion_r166907207,166907207,test/functional/rpc_deprecated.py

promag,2018-02-08T11:39:15Z,I guess there is no need for `\n`. There are other multiple sentence errors without it.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12336#discussion_r166908753,166908753,src/rpc/mining.cpp

jnewbery,2018-02-08T14:06:00Z,ugh. This error message was split over two lines before the commit. Please can we focus on reviewing the code changes and not how many new lines there should be in error messages?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12336#discussion_r166942468,166942468,src/rpc/mining.cpp
