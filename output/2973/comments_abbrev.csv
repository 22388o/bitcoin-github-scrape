laanwj,2013-09-06T10:29:32Z,"I don't think it is useful to send all the logging to the debug window, I've thought about that in the beginning but we simply log so much for that it would bog down the GUI and it would not be useful either. At least with the current console widget. I guess it'd be possible to add a tab ""logging"" with a hyper-optimized scrolling widget, but I doubt it's worth the trouble and extra code.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2973#issuecomment-23931346,23931346,
laanwj,2013-09-05T09:59:26Z,"I wonder why you add `()` to the function names? In case of overloaded functions I guess it could make sense to add the argument types to the signature, but an empty `()` seems unnecessary.\n\nEdit: btw you can use `__func__` to get the current function name\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2973#discussion_r6177693,6177693,src/qt/paymentrequestplus.cpp
