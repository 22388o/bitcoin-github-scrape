But I believe the only other line of code you need for this patch is one additional RPCTypeCheck right here:\n\n```\nRPCTypeCheck(prevOut, map_list_of(""redeemScript"",str_type), true);\n```\n\nThe rest of the existing code should then Do The Right Thing.  The third arg to RPCTypeCheck will make redeemScript optional...\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2264#discussion_r2869789,2869789,src/rpcrawtransaction.cpp
