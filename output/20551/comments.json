    "body": "I think #19315 handles tests more thoroughly than this (given that PR actually makes the tests use the functionality).\r\n\r\nFor mainnet, I don't think `feeler` or `addrfetch` connections would have much benefit, and `block-relay-only` connections should already be maintained where possible via #17428 and trying to manually tweak them probably doesn't make much sense. I think that mostly leaves privileged-vs-non-priviliged, ie `manual` vs `outbound-full-relay` which seems plausible.\r\n\r\nIs there actually any reason why `onetry` shouldn't always be `outbound-full-relay` instead of `manual`? If you actually want to preserve the connection, then reconnecting if it drops out seems like a must, but onetry doesn't do that.\r\n\r\nMatt's point stands though -- creating an additional `OUTBOUND_FULL_RELAY` connection will make `semOutbound` inconsistent with the `nOutboundFullRelay` count in `ThreadOpenConnections` which leads to misbehaviour. I think it's along the lines of repeatedly opening a 9th outbound connection, then closing an outbound connection because it only wants to keep 8 around, but there might be some further nuance to it.",

Does it fix a bug, if so which one, does it need backporting? Even if you don't think there is anything new information to add from #12674, you should at least be pointing out that there was a previous PR, and associated discussion. I'm not really sure why a new PR was required over #12674.\r\n\r\nPlease rebase the branch so it will actually compile and the CI will run. There's also at least [one bug](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20551#issuecomment-738211959) that needs fixing.\r\n\r\nAs much as you don't seem to believe that [issues raised](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12674#issuecomment-377004019) in the previous version of this PR are relevant, clearly you need to better explain why that is the case. This is the kind of thing you'd summarize and make clear in the PR description, rather than leaving it empty and making reviewers chase down the changes history, just to have them re-asked the same questions as in previous PR.",

    "body": "I agree with Luke-jr that it's weird that onetry gets privileged treatment.\r\n\r\nWhen I split addnodes into their own connection pool I would have probably treated onetrys like ordinary automatic connections if I'd even given the matter any thought. If I did give it thought perhaps I didn't do it because it's not instantly obvious how to handle the outbound connection limit.  I think under the original behaviour of onetry (and the original purpose of it, to help a node that was having problems getting good peers get a good peer so that it could learn peers) that if outbounds were full that the onetry would just do nothing. I think that behaviour is still defensible, but I simultaneously see how it could be a little surprising.\r\n\r\nI agree with aj that the default behaviour of onetry should just be like an automatic connection.  If that were accomplished (correctly) then I think there would be little need for other additions.\r\n\r\nI don't think exposing connection types directly is a good change, except perhaps as some kind of hidden testing feature:  Their meaning depends on complex/subtle internal behaviour that will change from release to release.  Also being able to handle a user introduced connection of arbitrary type may require excessive generality for little gain.  I also doubt that exotic usage of addnode types is likely to get adequate testing or review-- so this is a functionality that I would expect to bitrot, or-- to the extent that it's useful at all-- have its usefulness broken by future developers that don't understand the usage (or just by accident, because it's not being used at all by people who review the software).\r\n",

    "body": "I think the following would allow `onetry` to be a normal outbound-full-relay connection while keeping the maximums correctly limited. If there's already 8 outbounds, this will use the \"feeler\" slot to bump that up to 9 outbounds, and sometime later one outbound will be evicted -- probably the one you just added unless a new block appears in the meantime. If desired, you could call `disconnectnode Y; addnode X onetry` to reduce to 7 outbounds first so that you'll likely keep the onetry.\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n--- a/src/net.h\r\n+++ b/src/net.h\r\n@@ -543,7 +543,9 @@ private:\r\n      */\r\n     ServiceFlags nLocalServices;\r\n \r\n+public: // hax0r\r\n     std::unique_ptr<CSemaphore> semOutbound;\r\n+private:\r\n     std::unique_ptr<CSemaphore> semAddnode;\r\n     int nMaxConnections;\r\n \r\n--- a/src/rpc/net.cpp\r\n+++ b/src/rpc/net.cpp\r\n@@ -301,8 +301,12 @@ static RPCHelpMan addnode()\r\n \r\n     if (strCommand == \"onetry\")\r\n     {\r\n+        CSemaphoreGrant grant(*node.connman->semOutbound, true);\r\n+        if (!grant) {\r\n+            throw JSONRPCError(RPC_CLIENT_NODE_NOT_ADDED, \"Error: No free outbound connection slots.\");\r\n+        }\r\n         CAddress addr;\r\n-        node.connman->OpenNetworkConnection(addr, false, nullptr, strNode.c_str(), ConnectionType::MANUAL);\r\n+        node.connman->OpenNetworkConnection(addr, false, &grant, strNode.c_str(), ConnectionType::OUTBOUND_FULL_RELAY);\r\n         return NullUniValue;\r\n     }\r\n```\r\n\r\nConceivably could also make `-connect` be outbound-full-relay connections rather than manual -- though given if you drop one of them for misbehaving you won't try reconnecting to anywhere else, that might be a bad idea.
