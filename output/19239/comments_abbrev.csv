MarcoFalke,2020-06-10 16:29:07,"Concept ACK on moving wif to wallet_util, but it was simply not clear to me that base58 is not allowed to be moved into its own module. I think in the past we had more issues due to files being used for too much (main.cpp, util.cpp, ...) than files being used for too little. The question might be stylistic, so I will refrain from having an opinion. I am fine with keeping base58 in a separate modul",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19239#issuecomment-642121396,642121396,

MarcoFalke,2020-06-11 16:49:19,"ACK, checked that the base58 import is removed from key.py. Still no opinion on whether base58 should be its own module, but the diff here has minimal risk of breaking anything. With two ACKs without commit hash (presumably Concept ACKS?), this seems good to merge.\n\nACK 3a83a01694160f2e722e1bc90a328bd569b8e109 🍪\n\ngit diff e38081846d889fcbbbc6ca4a4d3bca26807fde2f~2 e38081846d889fcbbbc6ca4a4",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19239#issuecomment-642804163,642804163,
jnewbery,2020-06-11 17:22:43,"> I don't understand what the problem is with base58 being its own module\n\nNo problem, but I think ideally base58, bech32 and higher abstract level address functionality could all exist in the same module with no issues. base58 is used almost nowhere apart from addresses (wallet import format is the one exception I can think of) and similarly for bech32. There's already confusion between the d",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19239#issuecomment-642822740,642822740,
MarcoFalke,2020-06-11 17:37:55,"Generally, as long as we don't have a guideline of how the test framework classes should be structured into modules, I consider the specifics to be of stylistic nature.
