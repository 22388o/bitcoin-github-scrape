Michagogo,2014-12-26T10:25:37Z,"Why are you removing the ""check out the version you want to build"" step? That is correct, you always want to do the build with the version of the descriptors that's in the tag you're building.\n\nAnd the file names that you changed down at the bottom, as of 0.10, are still wrong.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5543#issuecomment-68134819,68134819,
fanquake,2014-12-26T10:31:53Z,"The ""check out the version"" step makes no sense in this guide, because you never define VERSION anywhere beforehand. It's not until you follow the steps under ""perform gitian builds"" in release-process.md and export VERSION=x.y.z that it actually makes sense to do.\n\nAs for the file names, I meant to include that they aren't quite correct yet. Looking for suggestions as to what we should do there",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5543#issuecomment-68135000,68135000,
