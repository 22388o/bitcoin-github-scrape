laanwj,2020-06-29 16:26:40,"Something I've noticed when using out-of-tree builds is that the test logs end up in the source directory, not the build directory. Does this fix that?\n\nEdit: It seems so:\n- Before, the test logs ended up in `src/test/*.log` and `src/wallet/test/*.log`.\n- With this PR, they only end up in `build/src/test/*.log`. There is no seperate directory for the wallet test logs  anymore\n\nI think ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19385#issuecomment-651226882,651226882,

Both bitcoin and the wallet tests are added to `BITCOIN_TESTS`, and since the commit I made throws away the preceding path, they both end up in the same place.  Seems like it would be better to have `BITCOIN_TESTS` and `BITCOIN_WALLET_TESTS` handled ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19385#issuecomment-651261124,651261124,
