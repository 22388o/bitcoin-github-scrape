NicolasDorier,2017-03-12T02:41:21Z,"Unsolveable P2PKH watch-only is already possible but you need to import the public key.\nAlso, your ShouldVerifySig is not needed, DummySignatureCreator already bypass the sig.\n\nThe reason you got unsolvable is because the wallet does not know the pubkey of the p2pkh.\n\nI think the current behavior make sense.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9965#issuecomment-285917247,285917247,
sipa,2017-03-12T04:41:36Z,"I'm not sure this is a good idea. If you want it to be solvable, you need to import the public key. Without it, you don't know whether the public key is compressed or not, so you can't actually accurately estimate the input size, so it's unsolvable for a reason.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9965#issuecomment-285921982,285921982,
jonasschnelli,2017-03-26T19:07:43Z,Thanks @sipa. I kinda falsely ignored the fact that the pubkey could be uncompressed. Your right. Closing.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9965#issuecomment-289306992,289306992,
TheBlueMatt,2017-03-10T22:10:53Z,Is this neccessary? it looks like the Checker here should just always return true if its the DummySignatureChecker from the DummySignatureCreator passed in by IsMine().,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9965#discussion_r105499801,105499801,src/script/sign.cpp
NicolasDorier,2017-03-12T02:43:03Z,"Not necessary, the DummySignatureCreator already bypass signature checking.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9965#discussion_r105547381,105547381,src/script/sign.cpp
