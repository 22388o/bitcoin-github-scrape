jnewbery,2017-04-17T21:28:34Z,"@jimmysong thanks for opening this. I like the concept, but I wonder whether the approach is over-fitted:\n\n- it's difficult to benchmark what the 'expected time' is for these tests. They're dependent on a lot of factors, including i/o, what else is happening on the system, and so on. If someone writes a new test, how do they know how to set the time?\n- if someone updates/modifies a test case",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10219#issuecomment-294598621,294598621,
jimmysong,2017-04-17T21:47:02Z,"@jnewbery \n\n* My thought on the benchmark was that people can see roughly what percentage of the expected time they take for a given test roughly in the same range on their own machine and divide by that amount. It does seem that developers currently have the same burden since they have to place their test roughly in the right place on the respective lists.\n* Good point on the updates/modifi",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10219#issuecomment-294604027,294604027,
MarcoFalke,2017-04-17T21:55:13Z,"Indeed, the requirement is only that the longest test don't come last in the list. For all the quick tests it is not really important. I think the current approach/ordering is sufficient.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10219#issuecomment-294605681,294605681,
jnewbery,2017-04-17T22:08:13Z,"@jimmysong I'd go for zipping the lists together rather than concatenating them. When running extended tests, the fact that pruning isn't started immediately is a a big loss. If we can fix that with a one-line change, let's go ahead and do it.\n\nLet's stick to the _SCRIPTS naming convention.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10219#issuecomment-294608383,294608383,
jimmysong,2017-04-17T22:24:38Z,"@jnewbery @MarcoFalke \n\nI wanted to do the minimal change to get what we wanted and I just placed the EXTENDED_SCRIPTS first. Just wanting your thoughts on this. If you don't like it, I'll change this to zipping them per @jnewbery's branch.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10219#issuecomment-294612796,294612796,

How about with zipping the two lists together?\n\nutACK 637706dc9ea9244954252a4fd7d8786bf93e3b67.
