    "body": "> Given that there are four _valid_ states but eight possible combinations (see @amitiuttarwar's [summarization](https://bitcoincore.reviews/18113.html#appendix)), one option is to refactor the code to use an enum with four variants named appropriately. This removes the possibility of getting into an invalid states. However, I'm not sure how practical this refactor would be or how difficult it would be to come up with meaningful names.\r\n\r\ninteresting idea but then I think renaming the flags to `NEWCOIN` and `MUSTFLUSH` as suggest by @jnewbery is a more practical change.",
