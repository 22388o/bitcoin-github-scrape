laanwj,2019-11-26 09:46:29,"Ok, thanks for explaining.\n\nThe way MacOS does things is really confusing here. So we need to remove the functionality because the calls are deprecated, but they still work fine, even on newer MacOS, if compiled with an older MacOS in mind.\n\n> Note that there are plenty of ways for the user to create the ""start at login"" behaviour without us providing an option from within Bitcoin Core.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17567#discussion_r350634311,350634311,doc/release-notes.md
