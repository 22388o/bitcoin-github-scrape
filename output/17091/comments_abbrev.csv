laanwj,2019-10-10 09:18:15,"Do you really need the `shell=True` here? The immediate problem is that the arguments aren't escaped, so this won't work with paths with spaces, or other characters in it. You could escape the args with `shlex.quote`, but in general, it's better to avoid the shell completely and use Python's stdin/stdout/stderr redirection.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17091#discussion_r333413682,333413682,test/functional/feature_loadblock.py

In a normal case I would have used Pythons output redirect but I wanted to simulate the use of the scripts exactly as described in the script's README. I guess one way to get rid of it would be to extend `linearize-hashes.py` to take an output parameter like `lineari,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17091#discussion_r333511366,333511366,test/functional/feature_loadblock.py
