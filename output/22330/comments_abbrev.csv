You are right, in total we only need two blocks to scan -- in the second commit one UTXO in MiniWallet to start with is enough (both sub-tests `test_no_inherited_signaling` and `test_replacement_relay_fee` consume one UTXO, but also create one, due to calls to `send_self_transfer`), in the latest commit, we have to increase it to two, however ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22330#issuecomment-886074550,886074550,
