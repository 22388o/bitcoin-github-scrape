luke-jr,2016-07-08T14:19:18Z,I think this conflicts with key origin which is for better or worse being used in the wild.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8205#issuecomment-231371796,231371796,

paveljanik,2016-06-15T08:16:09Z,Can you please fix the comment above? You are sending 11 BTC but the comment says 21 BTC.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8205#discussion_r67117845,67117845,qa/rpc-tests/wallet.py
jonasschnelli,2016-06-15T08:17:05Z,Fixed.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8205#discussion_r67117963,67117963,qa/rpc-tests/wallet.py
MarcoFalke,2016-06-15T09:18:38Z,"Not sure about this one but I feel we could create a fresh rpc-test/hd-wallet.py or wallet-hd.py, as I expect the hd functionality will be extended further.\n\nIn the future it would be easier to extend the hd test if it was a separate file and we wouldn't need to fiddle with the already bloated wallet.py\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8205#discussion_r67126764,67126764,qa/rpc-tests/wallet.py
jonasschnelli,2016-06-15T09:21:01Z,"Yes. As soon as we have an bip32 import function (start a wallet with given xpriv) this makes sense. Without that, it's hard to cover the new hd features in tests. For this little change I guess it would be an overkill to start the a new test-script.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8205#discussion_r67127138,67127138,qa/rpc-tests/wallet.py
MarcoFalke,2016-07-06T18:21:06Z,"I think it is wrong to use `wallet.py` to test HD behavior. Instead, we should set `-usehd=0` for the wallet tests and create a separate file for HD test. Otherwise, the legacy wallet is completely untested.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8205#discussion_r69783927,69783927,qa/rpc-tests/wallet.py
MarcoFalke,2016-07-06T18:21:46Z,Please rebase on #8309 when merged and move this check over to the other test script.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8205#discussion_r69784044,69784044,qa/rpc-tests/wallet.py
