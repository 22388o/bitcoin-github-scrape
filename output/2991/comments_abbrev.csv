Diapolo,2013-09-28T13:33:06Z,"@laanwj This should be looked at before the next translations update, so as you seem to be active today you can perhaps review it :).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2991#issuecomment-25298188,25298188,
laanwj,2013-09-29T07:18:13Z,Why go that far to remove the %1's from the translation strings? Having them in the translation string gives translators more flexibility where in the translation to put the values. In some languages with other word orderings that may be useful. Breaking up the strings means that translators get to translate a lot of small nondescript fragments.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2991#issuecomment-25315718,25315718,
Diapolo,2013-09-29T10:26:53Z,I reverted the changes for `Total Amount %1` and `Invalid payment address %1`.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2991#issuecomment-25317918,25317918,
Diapolo,2013-10-01T13:35:44Z,"Updated, so we now have a `tr(""%1 to %2"")` instead of different translatable strings for sendcoins.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2991#issuecomment-25448971,25448971,
Diapolo,2013-10-01T13:51:48Z,Updated to use monospace for addresses and remove the fixed font-size.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2991#issuecomment-25450695,25450695,
sipa,2013-09-13T15:06:05Z,In other languages it is not necessarily possible to break the string up like this.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2991#discussion_r6349820,6349820,src/qt/sendcoinsdialog.cpp
Diapolo,2013-09-14T07:15:28Z,"@sipa I can rework this, if you want?\n\nEdit: I'm going to rework it, found some other things that are worth to get changed also :).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2991#discussion_r6363290,6363290,src/qt/sendcoinsdialog.cpp
Diapolo,2013-09-29T10:08:55Z,"@laanwj I would love to keep this new code, as I really dislike HTML in translation strings and that way it's much cleaner.\nAnyway I'm fine with reverting the other two changes `Total Amount %1` and `Invalid payment address %1`.\nDoes this make you ACK this pull?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2991#discussion_r6646785,6646785,src/qt/sendcoinsdialog.cpp

laanwj,2013-09-29T10:37:09Z,"If you want to get rid of the HTML, I'd prefer something like\n\n```\nformatted.append(tr(""%1 to %2"").arg(""<b>""+format(amount)+""</b>"", merchant));\n```\n\nThis factors out the html without getting rid of the context in the translation string.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2991#discussion_r6646841,6646841,src/qt/sendcoinsdialog.cpp
Diapolo,2013-09-29T10:37:55Z,Will revert...\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2991#discussion_r6646843,6646843,src/qt/sendcoinsentry.cpp
Diapolo,2013-09-29T10:41:23Z,"Indeed, this makes it a nice translation string without HTML ;).\n\nEdit: But think of it in this context we would have 2 translatable strings, `to` and `%1 to %2`, whereas this patch makes it just `to`. Still I like your hint for avoiding HTML, just not sure if it makes sense here...\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2991#discussion_r6646848,6646848,src/qt/sendcoinsdialog.cpp
laanwj,2013-09-30T08:02:54Z,"Wouldn't it be possible to use tr(""%1 to %2"") in both cases? That'd get rid of a separate words like ""to"" as translation string.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2991#discussion_r6651655,6651655,src/qt/sendcoinsdialog.cpp
Diapolo,2013-10-01T08:55:16Z,"Even better, I'll take a look...\n\nEdit: `formatted.append(tr(""%1 to %2"").arg(""<b>""+format(amount)+""</b>"", merchant));` causes an error, format was not declared in this scope?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2991#discussion_r6681140,6681140,src/qt/sendcoinsdialog.cpp
