freewil,2012-08-28T13:13:49Z,LGTM but you should rebase so there isnt 5 commits\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1735#issuecomment-8090850,8090850,
gmaxwell,2012-08-28T17:59:18Z,"Indeed, this doesn't need three commits and two merges.\n\nDoes this actually result in different code? The loops have no real side effects, I don't know how terribly the boost foreach is, but it's not inconceivable to me that the compiler could already do this with these loops because they're simple single assignment. \n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1735#issuecomment-8100893,8100893,

gavinandresen,2012-08-29T17:59:08Z,"I don't like these kind of obsessive-compulsive source code changes, I think they're a waste of time.\n\nIf you're rewriting old code for some reason, then feel free to clean it up. Otherwise I think it is better left alone.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1735#issuecomment-8134916,8134916,
jgarzik,2012-08-29T18:05:42Z,"Agree that it does smell like premature optimization, with zero proof of actual need or benefit\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1735#issuecomment-8135138,8135138,
xanatos,2012-08-29T18:42:39Z,"The objective isn't only a (probably null) optimization. I see it as ""let's make it clear what is the meaning of the code"". Is it ""looking for at least one element with a condition"" or is it ""using an hidden side-effect of enumerating the collection/checking the condition""? The first time I watched the code I asked myself: why isn't it breaking if it is only looking for a single value?\n\nFor the ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1735#issuecomment-8136431,8136431,

jgarzik,2012-09-04T15:58:30Z,"It's still adding source code and binary code size without much benefit.  We definitely appreciate people reading the source codebase this closely, though!
