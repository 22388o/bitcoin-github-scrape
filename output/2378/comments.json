    "body": "@gavinandresen @sipa @laanwj and other core devs:\nI dislike the fact that we release versions with unfinished translations, IMHO our release process should cover these things much better. I'd like to vote for a central place where a release schedule is maintained, so that I can sync these translation update pulls with them. If we want our client to become (even more) widely accepted, we should at least cover 100% of the \"main\" supported languages. We should even consider to drop translations below a certain percentage of completeness.\n\nI'm fine with emergency releases, that need to get out the sooner the better, but even 0.8 didn't have full german translation coverage for example.\n",
