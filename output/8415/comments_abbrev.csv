laanwj,2016-07-28T07:53:57Z,"I think there is a slight misunderstanding here. There are two different cases:\n\n1) Want to be able to connect to `.onion` peers, but normal IPv4/IPv6 connections go through plainnet\n2) Want to be able to connect to `.onion` peers only\n\nYou change this from (1) to (2), but both are valid use cases, and I think if you make this change you should describe both.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8415#discussion_r72578429,72578429,doc/tor.md
laanwj,2016-07-28T08:03:31Z,"Also for (2) I personally prefer:\n\n```\n./bitcoin -proxy=127.0.0.1:9050 -externalip=57qr3yd1nyntf5k.onion -discover -listen -onlynet=onion -bind=127.0.0.1\n```\n\nThis has the same effect, but in the case that there is a bug causing bitcoind to ignore `onlynet` and try to connect to IPv4/IPv6 anyway, at least it will go through Tor.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8415#discussion_r72579649,72579649,doc/tor.md
