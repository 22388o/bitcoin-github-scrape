emilengler,2019-12-27 21:09:51,"> On Linux, any type of pointer may be passed as a void* argument. As such, this platform-specific typedef switch is unnecessary.\n\nWhat do you define as platform here? The OS or the compiler?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17807#issuecomment-569346098,569346098,

If I happen to be mistaken, then the line of code linked to in the description is broken and should use the typedef instead.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17807#issuecomment-569346487,569346487,
ahook,2019-12-28 03:57:35,"Valid argument. I tend to lean towards code reduction/simplification, but if the consensus is that the documentary aspect of the compat typedefs is more valuable than the LoC reduction, I'm happy to revert. In that case I'd instead like to replace the couple setsockopt uses that still use void*/char* directly with the typedefs, for consistency.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17807#issuecomment-569382542,569382542,
