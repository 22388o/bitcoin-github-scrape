emilengler,2019-11-05 13:20:32,Wouldn't it be better to create a file for this in the `doc` folder and link to it in the README?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17365#issuecomment-549819641,549819641,
icota,2019-11-05 13:43:44,I don't think so. This is specific to depends and other platform cross-compilation instructions are in the same file.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17365#issuecomment-549827919,549827919,

Sjors,2019-11-05 15:31:34,Future note: please don't tag Github usernames in commit messages; it results in spam when altcoins backport it. My own fault for missing that :-),https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17365#issuecomment-549874423,549874423,
icota,2019-11-06 08:16:02,"You didn't miss anything. :smile: \n\nI read `CONTRIBUTING` like a good boy so I didn't include it in any commit messages. Merge commit picked it up from the first comment though. Should we avoid that?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17365#issuecomment-550196870,550196870,
Sjors,2019-11-06 08:58:23,"No, I think the merge script should take care of that. I thought it stripped the `@`. @MarcoFalke?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17365#issuecomment-550211798,550211798,
laanwj,2019-11-06 09:47:28,"No, it doesn't strip themâ€”as this might corrupt, say, mail addresses, github's parsing is pretty ambigious and heuristic-based and replicating this is non-trivial!\nit warns when there are any before merging, though",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17365#issuecomment-550231394,550231394,
laanwj,2019-11-04 16:49:15,Maybe make this information for Android a separate section (but refer to it here),https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17365#discussion_r342154391,342154391,depends/README.md
