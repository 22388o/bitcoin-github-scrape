jgarzik,2012-03-21T13:25:08Z,"Interesting.  I guess the large cache helps with all the lookups needed to validate each block.  Because we are looking up random hashes, there is likely zero cache locality from one lookup to the next.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/964#issuecomment-4617109,4617109,
