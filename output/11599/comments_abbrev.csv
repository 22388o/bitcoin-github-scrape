ryanofsky,2017-11-03T14:56:03Z,">Concept ACK.\n>\n>Drop C prefix too?\n\nThanks, will wait for more feedback. I didn't rename CCriticalSection because it's used everywhere and changing it would make the diff 3 times as big (22 lines -> 73 lines). Also I think we will probably lean toward using non-recursive rather than recursive locks in new code, so CCriticalSection name should not matter as much going forward. I kept the C",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11599#issuecomment-341726973,341726973,

TheBlueMatt,2017-11-03T21:21:20Z,"To me, calling it just ""Mutex""/""Lock"" implies this is what people should use for new mutexs/locks, but that isn't what we want because it doesn't support DEBUG_LOCKORDER. Indeed, we maybe could make it support DEBUG_LOCKORDER and then start migrating to it over our current recursive stuff, but for now I'd prefer to make it more clear that the new typedefs should be discouraged.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11599#issuecomment-341830439,341830439,
