laanwj,2013-03-18T06:01:50Z,That link says that _FORTIFY_SOURCE is a glibc feature; and glibc library is only used on Linux.\n\nSo this is pretty much a no-op.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2376#issuecomment-15040487,15040487,

gavinandresen,2013-03-18T23:35:27Z,"gcc header files on my mac do have #if _FORTIFY_SOURCE .... so it is gcc, I think, not just gcc on Linux.\n\nSo ACK from me on pullling this; an extra #define won't hurt if you're compiling with something other than gcc. Would be nice to add a comment explaining that _FORTIFY_SOURCE is a gcc-compiler-specific thing so we don't have this discussion again.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2376#issuecomment-15089054,15089054,
