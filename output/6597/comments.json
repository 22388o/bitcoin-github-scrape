    "body": "Rebased and simplified. Looking at it again, @dcousens was right that many of the changes would have affected performance negatively. Besides they were (or at least they currently seem to be) unnecessary for #6382 (or for facilitating the creating of testchains in general by not requiring tester to \"mine\" the genesis block of their testchains: the genesis block is correct by definition).\nNow it should be clear that we're just optimizing the genesis block case in ConnectBlock() without adding any work to the other cases, and we're only affecting negatively the performance of CBlockTreeDB::LoadBlockIndexGuts by comparing two hashes right before returning and error (only if CheckProofOfWork had previously failed), which I think is very acceptable.\nSo I don't think benchmarking this makes sense anymore.\n",

    "body": "Mhmm, why #6382 seems to be working just fine with reindex then? Have you actually reproduced the error you claim would appear?\n\nThis shouldn't be necessary, certainly not in CheckBlockHeader(). In AcceptBlockHeader, it won't be called for the genesis block, see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/main.cpp#L3071\nMaybe it is required on TestBlockValidity() or something else that calls CheckBlock() (which calls CheckBlockHeader()), but I would prefer to leave the genesis block check out of the consensus function CheckBlockHeader().\n\nProbably a good test for this would be to create a new regtest-like chain with a genesis block that doesn't satisfy the proof of work and run it for a few blocks both with and without reindex from the python tests. But without #6907 and something like https://github.com/jtimon/bitcoin/commit/98923c381eca9874f135f08297218f3f8fff5221 it seems like the testing would be much more than the change itself.\n",

However, if you actually try with an\ninvalid genesis block, reindex fails.\n\nTechnically not a concern for Bitcoin at this point, so this is not a\nblocker for merge. Just some advice that if we'd actually want to start\ncreating invalid genesis blocks (which makes creating test chains much\neasier), this patch isn't enough.\n",

    "body": "Genesis blocks are valid by definition and should never be checked (whether they pass pow or not). \nIn any case, IIRC last time I tested #6382 it worked just fine even when reindexing the chain, therefore I disagree with sipa that this patch isn't enough. As said the very fact that we disagree on whether or not this is enough for its stated goal, means IMO that this should be introduced with  tests that verify this is enough and will keep being enough in the future (make sure nobody undoes this without noticing).\nI believe the best way to test this is through a new chain whose genesis block doesn't  pass pow (regtest2 ?) And test boh with and without reindex.\n\nDoes that make sense?\n\nAddionally, I don't  plan to create a new chain without #6907 (and generic selection with -chain, also part of #6382 ),and that's  why I'm  closing this for now.\nAnyone feel free to take over this if you can't  wait for the factory. I've  personally been wanting this factory for almost two years, I can wait more for #6907 to be merged (was supposed to happen before forking 0.12, I really hope it will happen before forking 0.13.\n",

Even for mainchain, Satoshi didn't need to mine the genesis block because it is correct by definition (or more accurately, it is part of the definition of how valid chains must be). Just in the same way, he could have decided to make the genesis subsidy spendable but he didn't (but changing that now would be a hardfork). The creator of the system worked in mysterious ways...\n",
