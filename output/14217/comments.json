I'm not sure what our established policy is here, but maybe something like:\r\n```markdown\r\n* All changes should have accompanying unit tests (see `src/test/`) or functional tests (see `test/`). \r\n  PR authors should note which tests cover modified code. If no tests exist for a region of \r\n  modified code, new tests should accompany the change.\r\n```",
