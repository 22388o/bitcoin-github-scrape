    "body": "Since it's just a relay rule at worst you just reject transactions with NOP2 from the mempool - the default behaviour - pick a new NOP#, and try out the new behaviour. \n\nThis means the implementation either does one or the other version - nice and clean - and neither version will interfere with the other. Of course both NOPs will make it into blocks, but that's not going to do us any harm as neither side has applied a soft-forking rule.\n\nNow in many cases you don't need to do all this. For instance if we were to decide to make CLTV act against the block height/time rather than the tx one nodes with the old rule just reject txs from the less permissive version. You'd want to be careful re: DoS ban code, but we're finding that crops up over and over again anyway...\n\nOn 25 December 2014 17:25:58 GMT-05:00, Gregory Maxwell notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> @petertodd Say the relay rule were widely deployed.

Merging this for v0.11 would at least get 95% of the code in the release, with actual enforcement happening in a v0.11.1 release. Getting off the rebase treadmill would also be nice.\n\nWhile there has been discussion about a relative CLTV by @TheBlueMatt and @jtimon I don't think any of it really impacts implementation of an absolute CLTV, which is also needed. My most recent proposal is that absolute CLTV be implemented as-is, and relative CLTV be left for a future scripting system rethinking: http://www.mail-archive.com/bitcoin-development@lists.sourceforge.net/msg07418.html\n",

    "body": "What I mean is that you just changed the CLTV by requiring 1 OP_NOP2 for doing it.\nYou did it for NOP scarcity reason, and (not a big deal though), it broke the simpler code before.\n\nThe rational for adding the PUSH 1, was permitting new mode and implementation for CLTV in the future without wasting other NOP.\n\nMy point is that NOP scarcity is not a problem worth considering. \n\nBecause the day we use all nops except NOP10, we can just say that \"NOP10\" is a \"OP_EXT\" operation. And then consider \"1 OP_EXT\" like a \"NOP11\", and \"2 OP_EXT\" like a \"NOP12\".\n\nSo I see no problem with using NOP3 for RCLTV or other mode we might invent in the future.\n",

The reason I believe it is valuable to include the type parameter is for possible type checking efficiencies and future-proofing if the convention is adopted that OP_NOP(n) has the format [n n-1 ... 3 2 aux OP_NOPn] where the first parameter is the auxiliary opcode. So OP_NOP1 is used for opcodes which take no parameters [aux OP_NOP1]; OP_NOP2 for those like CLTV and RCLTV which take a single parameter [x aux OP_NOP2]; OP_NOP3 for those which take two parameters [y x aux OP_NOP3]; etc.\n\nThe implementation becomes a little bit cleaner as the OP_NOP(n) case statement can check that sufficient number of parameters are on the stack for all of its auxiliary opcodes, and future script authoring tools can have some rudimentary future-proof stack bounds checking.\n\nI am strongly in favor of including the type parameter.\n",

On the other hand, there may be future extensions to script which we want the use of an unallocated NOP in scriptPubKeys, I'd much rather take the hit of an extra byte in the scriptSig for CLTV/RCLTV than the UTXO if find later that we've exhausted the NOP space.\n",

    "body": "Make OP_NOP2 fail unless there are at least two items on the stack. It doesn't care what items, but they must be >=2. At this point a script tool, or relay policy is written that has no idea what the extra OP_NOP2 functionality is, but it knows that at the point OP_NOP2 is executed, there must be two items on the stack. A script compiler or transaction validator throws an error if it can determine that the stack would contain less than two items when the OP_NOP2 is executed. For some scriptPubKeys, the minimum number of pushes in the scriptSig could be inferred based on this and other constraints.\n\nLater, CLTV is implemented but none of this software has been updated to understand the new rules yet. Nevertheless, the compiler still throws an error when the lock time parameter is not provided, relay nodes drop the same transactions, and your script type checker helpfully reminds you that you are probably missing a value for that unrecognised OP_NOP2 extended instruction.\n\nIt's a very limited form of type checking, and not nearly as useful as it could be in a much better designed language. But it is an improvement over the status quo for existing script.\n",

    "body": "@maaku Relay nodes already drop transactions that use unknown opcodes; in fact I should have done that for this type patch... shows it's an ill-advised idea IMO - yet another thing to take into account over the simpler \"one-opcode one-function\" principle.\n\nAgain, I'm just not seeing the value of things like \"type checkers\" for the scripting language right now, given how utterly simple it is. Equally, in the future if the choice was to make the scripting language more or less complex for the sake of _type checking_ vs. getting consensus, I'd 100% choose the latter, always. People are free to write scripts that are bad ideas; the important thing is that the consensus critical codebase stay simple to ensure we don't make mistakes that affect everyone.

    "body": "I'm not sure that's any less confusing.\n\nThe key concept to understand is that CLTV only checks the transaction's nLockTime field, not the actual block height or time. Thus anything that disables nLockTime's effect can bypass CLTV.\n\nIncidentally I think part of the confusion is how the SignatureChecker object separates the logic of CLTV into two completely disjoint parts for no clear reason. It's a lot more clear when all this logic is in one place. A better refactoring would be to encapsulate the execution state, and if needed, cache expensive operations on that state like hashing the transaction. This is especially clear when you consider future improvements like opcodes to sign something other than the txin prevout.\n\nOn 17 December 2014 10:04:40 GMT-05:00, SergioDemianLerner notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> > -        (txTo.nLockTime <  LOCKTIME_THRESHOLD && nLockTime < \n> >   LOCKTIME_THRESHOLD) ||\n> > -        (txTo.nLockTime >= LOCKTIME_THRESHOLD && nLockTime >=\n> >   LOCKTIME_THRESHOLD)\n> > -    ))\n> > -        return false;\n> >   +\n> > -    // Now that we know we're comparing apples-to-apples, the\n> > -    // comparison is a simple numeric one.\n> > -    if (nLockTime > (int64_t)txTo.nLockTime)\n> > -        return false;\n> >   +\n> > -    // Finally the nLockTime feature can be disabled and thus\n> > -    // CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY bypassed if every txin has been\n> > -    // finalized by setting nSequence to maxint.

Better to stick to the same, well-tested, mechanism everything else uses; making it an inline function now risks having to change it again anyway.\n\nre: the softfork mechanism, I'm well aware of it, and have been reviewing it myself. The idea here is just to get all _but_ the actual softfork into a release to make network-wide testing of the new functionality easy. In the unlikely event that the functionality has to change this gives us one last chance to do so prior to the actual soft-fork.\n",

Your argument sounds like \"let's just dump the trash in the floor of the kitchen because the rest of the house is also dirty\".\nI don't understand why having ugly code should preclude us from written the new stuff in a cleaner way, it will be less work and smaller diffs in future cleanups.\n\n> same, **well-tested**, mechanism everything else uses\n\nThis would be equally well tested since the build would be identical. That's the main reason to make the function inlined (one could also argue about performance but I'm pretty sure the compiler is smart enough to \"think that by itself\").\n\nI insist this is a nit and shouldn't be a blocker: \"I'm too lazy to do that now. You should have asked before, too late, it will be more work for you or someone else later\" would be a perfectly valid answer.\n\nOn #5153 in general, It's sad that the interpreter of other implementations (like libbitcoin's) is much more readable than libconsensus'...\nBut it's worse than people not only don't want to implement it but actively oppose to that kind of obvious, trivial and completely safe imprevements.\nThis also applies to a subset of #4646 and any other huge nesting we have.\nYears of experience in software engineering show that it is a bad practice that leads to less readable and thus less maintainable code. That's why tools like checkstyle exist.\n\nBut, anyway, it's not worth it to discuss this further in here. Do the more-readable-but-equivalent-build-fixup commit or don't. It's completely up to you.\nNobody coded the identical-build-check tool that I proposed and you created a bounty for, so actually checking that the build is identical will be more work than making the inline function.\n",

I'd give the analogy of a factory that produces drums of arsenic as a byproduct, which currently get dumped in a big pile out the back. You'd be better off continuing to put it all in the one big pile, rather than deciding \"Ah, we're pretty sure we're going to dump it in the river in the future, arsenic doesn't bioaccumulate so the dilution will fix the problem. So stick all new drums in the river.\" - If it turns out that plan was a bad idea, now you have to clean up both a backyard and a river - twice as much work to plan the cleanup! Better having a problem with exactly one solution that can be repeatedly mechanically to fix it.\n",
