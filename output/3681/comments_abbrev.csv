If we are in a chain of unconfirmed transactions (so the parent is not malleated, but the parent-parent)\nreissue also fails.\nNot sure if big merchants can set -spendzeroconfchange because they have to send a lot of transactions, the wallet could run out of funds too quickly, if set.\nI am just concerned ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3681#issuecomment-35246953,35246953,

No way to test this or at least all corner cases.\n\nHadn't thought about it that it would be possible for the parent variant to already be spent. I thought this would be a relatively way to avoid having to mess with vfSpent and still make it possible to unstuck transactions. \n\nBut if it still amounts to thousands of lines of code, let's forget about it. -",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3681#issuecomment-35247540,35247540,
