MarcoFalke,2021-07-18 07:15:33,"> By the way, any reason we don't --enable-werror by default? Being on the cautious side would seem to be a more sane default to me.\n\nThere might be unknown warnings in future releases of compilers that we are not aware of. Also, compilers might produce false warnings if they have bugs.
