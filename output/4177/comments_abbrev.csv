laanwj,2014-05-19T13:06:55Z,"Paranoid is good.\n\nMaybe add it as an option first for now before we enable it in general? What is the biggest risk here, to have false positives with regard to corruption?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4177#issuecomment-43499450,43499450,
sipa,2014-05-21T21:24:13Z,"Basically, yes. The fix in 1.16 is a case of something that LevelDB would consider corruption in paranoid mode, but is both hard to avoid (machines do crash...) and harmless (logfiles are append-only anyway). Perhaps there are other cases like these.\n\nOn the other hand, I prefer detecting corruption as early as possible...\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4177#issuecomment-43816070,43816070,

laanwj,2014-07-11T13:42:16Z,I've tested this for almost a month on some nodes. No spurious corruption errors. ACK.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4177#issuecomment-48731309,48731309,
