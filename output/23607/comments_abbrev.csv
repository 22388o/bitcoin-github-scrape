Perlover,2021-11-26 23:48:47,@hebasto I used the master branch of libevent so this commit definitely merged. I am not sure about new releases of libevent with this commit.

I compiled the bitcoind too with these patches.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23607#issuecomment-980469550,980469550,
