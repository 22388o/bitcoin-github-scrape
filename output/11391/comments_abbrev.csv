Or does everyone else manually run the builds/write their own script like I have up til this point?\n\nYes, it's my script and there was a reason for those two lines there (it fixed some problems for me in the past). Removing those two lines doesn't effect my setup now (for some reason) so it should be fine to remove them.\n\nEdit: Actually rem",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11391#issuecomment-331682352,331682352,
meshcollider,2017-09-24T04:52:02Z,Hmm how did you set up that bridge? It's not mentioned in any docs so maybe it's them that need amending not this. Do you also have a br0 bridge (the one configured here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/gitian-building.md#setting-up-debian-for-gitian-building)? Or just lxcbr0?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11391#issuecomment-331687086,331687086,
achow101,2017-09-25T19:14:04Z,I don't remember how that was all actually setup; I did it years ago. I believe it may be the same thing as the br0 setup in the gitian building guide but my setup probably had some weirdness to it or had br0 already taken by something else. I believe that it may have also been that lxc was defaulting to using lxcbr0 for me instead of br0. I'm not sure.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11391#issuecomment-331983277,331983277,
meshcollider,2017-09-27T00:58:20Z,"I think it makes more sense to have the script consistent with the VM set up in the docs, so it'd be good if at least one other person (ping @kallewoof ?) could confirm this fixes it like it does for me",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11391#issuecomment-332377735,332377735,
kallewoof,2017-09-27T01:07:59Z,"Sorry for lack of response. I actually gave up trying to get this all to work as there are a few too many assumptions that I can't guess correctly. I believe the fix you suggest enables the --setup call. Even without this change I am able to run the --build variant, but I have no idea if the results are actually valid as I haven't verified or signed anything yet.

achow101,2017-11-04T15:54:35Z,@Sjors You can and should just copy the script out of the folder where you have the bitcoin source and use it from outside of that. There you can make any modifications that you want to it without said modifications being effected by the git tree changing.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11391#issuecomment-341907737,341907737,
