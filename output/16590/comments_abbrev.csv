laanwj,2019-08-14 12:08:27,"~0\n\nThis completely depends on what the install prefix on `./configure` is set to.\n\nIf you want to get really pedantic about this, you could make a `contrib/init/bitcoind.service.in` that the autobuild system replaces the `@prefix@` in to make the eventual service file.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16590#issuecomment-521219326,521219326,
emilengler,2019-08-14 18:03:58,@laanwj Good idea but what is with the other init systems? Also I think all the scripts we provide should work out of the box,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16590#issuecomment-521354539,521354539,
dongcarl,2019-08-14 18:13:13,@emilengler I believe the same treatment should be applied to all init systems. The `/usr/local` default for `PREFIX` comes from autoconf: https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/manual/autoconf-2.69/html_node/Default-Prefix.html,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16590#issuecomment-521357692,521357692,
emilengler,2019-08-15 15:36:17,"@dongcarl Ok, will do another pull request with more autoconf.\nThis will be closed in favor of the future one",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16590#issuecomment-521686422,521686422,
