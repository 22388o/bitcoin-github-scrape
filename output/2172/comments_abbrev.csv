Diapolo,2013-01-13T20:24:21Z,Updated to use just `block database` (instead block/coin database) to be better understandable for our users.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2172#issuecomment-12199528,12199528,

laanwj,2013-01-13T09:47:45Z,"What about ""Error loading block index"" (that's what the code says at least)?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2172#discussion_r2628776,2628776,src/init.cpp
Diapolo,2013-01-13T09:51:10Z,We had that error message you mention before and IMO it was too generic. I guess that is why @sipa chose block/coin DB.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2172#discussion_r2628782,2628782,src/init.cpp

sipa,2013-01-13T17:03:42Z,"It's technically two databases, and the problem may be in either or the combination of them. But being correct is probably more confusing and less useful for users. Perhaps we should simply use ""block database"".\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2172#discussion_r2629341,2629341,src/init.cpp
Diapolo,2013-01-13T20:17:21Z,Good thing about just `block database` is it won't be larger than our splash screen ^^. I'll update this.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2172#discussion_r2629685,2629685,src/init.cpp
