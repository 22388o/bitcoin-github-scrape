petertodd,2014-04-01T14:06:39Z,"@ditto-b Could you please do up a test script that actually exercises this code? regtest mode has a shortened halving interval and a trivial PoW so creating the blocks and submitting them locally shouldn't be too hard. You can use https://github.com/petertodd/python-bitcoinlib/ if you know python - it has both the CBlock/CTransaction stuff to make the blocks, and easy access to the RPC interface.
