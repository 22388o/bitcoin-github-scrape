    "body": "@gmaxwell Thanks for reviewing and sorry for my misunderstanding.\n\nThe block header is still checked and all blocks claiming to be within the last 30 days would be fully validated. Wouldn't 30 days worth of blocks well cover that kind of issue because of the limits on valid block times? Which assumption would have to be violated for this to be a problem? Can the node not get a valid header chain? Can the node not get an \"accurate\" view of time?\n",
