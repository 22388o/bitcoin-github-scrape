tcatm,2011-09-29T16:25:06Z,"Now that midstate is deprecated I will rework this patch to as it does not need to support midstate anymore. Though, what is the most generic code for ByteSwap/Reverse that we can safely use in bitcoin and works on GCC (lin/win/osx) and VisualStudio?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/535#issuecomment-2239498,2239498,
gavinandresen,2011-09-29T17:48:04Z,"The generic byte-swap would be the code in the #else that uses rotlFixed...\n\nAlso, I think it'd be cleaner to move rotlFixed and the body of ByteReverse to util.cpp.\n\nCan you hold off on removing midstate support?  I'd like to pull this for the 0.5 release, we can remove the deprecated midstate a few months AFTER the 0.5 release (gotta give people time to adapt).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/535#issuecomment-2240981,2240981,
tcatm,2011-09-30T14:52:06Z,"Looks like github does not handle rebased pull requests correctly.\n\nChanges:\n- reduced `ByteReverse()` to a single function using shift, OR and AND\n\nWe can't move it to `util.cpp` because it is declared `inline` and it is used when looping over arrays so performance is still somewhat important.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/535#issuecomment-2250334,2250334,
