jnewbery,2017-05-08T13:46:16Z,"Added fixup commit:\n\n- replaces `persistmempool=false` with `-persistmempool=0`\n- reverts the `assert wait_until(lambda: len(self.nodes[1].getrawmempool()) == 0)` to `assert_equal(len(self.nodes[1].getrawmempool()), 0)`\n- adds a `sync_all()` call after `self.nodes[0].generate(1)` to ensure that we really are out of IBD.\n\nWill squash once this is ACKed and ready for merge.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10342#issuecomment-299871109,299871109,

sdaftuar,2017-05-05T16:51:26Z,"Does the `wait_until` accomplish anything here, or at line 80 below?  Either the mempool will be empty when this RPC is first invoked, in which case the wait_until will immediately return, or else it will have something -- in which case waiting and then failing later doesn't seem useful?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10342#discussion_r115041391,115041391,test/functional/mempool_persist.py
jnewbery,2017-05-05T17:09:18Z,"No - this could just as well be a straight assert that node1's mempool is empty. The `time.sleep(1)` above is what actually guarantees that we're not just hitting a window before node1's mempool fills up.\n\nI changed this to a `wait_until()` call for consistency with the line above, but could quite easily change it back if you think that would be clearer for the reader.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10342#discussion_r115044882,115044882,test/functional/mempool_persist.py

sdaftuar,2017-05-06T16:47:45Z,Yeah imo it would be clearer without the `wait_until`.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10342#discussion_r115124200,115124200,test/functional/mempool_persist.py
