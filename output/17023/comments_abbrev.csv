Sjors,2019-10-02 17:25:06,@sipa any thoughts on such a `multi67()` descriptor? It seems that at least Electrum and ColdCard use [BIP67](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0067.mediawiki) in the wild. It would be the same as `multi()` but at every index the public keys are ordered canonically.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17023#issuecomment-537596416,537596416,
