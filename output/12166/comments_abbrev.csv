ryanofsky,2018-01-15T16:14:08Z,"Attn @MeshCollider \n\n> it's slightly confusing that -walletdir relative paths are relative to the cwd\n\nThis is worse than confusing. This sounds like a mistake that should be fixed. Current working directory is helpful thing to rely on in scripts and command line tools, but long running apps and daemons should not depend on the current working directory. If a relative -walletdir path is sp",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12166#discussion_r161561520,161561520,doc/release-notes.md

jnewbery,2018-01-15T21:23:32Z,"I don't have a strong preference on how this works.
