This sounds like a mistake that should be fixed. Current working directory is helpful thing to rely on in scripts and command line tools, but long running apps and daemons should not depend on the current working directory. If a relative -walletdir path is specified in bitcoin.conf, it would be footgun for that directory to point to a completely different location if one day the user happens to be in a different directory when starting up bitcoin.\r\n\r\nI think a new PR should be opened to either forbid relative -walletdir paths, or interpret them stably relative to `<datadir>`.",
