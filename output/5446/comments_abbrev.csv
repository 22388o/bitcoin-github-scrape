laanwj,2014-12-10T07:03:18Z,"Neutral on this. A typedef is useful to make it possible to change the underlying implementation. Eg we did this for `CCoinsMap`, to easily be able to switch between std::map, boost::unordered_map, etc.\n\nMy comment would be on the name `CCoinsSet` - it is way too aspecific for a _wallet-specific_ type and clashes with `CCoinsMap` in that way.\n\nAnyhow, as said, I'm neutral on this, I don't thin",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5446#issuecomment-66412207,66412207,
