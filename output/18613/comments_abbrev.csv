MarcoFalke,2020-04-12 23:27:23,"Tests should be easy to write, and easy to read. Why can't this nonsensical operator on scripts be marked deleted in favour of self-documenting ones like `def push_data(self, vch)`, `def push_opcode(self, op)` or so? This way, script operations are easier to follow, but byte operations are not ruled out because (if needed) they can still be done by casting to bytes first.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18613#issuecomment-612691725,612691725,

MarcoFalke,2020-04-13 01:12:17,"I've replaced the implementation with `raise NotImplementedError` and only one test fails. So instead of changing the implementation and having reviewers go through that painful review, with the goal of keeping it around long term, doesn't seem ideal to me. I think it can be replaced by something simpler in the one test that uses it and then ditched once and for all.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18613#issuecomment-612705659,612705659,
