pstratem,2016-08-04T02:35:15Z,I've written python RPC tests to replace the tests.\n\nIt's much easier to maintain those tests and leads to fewer weird hacks in the setup for the tests (which is what I'm trying to avoid by removing the existing tests).\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8450#issuecomment-237436149,237436149,
jonasschnelli,2016-08-04T05:50:18Z,"utACK on the additional RPC test, NACK on removing the unit test.\n\nI don't think its wise to remove an already exiting unit test.\nAlso, UnitTests are on a different _level_ then the RPC tests. Keep in mind: we ship the unit tests with our binaries.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8450#issuecomment-237458837,237458837,

jonasschnelli,2016-08-04T06:39:04Z,"I think we need to distinct between tests on code level (linked, boost unit test framework) and test from the _outside_ (RPC tests). Both are useful.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8450#issuecomment-237465723,237465723,
laanwj,2016-08-04T08:57:05Z,"ACK on removing the 'unit test'. I agree both kinds of tests are useful, however. Unit tests are supposed to test basic, low-level behavior.\n\nE.g.:\n- Wallet unit tests test the CWallet object directly.\n- RPC unit tests tests basic RPC registration/dispatching.\n\nThe removed tests are clearly RPC (functional-level) tests disguised as unit tests. They are from the time that there wasn't a prope",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8450#issuecomment-237494069,237494069,
