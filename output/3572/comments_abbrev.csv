laanwj,2014-03-10T15:49:45Z,"@Diapolo whoa that's weird, so transifex is giving us an unparseable .ts file. I don't see anything strange at that line in `bitcoin_ko_KR.ts`.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3572#issuecomment-37197514,37197514,
laanwj,2014-03-10T16:07:01Z,"OK, pushed a fix for the translation file. There were some stray control characters in there (^H and ^) that lrelease could not cope with. This is really weird. I wonder if we should add a script to sanitize after `tx pull`.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3572#issuecomment-37199734,37199734,

laanwj,2014-04-04T10:20:02Z,"@Diapolo sure, but we're swamped with all kinds of pulls that update, improve or worsen the logging in subtle ways. That's giving quite a lot of review overhead without much apparent gain.
