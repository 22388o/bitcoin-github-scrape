jonasschnelli,2013-08-31T09:57:39Z,Yes. We should use that. @laanwj should i takeover again and fix these things?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2958#discussion_r6099751,6099751,src/qt/sendcoinsdialog.cpp
jonasschnelli,2013-08-31T09:58:41Z,Hmm... i would keep the current font. Even with fixed font's line breaks are possible.\nI also think fixed fonts can look really bad.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2958#discussion_r6099755,6099755,src/qt/sendcoinsdialog.cpp

laanwj,2013-08-31T10:25:19Z,@jonasschnelli I'd rather just get this merged ASAP and leave improvements to later. So if there's nothing breaking or obviously incorrect I'd like to get ACKs.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2958#discussion_r6099785,6099785,src/qt/sendcoinsdialog.cpp
