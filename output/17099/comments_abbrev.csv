laanwj,2019-10-10 18:16:17,"> We DO need to fix our docs for generating macOS SDKs... Previously we just tarred up MacOSX10.14.sdk, but we also need to copy over the headers as done here\n\nIf you need people to re-generate the MacOSX SDK, please document it well and make sure there's a way that people without Macs can do it (I don't have access to a Mac anymore, for one). Might want to combine it with the version upgrade.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17099#issuecomment-540708506,540708506,

MarcoFalke,2019-11-19 13:51:16,Is it really required to first bump clang to a more recent version and then in the next commit remove the hardcoded clang?
