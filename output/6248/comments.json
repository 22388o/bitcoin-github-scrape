    "body": "After researching the issue some over the weekend, I agree with @laanwj.\n\nTo clarify, this is an issue with gcc5 and newer clang+lto when qt is built with -reduce-relocations. Upstream GCC discussion is [here](https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=65886). \n\nWe have a few options:\n- Do nothing. I think I'd prefer this, reasoning below.\n- use -PIC instead for known-problematic compilers. This would mean maintaining a black-list since I don't believe this can be easily tested.\n- Use -PIC instead only when building bitcoin-qt _and_ using a problematic compiler _and_ when qt was built with -reduce-relocations (this can be tested via preprocessor).\n- Default to -PIC everywhere and override with -PIE when creating release binaries.\n\n2 and 3 would be necessary only for building bitcoin-qt, but we'd end up having to disable PIE for bitcoind as well, to avoid building 2 sets of objects.\n\nI believe that the root issue here is that distros are shipping qt libs with -reduce-relocations, which is known to violate abi specs and makes assumptions about how downstreams will use their libs. That abi spec violation became a real-world issue with the latest compilers.\n\nSo IMO, the more reasonable thing to do here would be to try to convince Arch to disable -reduce-relocations for their qt build. We can't be the only downstream with this issue.\n",

Also, it seems that `-fPIC` is set as the default directly in qt build scripts. So if you think that the flags need to be changed, they should be changed upstream, not in each and every Linux distribution that has this problem.\n",

    "body": "> Use -PIC instead only when building bitcoin-qt and using a problematic compiler and when qt was built with -reduce-relocations (this can be tested via preprocessor).\n\nRight, detecting this would be the right way to solve this. Although the logic is quite ugly, it's not that much worse than other auto\\* checks.\n\nAnd agree it would be even better if `-reduce-relocations` was not provided to the Qt build upstream. That's the root issue, not PIE versus PIC.\n\nStill NACK on setting `-fPIC` by default, so going to close this.\n",
