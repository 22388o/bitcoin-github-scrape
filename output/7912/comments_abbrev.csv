MarcoFalke,2016-04-20T10:35:53Z,"Jup, please the `b""""` here.\n\nCurrently they are included in #7814 but it also makes sense to add them here.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7912#discussion_r60385343,60385343,qa/rpc-tests/test_framework/mininode.py
laanwj,2016-04-20T11:18:53Z,"right: rationale is that message ids are byte sequences directly from the packet, not strings for user consumption, so they should be `bytes` not `str`\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7912#discussion_r60390155,60390155,qa/rpc-tests/test_framework/mininode.py
MarcoFalke,2016-04-20T11:50:12Z,"If you feel strongly about adding them in the other places as well:\n- `msg_reject`: `self.reason = b""""`\n\nand (optionally)\n\n``` py\ndef ser_uint256(u):\ndef ser_string_vector(l):\nCAlert().serialize(self):\n```\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7912#discussion_r60393334,60393334,qa/rpc-tests/test_framework/mininode.py

MarcoFalke,2016-04-20T12:13:48Z,"I have all of this included in my py3 branch, so it is not mandatory to fix all issues right now. (Otherwise I'd be creating pulls every other day to keep the whole py2 codebase ""updated"") E.g. we got new test in `fundrawtransaction.py` which are using the old `except JSONRPCException,e:` syntax but it is not worth to create a pull for those right now, imo.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7912#discussion_r60396013,60396013,qa/rpc-tests/test_framework/mininode.py
