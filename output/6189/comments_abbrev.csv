PRabahy,2015-05-27T00:27:58Z,Would it be worth it to include anything about switching wallets with pruning enabled? It is my understanding that if the blockfiles get pruned past where the wallet last updated that you will need to redownload the entire blockchain.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6189#issuecomment-105703419,105703419,
