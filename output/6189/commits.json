        "patch": "@@ -1,6 +1,73 @@\n (note: this is a temporary file, to be added-to by anybody, and moved to\n release-notes at release time)\n \n+Notable changes\n+===============\n+\n+Block file pruning\n+----------------------\n+\n+This release supports running a fully validating node without maintaining a copy \n+of the raw block and undo data on disk. To recap, there are four types of data \n+related to the blockchain in the bitcoin system: the raw blocks as received over \n+the network (blk???.dat), the undo data (rev???.dat), the block index and the \n+UTXO set (both LevelDB databases). The databases are built from the raw data.\n+\n+Block pruning allows Bitcoin Core to delete the raw block and undo data once \n+it's been validated and used to build the databases. At that point, the raw data \n+is used only to relay blocks to other nodes, to handle reorganizations, to look \n+up old transactions (if -txindex is enabled or via the RPC/REST interfaces), or \n+for rescanning the wallet. The block index continues to hold the metadata about \n+all blocks in the blockchain.\n+\n+The user specifies how much space to allot for block & undo files. The minimum \n+allowed is 550MB. Note that this is in addition to whatever is required for the \n+block index and UTXO databases. The minimum was chosen so that Bitcoin Core will \n+be able to maintain at least 288 blocks on disk (two days worth of blocks at 10 \n+minutes per block). In rare instances it is possible that the amount of space \n+used will exceed the pruning target in order to keep the required last 288 \n+blocks on disk.\n+\n+Block pruning works during initial sync in the same way as during steady state, \n+by deleting block files \"as you go\" whenever disk space is allocated. Thus, if \n+the user specifies 550MB, once that level is reached the program will begin \n+deleting the oldest block and undo files, while continuing to download the \n+blockchain.\n+\n+For now, block pruning disables block relay.  In the future, nodes with block \n+pruning will at a minimum relay \"new\" blocks, meaning blocks that extend their \n+active chain. \n+\n+Block pruning is currently incompatible with running a wallet due to the fact \n+that block data is used for rescanning the wallet and importing keys or \n+addresses (which require a rescan.) However, running the wallet with block \n+pruning will be supported in the near future, subject to those limitations.\n+\n+Block pruning is also incompatible with -txindex and will automatically disable \n+it.\n+\n+Once you have pruned blocks, going back to unpruned state requires \n+re-downloading the entire blockchain. To do this, re-start the node with \n+-reindex. Note also that any problem that would cause a user to reindex (e.g., \n+disk corruption) will cause a pruned node to redownload the entire blockchain. \n+Finally, note that when a pruned node reindexes, it will delete any blk???.dat \n+and rev???.dat files in the data directory prior to restarting the download.\n+\n+To enable block pruning on the command line:\n+\n+- `-prune=N`: where N is the number of MB to allot for raw block & undo data.\n+\n+Modified RPC calls:\n+\n+- `getblockchaininfo` now includes whether we are in pruned mode or not.\n+- `getblock` will check if the block's data has been pruned and if so, return an \n+error.\n+- `getrawtransaction` will no longer be able to locate a transaction that has a \n+UTXO but where its block file has been pruned. \n+\n+Pruning is disabled by default.\n+\n+\n 0.11.0 Change log\n =================\n "
