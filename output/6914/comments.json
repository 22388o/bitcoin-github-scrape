    "body": "I have tested this extensively-- including operation in valgrind, perhaps more than I've tested the current tip without it. I have read the patch and think it looks fine but I feel anything doing this exceeds my knowledge of the subtle behaviors of C++ so I do not consider my code review to have much value on this pull.\n\nI think it's okay to merge, and considering our interactions if it causes trouble during the 0.12 pre-release cycle its also not hard to back out: absent it; we're likely to ignore some performance problems in 0.12 chalking it up to \"well 6914 is a big fix\".  It will also see a _lot_ more testing if its merged for 0.12 (as I will have multiple people working full time on testing the 0.12 and the next elements update that will be 0.12 based). \n",
