sipa,2016-05-17T18:19:49Z,Is there a benefit to having different rpcauth pairs for each node?\n\n(that's a separate question from not hardcoding it)\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8066#issuecomment-219807478,219807478,
laanwj,2016-05-18T08:42:31Z,"@sipa I think the motivation is that it prevents accidentally connecting to the wrong/old instance which may still be sticking around.\nSpeaking of which, should we add a random per-session factor too?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8066#issuecomment-219962937,219962937,
laanwj,2016-05-18T08:44:11Z,"But one drawback I can see of this is that it makes it more difficult to diagnose after a non-cleanup test run, or interrogating a bitcoind stuck around after a crashing test. No longer is the user/password to query it obvious.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8066#issuecomment-219963323,219963323,
MarcoFalke,2016-05-18T16:08:20Z,"Indeed this is the drawback, which would mean I better remove the fancy utf-8 chars as well...\n\nObviously we are running the daemons on different ports, so within the test framework it is more than unlikely to accidentally speak to the wrong daemon. I think a reasonable compromise would be to use `'rt_u'+str(n)` and `'rt_p'+str(n)`.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8066#issuecomment-220076462,220076462,
laanwj,2016-05-21T13:45:18Z,"> No longer is the user/password to query it obvious.\n\nI  just realized this may be a smaller problem than I thought: we write a bitcoin.conf in every node directory with the user/password information so `bitcoin-cli -datadir=$DIR` can be used. As the directory is printed to stdout, I think there is not really a problem with 'guessing' the user/password.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8066#issuecomment-220778601,220778601,
