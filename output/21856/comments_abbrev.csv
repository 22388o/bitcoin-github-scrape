MarcoFalke,2021-05-05 06:11:31,"I did a survey of all bugs found first by fuzzing, excluding known bugs that can merely be reproduced by fuzzing (regression fuzz testing). I found that most bugs fall into one of the categories:\n* Silent merge conflict (forgetting to update the fuzz target after code changes)\n* A bug in the fuzz target itself\n* A recently introduced critical (exploitable) bug, but only present in the `maste",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21856#issuecomment-832438136,832438136,

It would be nice to give the people working on fuzzing access to whatever tools they feel would be useful assuming we have addressed prior concerns raised.\n\nI'm not clear if those concerns have been met or not though. I'm also not clear whether (or when) this decision to join Google's OSS-F",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21856#issuecomment-832601225,832601225,

I wasn't aware of https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/pull/5699 and I wasn't aware what had changed since https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/issues/739#issuecomment-614831028.
