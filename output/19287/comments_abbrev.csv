As I understand it `is` should only be used to check for ""pointer-equality"" and IIRC the only built-in type where that is acceptable (and maybe recommended) to use is `None`.\n\nDid you also check the functional test files and other python files in this repo for similar sharp edges?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19287#issuecomment-644438780,644438780,

As an implementation detail of CPython (not PyPy or others) `x is y` actually compares memory addresses, because on CPython `id(x)` returns the memory address of x.\n\n> the only built-in type where that is acceptable (and maybe recommended) to u",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19287#issuecomment-644548673,644548673,
