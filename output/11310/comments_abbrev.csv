jnewbery,2017-09-12T21:33:32Z,"#10740 requires a lot of review and test, so I think it's fine to merge this first.\n\nMy only comment is that `listwallets` doesn't necessarily guarantee an order for the returned wallets, so perhaps converting to a set and doing a set comparison is more correct.\n\nHowever, I'm probably just being overly picky. utACK d510ec5dff4de1df03463dda4238da3ceb60f8f3",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11310#issuecomment-328990740,328990740,
