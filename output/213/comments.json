    "body": "> Did you not start to compile with USE_UPNP=0/1 then stop and go back and compile with USE_UPNP=\n\nSorry, yeah -- you're totally right.  I thought I was building from scratch, but I think what happened was:\n- I initially built using stock bitcoin source (no makefile tweaks)\n- That failed since I don't have the UPNP library.\n- Then I tweaked makefile.unix to have \"USE_UPNP:=\"\n- ...and that gave me the error described in issue #212.\n\nSo this indeed only seems to be an issue when you build with stale object files in /obj.\nStill, I think the above series of steps are probably not uncommon, among people who lack the upnp library, so I think it's a build use-case that's worth being concerned about. :)\n",
