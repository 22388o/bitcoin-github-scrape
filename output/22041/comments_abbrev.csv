practicalswift,2021-05-25 20:22:24,"Concept ACK\n\nThere is a trade-off here: making `--enable-suppress-external-warnings` the default will allow us to apply additional `-W` and `-Werror` options which will increase the likelihood of finding issues _local_ to our code base, and it will increase the signal to noise. OTOH doing so might reduce the likelihood of us finding issues in upstream code bases.\n\nSince we have to choose a",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22041#issuecomment-848233821,848233821,
vasild,2021-05-28 16:47:04,"Concept ~0\n\nThe idea behind `--enable-suppress-external-warnings` is to be able to compile with `-Werror`, lots of `-Wall` and not be dragged down by boost/qt/etc issues. `-Werror` is for devs.\n\nI don't agree with hiding warnings from users in order to increase their trust.

vasild,2021-05-31 08:58:01,"> Isn't it the same as not passing non-default `-W` to a compiler, or using compiler's pragmas?\n\nYes, it is! And also, if external headers are installed in `/usr/include`, then warnings from them are swept under the carpet by the compiler already, regardless of `--enable-suppress-external-warnings`.\n\nThere are arguments for both doing and not doing this.
