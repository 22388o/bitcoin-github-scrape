OTOH doing so might reduce the likelihood of us finding issues in upstream code bases.\r\n\r\nSince we have to choose a default I think it makes sense to make the higher signal-to-noise alternative which focuses on local issues the default (`--enable-suppress-external-warnings`), and make `--disable-suppress-external-warnings` opt-in.",
