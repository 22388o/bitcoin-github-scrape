btcdrak,2016-09-15T15:03:47Z,"As it stands this will leak the xpriv since the xpriv will be in the command history. The import of the xpriv should be interactive and should be encrypted before being stored.\n\nI know previously we would not recommend forcing encryption because it could lead to funds loss, here the user already has the xpriv so it's already backed up.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8735#issuecomment-247354717,247354717,

jonasschnelli,2016-09-15T15:27:50Z,"Yes. I'm aware of the security weakness of accepting a xpriv over a startup argument.\nA previous proposed solution would be to support a tool called `bitcoin-wallet` which could create, alter and encrypt wallet without the need of bitcoind (this would by my preferred solution but can be added later).\n\nI think accepting a xpriv over a configuration value is not extremely bad.
