    "body": "Opinions differ on that. I think the status quo is to have *some* license marker in every source file because files tend to get copied around on their own sometimes. This is why the SPDX standard was designed. It's more set in stone than either a website reference or local repo reference. But it's newer than bitcoin.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, IMO, it's not worth changing this at this point, the incremental benefit to changing this now is zilch. I would suggest letting this go and finding another way to contribute.",
