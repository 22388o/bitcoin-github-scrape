benma,2017-03-01T01:31:25Z,"Was a bug, or is a bug? Because it is still not called with (0), and I am not sure under what circumstances it should be, seeing that the runaway exception signal is called when shutdown fails.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9834#discussion_r103593584,103593584,src/qt/bitcoin.cpp
jonasschnelli,2017-03-01T12:15:15Z,"The int return value was only use over qDebug which we can argue what it should have been there.\nBut this PRs solution (remove the shutdown result value) seems to make most sense.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9834#discussion_r103670531,103670531,src/qt/bitcoin.cpp
