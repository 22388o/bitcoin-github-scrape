laanwj,2014-08-07T07:22:06Z,I agree on the idea.\n\nI think strictly spoken what it needs is 'libtoolize' (which either can be in the path or can be overridden with LIBTOOLIZE). See also the statements after it.\n\n@theuni any comments? do you know is there an argument on autoreconf to automagically fail (with a saner message) if we can't libtoolize?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4647#discussion_r15921348,15921348,autogen.sh
nuggetbram,2014-08-07T07:26:03Z,"I did this after trying to install this on my ubuntu - it crashed for some reason, looked it up, installed libtool and now it works. Would it be possible to include libtool in-tree?

laanwj,2014-08-07T14:55:40Z,"Eh, yes, that message seems to be as clear and in-your-face as error messages get.\n\nI mean why would\n\n```\nLibtool is Missing.
