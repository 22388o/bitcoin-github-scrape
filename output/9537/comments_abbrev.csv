TheBlueMatt,2017-05-29T21:44:19Z,"Gaa, can we not add more C++ exceptions? They are generally very strongly discouraged across the board by sandard C++ guidelines, for various reasons.

sipa,2018-03-06T18:36:20Z,Concept ACK in the sense that using -1 as exceptional value may be improvable. I'm not a fan of using exceptions though; what about boost::optional?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9537#issuecomment-370882772,370882772,
