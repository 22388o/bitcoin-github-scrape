    "body": "@kleetus Thanks. Fwiw, I agree completely with @sipa.\n\nI doubt you'll get them to make any changes that would require any autotools-like features, but you may be able to split up their files somewhat so that we could include them directly. IIRC from the last time I looked into this, we'd just need their file-list split off to a separate .mk. We could handle the rest ourselves.\n",
