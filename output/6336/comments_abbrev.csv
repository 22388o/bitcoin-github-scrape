At the least, submit the changes to bitcoin/leveldb, where\nour branch of the LevelDB code is hosted. Ideally, submit it to\ngoogle/leveldb and hopefully it will become available for all users :)\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6336#issuecomment-115017793,115017793,

theuni,2015-06-25T03:06:18Z,"@kleetus Thanks. Fwiw, I agree completely with @sipa.\n\nI doubt you'll get them to make any changes that would require any autotools-like features, but you may be able to split up their files somewhat so that we could include them directly. IIRC from the last time I looked into this, we'd just need their file-list split off to a separate .mk. We could handle the rest ourselves.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6336#issuecomment-115086089,115086089,
