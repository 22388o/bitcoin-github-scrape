Sjors,2019-01-15T15:27:00Z,"Concept ACK on general documentation of how to use the RPC, as well as maybe providing more context for specific issues.\n\nHowever, I'm worried that maintaining this list of `bitcoind` options is going to get out of sync.

Sjors,2019-02-19T08:12:31Z,"Nit / later: explain that as an alternative you can run the daemon in one tab and use bitcoin-cli in another. That way you can keep an eye on logs.
