laanwj,2015-10-31T09:42:04Z,I like this backported becase:\n- It it pretty well self-contained\n- Will make it possible to downgrade from databases started with 0.12/master to 0.11.x\n- Can be combined with #6917 to mitigate all known windows corruption issues\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6919#issuecomment-152718597,152718597,

gmaxwell,2015-10-31T19:02:23Z,"@luke-jr ugh, that would defeat much of the purpose because the people who need this won't know to turn it on.  If you already have data and don't reindex, it stays null however. \n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6919#issuecomment-152764151,152764151,
luke-jr,2015-10-31T19:35:54Z,"As I see it, the primary purpose is of the backport is to be compatible with 0.12. If we don't want to wait on new features like this, we should just go ahead and release 0.12 early.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6919#issuecomment-152765828,152765828,
gmaxwell,2015-10-31T19:42:32Z,@luke-jr I don't think that is an interesting reason to backport.  Combined with the levedb fix this will end the constant corruption issues that are making the software unusable to many windows users.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6919#issuecomment-152766099,152766099,
laanwj,2015-11-01T09:00:04Z,"> Suggest disabling (using null) obfuscation by default in 0.11 so it remains compatible to 0.10.\n\nIMO due to the way obfuscation is used, only for _new_ databases, that's not an issue. The people that want to go back to 0.10 will (usually) have started syncing on 0.10. And in the rare case it's not, they can just reindex.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6919#issuecomment-152808061,152808061,
laanwj,2015-11-05T08:17:00Z,Closing this - even though this was a zero-hassle backport I'm not convinced that this is correct and I don't expect to find enough testing.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6919#issuecomment-153984378,153984378,
