jonasschnelli,2016-05-11T19:40:42Z,@Tyler-Hardin: Right.\nAnd OSX is also picky with the main menu. I'm pretty sure removing the menu will lead into losing the Ctrl-Q / quit option during the startup/splashscreen state.\n\nThe menu itself doesn't hurt during the splash screen.\nIt would just require some work to make the debug window compatible for that state (which is not worth doing that why I propose this PR/simple fix).\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8042#issuecomment-218567243,218567243,
