laanwj,2015-05-21T10:51:28Z,"Not convinced about this. I do think we want to be able to remove unconfirmed, or conflicting transactions at some point (e.g. when implementing replace-by-fee, or other cases where the transaction is to time out after a while if it doesn't make it into a block).\n(""hide"" semantics would work too, of course, instead of truly deleting, but there needs to be a notification path for this)\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6152#issuecomment-104224288,104224288,
luke-jr,2015-06-02T03:58:34Z,"@laanwj I don't see a case where deleting or hiding a still-valid transaction is a good idea. And the only way it can become invalid is if a conflicting one is confirmed; even in that case, I don't think we want erase semantics. IMO the signal should go. The wallet may conceivably want to erase a transaction it is respending itself, especially once the respend has confirmed, so I agree the CWallet",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6152#issuecomment-107794432,107794432,
laanwj,2015-06-03T15:56:54Z,"@luke-jr True, in the case I mentioned it will be the wallet itself deciding to remove the transaction, not the node logic. So the notification path could go...\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6152#issuecomment-108496250,108496250,
