dcousens,2015-08-17T00:47:11Z,"Agreed,  the `&` would be much clearer here and is more typical for a masking operation of this type.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6556#issuecomment-131645864,131645864,
morcos,2015-08-17T14:55:24Z,I thought about `&` but I wasn't confident it was ok to change the previous behavior.\nI also couldn't see how to make it as short?\n`vchRet.push_back(GetByte(15 - nStartByte) & (((1 << nBits) - 1) << (8 - nBits)));`\nor \n`vchRet.push_back(GetByte(15 - nStartByte) & ~((1 << (8-nBits)) - 1));`\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6556#issuecomment-131851900,131851900,

laanwj,2015-08-19T15:09:47Z,utACK.\nThere was a similar error in the netmask parsing.\nAgree @jonasschnelli that unit tests for this function would be nice.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6556#issuecomment-132633635,132633635,
morcos,2015-08-19T17:27:54Z,"Ok writing unit test.  I have a question about `IsLocal()`, since those addresses are also `!IsRoutable()` they will be lumped in the `NET_UNROUTABLE` group instead of having their own group.  The check for `IsLocal()` on line 932 is meaningless.  Is that expected?  Changing that would obviously change existing behavior.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6556#issuecomment-132705259,132705259,
