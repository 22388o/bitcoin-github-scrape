JeremyRubin,2021-10-29 16:55:32,"> Batch `getblockhash` and then batch this?\n\nyou actually need to getblockheader to get the height, then getblockhash for the N you need, and then call getblockheader for the N. And this still has a concurrency bug since the getblockhash do not execute atomically afaiu (a reorg could happen in between).",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23330#issuecomment-954898069,954898069,

In every other case, braces are required, and the then and else clauses must appear correctly indented on a new line.\n```",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23330#discussion_r734705832,734705832,src/rpc/blockchain.cpp
