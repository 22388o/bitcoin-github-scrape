laanwj,2014-02-18T16:28:34Z,"Maybe it'd be better to change the constants to bytes (move the shifts to the constants instead of at the comparison site in init.cpp).\nShowing in MiB is only UI/commandline-level. Regardless, you need shifts at either place.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3703#issuecomment-35402304,35402304,

laanwj,2014-02-19T07:31:41Z,"@Diapolo Using multiplications instead of shifts would have resulted in the same problem.
