MarcoFalke,2020-03-05 19:59:22,Is this needed to prevent leaks on exit?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17972#discussion_r388530397,388530397,src/test/fuzz/key.cpp
practicalswift,2020-03-05 21:14:04,It was a while since I wrote the code but IIRC I assumed that `ECC_Stop();` was needed run at shutdown in order to avoid leaks (as part of `~ECCContext()`). That appears not to be the case so I've now dropped `ECCContext`. Please re-review :),https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17972#discussion_r388568991,388568991,src/test/fuzz/key.cpp
