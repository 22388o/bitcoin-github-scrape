laanwj,2014-01-31T08:14:10Z,"What we ship with gitian are the _recommended_ dependency versions. The _minimum required_ dependency versions shouldn't be bumped unless really necessary.\nThis is because ""stable""/""enterprise"" linux distributions tend to have very old versions of dependencies. The same for tool chains for old versions of OSX (in the case of this LLVM workaround).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3604#issuecomment-33768156,33768156,
