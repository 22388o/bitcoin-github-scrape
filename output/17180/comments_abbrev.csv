promag,2019-10-21 11:44:27,Probably nice but IMO not worth the effort. A constant tooltip is fine.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17180#issuecomment-544477128,544477128,

JeremyCrookshank,2019-10-21 23:00:30,Had some issues with Git(still need to squash them?). I have however committed my PR which means the tooltip now reflects the selected unit appropriately.

laanwj,2019-10-22 11:14:12,"Personally, I don't think it's useful to parametrize the tooltip on the selected unit. This also makes translation harder.
