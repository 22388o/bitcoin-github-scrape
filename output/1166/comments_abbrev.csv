Diapolo,2012-05-03T07:25:50Z,"Rebased to be a single commit, no further code-changes.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1166#issuecomment-5482319,5482319,
laanwj,2012-05-01T06:39:46Z,"I'd prefer also doing `ui->signature->clear()`, then defining this help message as ""Placeholder text"" in the ui file. This has the same functionality, but also shades the help text in grey (and with the difference that the message isn't repeated twice in the code).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1166#discussion_r754871,754871,src/qt/messagepage.cpp
Diapolo,2012-05-01T09:47:54Z,"I didn't know that clear() restores the default text, so yes your suggestion is much nicer. Will re-work this.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1166#discussion_r755280,755280,src/qt/messagepage.cpp
