Also the minimum dependency version should be properly documented in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/dependencies.md#dependencies to have an objective criteria to decide on what workarounds are acceptable and which ones are not. Currently it is not documented and I (incorrectly?) assumed that only the bundled univalue is supported. The lack of clarification will lead to subjective disagreement about what versions are supported.\r\n\r\nFinally, the patch seems incomplete anyway. It is a workaround for the fix for arrays I submitted in https://github.com/bitcoin-core/univalue/commit/98fadc090984fa7e070b6c41ccb514f69a371c85, however it doesn't seem to address the same issue that was fixed for dictionaries in https://github.com/bitcoin-core/univalue/commit/51d3ab34ba2857f0d03dc07250cb4a2b5e712e67",

    "body": "Sorry @luke-jr, but this is ridiculous. Upstream is _obviously_ unmaintained. It seems the maintainer has not had any comments/commits or other activity in over two years, while there have been PRs opened and commented on on a semi-regular basis. Bitcoin Core has had its own fork for a while, because the maintenance situation was sporadic before for time before already, but at this point there is no reason to keep treating that repo as upstream - it's dead. And the fact that it works without maintenance is not a reason why improvements to our fork can't be made. So I think we should simply start treating the https://github.com/bitcoin-core/univalue repository as upstream. You can't go call clear improvements to the codebase \"going out of your way to create a divergent fork\" when upstream isn't accepting any changes at all.",

I've summarized my thoughts in #22646, which removes support for system univalue.\r\n\r\n> PRs like #22412 highlight the \"issue\" with us operating with our own Univalue fork, where we actively fix bugs, and make improvements, when upstream (https://github.com/jgarzik/univalue) may not be taking those improvements, and by all accounts, is not currently actively maintained. Bitcoin Core should not be hamstrung into not being able to fix bugs in a library, and/or have to litter our source with \"workarounds\", i.e #22412, for bugs we've already fixed, based on the fact that an upstream project is not actively being maintained. Allowing builders to use system libs is really only exacerbating this problem, with little benefit to our project.\r\n\r\nAlso\r\n\r\n> It's now essentially the end of the month, and I can't yet see any new activity in https://github.com/jgarzik/univalue.\r\n\r\nAnother month has passed and there's neither release activity, not commentary on any of the new PRs by Bitcoin Core contributors in the https://github.com/jgarzik/univalue/ repo.\r\n",
