esotericnonsense,2017-09-18T04:51:30Z,"An additional performance gain could be gotten by tying this HWM to a percentage of the prune target. \n\nFor example, with prune=100000 you could let the data get to 100G x 1.10 before pruning, or cap it at 100G and prune down to 100G x 0.90 (similar effect on dbcache in both cases).\n\nLooking at the documentation in -help:\n```\nautomatically prune block files to stay under the specified ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11359#issuecomment-330129093,330129093,
sdaftuar,2017-09-29T19:09:49Z,"No strong feelings from me, but when we worked on the pruning implementation our goal was to have the target be something that should be achievable.  So if we were to decide that it's worth exceeding it intentionally (eg for performance reasons during ibd), we should remember that we need to clearly communicate that to users.\n\nBut now that we in theory support non-atomic flushes, perhaps we ca",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11359#issuecomment-333212921,333212921,
luke-jr,2017-11-10T09:42:48Z,"Indeed, users expect that if they set `prune=5000`, the blockchain size remains <= 5000 MB. Perhaps it would make sense to have a `prune-extra` option to specify additional space to free when doing pruning and reduce its frequency (we can default it to 10% or something).",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11359#issuecomment-343425879,343425879,
