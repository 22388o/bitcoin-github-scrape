    "body": "Ah! That keyword is very helpful. Did some Googling... Looks like it can be done with the GUI, but the trick is that you need to go to the global Virtualbox preferences, and create a new \"NAT Network\", where you can (among other things) set the address range. Once you've done that, you can attach the individuals VMs to that network. A very counterintuitive way to do that, if you ask me. @laanwj want to try it and update the guide? I'd do it, but I'm on my phone and don't know when I'll be able to get around to it, and also I'm on Windows, so the GUI looks different. Better to keep it consistent. @theuni Good catch!\n",
