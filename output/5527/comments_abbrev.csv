I'd really rather not mix gui/cli commands though, let's try to use one or the other.\n\nTo change the ip range, I instead created a new Nat Network, set it to 10.0.11.0/24, and bound gitianbuilder to that. All via the GUI, and it seems to work with no issues. Any reason not to use that approach?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5527#issuecomment-72782599,72782599,

Michagogo,2015-02-04T10:55:15Z,"Ah! That keyword is very helpful. Did some Googling... Looks like it can be done with the GUI, but the trick is that you need to go to the global Virtualbox preferences, and create a new ""NAT Network"", where you can (among other things) set the address range. Once you've done that, you can attach the individuals VMs to that network. A very counterintuitive way to do that, if you ask me. @laanwj wa",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5527#issuecomment-72835694,72835694,
