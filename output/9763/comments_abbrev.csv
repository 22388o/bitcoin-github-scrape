CryptAxe,2017-02-15T22:37:31Z,"It's useful to know where the transaction is being checked before it is added using this function. Otherwise I guess you could use grep to figure out where AcceptToMemoryPool() went but why not just say where it is? \n\nEdit: I guess if it moves again then this comment will need to be updated so that is a valid concern.
