sipa,2018-06-28T08:42:18Z,"CAddress serialization is at least used inside ""addr"" and ""version"" messages on the network.

One project I think is interesting would be to separate out the CNetAddr/CAddress/CService/CAddrInfo/etc into a composition-based relationship rather  than an inheritance-based one, because the aggregate is pretty broad. May push something up to that effect down the line.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13560#issuecomment-401036353,401036353,
