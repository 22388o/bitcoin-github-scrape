What it does is clear and simple and there is no reason to avoid it.\n2. This one has been discussed over and over again (we've had one pull request or another sitting around getting slow discussion about the possibility of attackers hitting bitcoin with URIs since before 0.4).

You ACKed it first time and I don't think this aspect changed. \n\nGiven that there are no fatal bugs in boost::interprocess and the Qt URL parser, I think it's pretty unlikely there are security problems.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/991#issuecomment-4699532,4699532,
