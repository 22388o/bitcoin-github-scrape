gmaxwell,2013-07-12T22:24:22Z,Hm. Does pywallet not correctly handle the height records?  If its adding a key to a wallet it should zero it out.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2824#issuecomment-20907699,20907699,
sipa,2013-07-12T22:25:55Z,"I suppose it does not, but even then - there shouldn't ever be a need to rescan except when loading a wallet, so this should be done via the command-line (-reindex) instead of via RPC?\n\nOr is there a reason why an RPC is preferrable?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2824#issuecomment-20907757,20907757,
