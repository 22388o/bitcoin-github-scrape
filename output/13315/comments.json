    "body": "@promag I tried a 10000 limit first, and that also works (for now). But the default of 1000 seems too low.\r\n\r\nIn older versions of ZMQ the default was \"no limit\" anyway. \r\n\r\nThe queue is per SUBscriber, so if you have thousands of listeners to the node you might see some increase in memory usage.  I was not able to see an increase in memory usage on my system with 6 subscribers on different computers.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the setting is not for a limit in MB , that would have made it easier to configure. \r\nevery value now seems somewhat arbitrary, and it highly depends on how many subscribers are connected \r\n-edit- I did some more testing and these peaks are about 3000messages and 3MB in size and happen when a block is found (or synced). So, in worst case scenario of a totally failing router or nic on your network the queue would grow at about 3MB per block. \r\nSo if I want to limit memory usage to 500Mb, the SNDHWM value should be 500000 / number of subscribers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ",

    "body": "To elaborate--ZMQ's high watermark buffered message limit prevents the ZMQ sending process from blocking when downstream resources (network bandwidth) are insufficient to handle the message volume. (The remote end can detect this when sequence numbers get skipped.) \r\n\r\nThis was originally chosen by design to be left at the default in order to be *conservative*--enabling ZMQ notifications and connecting a client should *not* have any potential adverse impact on bitcoind operation.\r\n\r\nI think allowing this behavior to be tuned via a command line or config file option, to set the numerical value of the high water mark, including turning it off, would be very useful for people relying on this interface. Unfortunately, it is a per-socket behavior and not per-notification, but that's the best that can be done.",

The performance of the client simply does not affect the server (bitcoind). \r\n(again, not talking about network performance here,  as pointed out earlier).\r\n\r\nFrom here it seems you wanted to claim ownership over this part of the code. Which fine with me - really.- (I don't even use my own name. take all the credit if you want...).  But now it seems any progress on this part is halted by you, for unknown reasons.\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "thanks for the reply, @jmcorgan \r\nFirst of all, it is a volunteer project for me as well. Tbh, I'm not even that interested in this change, but \r\nthe LND folks have been complaining about it for over a year, and it seems important, so I investigated the issue, made a case and provided evidence. \r\n(Why? because I worked with ZMQ before, so I knew about this issue for some years already.  And I like to fix stuff.)\r\n\r\nMy task is to identify problems (not a popular thing to do, but someone has to do it).\r\nWhat I've done is identifying a issue that was a big question-mark for some for years and provided evidence. I've mentioned the issue a few times on different platforms, but it seems these kind of things do not communicate well in a chat. As a result, I wrote it down in a ticket, with proof, and some code.\r\n\r\nI created some code only to make a case - I don't claim any proficiency in C++  so I want others to improve it. It should be low-hanging fruit for everyone else. \r\n\r\nOver the last months I've patiently waited and tried to contact you a few times (as have others) but never got a response. (that is just rude)\r\nI've created the code to make it configurable, as suggested by some - even though we all know that is pointless without figuring out FIRST what a functional HWM value should be anyway;  it doesn't even solve the issue, and no one who suggested it made a case for why it would solve anything...   \r\n\r\nI've asked you (or anyone else) to suggest a better default HWM value; never got a reply. The reason why seems quite obvious: no one actually tested what the right value is on their system.\r\nThe current '1000' is a arbitrary value, which doesn't make any sense when you think about it. \r\n\r\n(as a scientist) I ask you to defend why '1000' is the correct value\r\n\r\n\r\n",
