laanwj,2014-06-04T10:31:09Z,"@diapolo I suggest just cutting off long addresses (ie with ellipsis), then show the full address on hover. That's the accepted way of doing this. I remember there is some Qt mode for doing this, ""elide mode"" or something like that, but I'm not sure this is supported in tables.\nEdit: so no automatic resizing should happen based on the table contents!\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4285#issuecomment-45075073,45075073,
Diapolo,2014-06-04T11:37:24Z,"@laanwj Small question, starting height means blocks a peer had when connecting to him or is that the current number of blocks it has? I think it would be better to replace starting height with something more valuable for a normal user like `number of blocks on connect` for example.\n\nI also would like to re-order the information in the node details to be better or easier to read.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4285#issuecomment-45080075,45080075,
