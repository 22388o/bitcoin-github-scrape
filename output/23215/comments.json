This PR does not introduce it. It rather makes sure that the cache will be re-populated when vcpkg version is bumped. Maybe also it's reasonable to invalidate the cache when `msbuild -version` is changed?\r\n\r\nBtw, the \"Binary Caching\" feature is enabled by default [now](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/all-vcpkg-enterprise-features-now-generally-available-versioning-binary-caching-manifests-and-registries/) (as the \"Manifest Mode\" feature as well), and no need to pass `binarycaching` to the `VCPKG_FEATURE_FLAGS` variable.\r\n\r\n- Downloads Caching\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces new cache which is not an internal vcpkg feature, but rather a CI's one. These downloads actually are internal vcpkg dependencies, not ours. ",
