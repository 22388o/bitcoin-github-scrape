This is even explicitly stated in the [developer notes](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/developer-notes.md#source-code-organization):\r\n\r\n> Every .cpp and .h file should #include every header file it directly uses classes, functions or other definitions from, even if those headers are already included indirectly through other headers.\r\n\r\nThat said, I agree that this is of course not a very important fix - but it is also trivial and straight-forward, so has hardly any costs either.  But if you think it is not useful to merge simple patches like this, I'm happy to close the PR instead (I've fixed the issue for my own projects already, so I don't need it).",
