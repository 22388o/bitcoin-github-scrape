Have you used iwyu?\n\nMaster compiles because apparently `rpc/util.h` is only included together with `rpc/protocol.h` anyway, so it is fine in that situation.  I personally noticed it because of tinkering with the code in a separate effort, where this is apparently not the ca",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15435#issuecomment-465010593,465010593,

domob1812,2019-02-19T12:41:36Z,"> Sorry but I don't see this as a bug fix.\n\nWhy not?  It is clearly a coding mistake to rely on symbols from a header that is not included.  This is even explicitly stated in the [developer notes](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/developer-notes.md#source-code-organization):\n\n> Every .cpp and .h file should #include every header file it directly uses classes, functions or",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15435#issuecomment-465113812,465113812,
