A JSON parser could still convert large numbers to float silently. Returning the values as strings means the program can use whatever internal format they want - it moves parsing away from the JSON parser, which is usually hard to override.\n\nWe already added h",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9855#issuecomment-282467878,282467878,
