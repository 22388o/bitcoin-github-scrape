    "body": "NACK doing it in this way.\r\n\r\n- I'd prefer \"return amounts as strings\". It would be more consistent.  \"Integers\" don't exist in JSON. A JSON parser could still convert large numbers to float silently. Returning the values as strings means the program can use whatever internal format they want - it moves parsing away from the JSON parser, which is usually hard to override.\r\n\r\nWe already added handling of these for input in `AmountFromValue` in #6380, with the idea of making that an option later.\r\n\r\n- If you really want to go ahead with this please see my implementation in #3759. It was much less invasive, effectively only two functions were touched `AmountFromValue`  and `ValueFromAmount`, and it allowed the user to select between four variants with a command-line option. \r\n\r\nThere is no need to change every single call site of those functions for this!\r\n",
