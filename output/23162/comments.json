Even having to render the image as a bitmap on the server side might be more DoS-risky.\r\n\r\nFWIW, I first used Pillow on the Python side, but it doesn't [currently support SVG](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/issues/3509). so I worked around it by using ImageMagick to convert to a trivial image format (PPM) and loading that manually. If the image format was changed to something else we could use Pillow, instead. But I'm not really sure it's a more convenient dependency than ImageMagick.",

    "body": "> Theoretically, it is possible to do it in non-unicode terminals using normal ASCII. It doesn't look as pretty though. There's some very advanced algorithms for this, but a dumb pixel_value = \"$@B%8&WM#*oahkbdpqwmZO0QLCJUYXzcvunxrjft/\\|()1{}[]?-_+~<>i!lI;:,\\\"^`'.\"[n] ought to do for simple purposes like this.\r\n\r\nFeel free to add another mode, if you can get that readable enough. Preferably without adding a dependency on libaa or such, or a lot of code, at least this is straightforward and looking at the comments here, unicode Braille support is common enough.\r\n\r\n> You may also want to get ImageMagick to do the binarization. It has a bit more sophisticated facilities for that, if the captcha ever gets harder.\r\n\r\nThat's an interesting suggestion. It can also do dithering instead of a naive threshold, which might or might not help. I didn't initially want to rely on ImageMagick too much, in case the image format changes to something that Pillow can natively handle, but as it's not using that anymore, it doesn't seem bad to commit further to that direction.\r\n\r\nEdit: I tried adding `-monochrome` but this doesn't seem to make it better, if anything it gets slightly more noisy (see especially the \"e\"). I think I prefer to keep it like this:\r\n![captcha-faucet-comparison](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/126646/135988927-91772705-92b1-4460-a6bc-6a838c9933d4.png)\r\n",

    "body": "> Although now that I was thinking about possible ways to test this, there is one issue which can be managed by adding a warning that \"captcha\" is based on third party URL.\r\n\r\nAs far as I know, the captcha is generated on the same host as the faucet itself. The faucet could already return any kind of information in an error that is printed directly to the console (including control characters, any unicode and escape sequences). The captcha isn't worse in that sense. If you want to harden it you could do various things:\r\n\r\n- Sanitize any strings coming from the faucet.\r\n- Require the captcha to be in a specific image format (this is currently left open), by making the input `-:svg`. This is a compromise as it would limit flexibility to change image formats in the future.\r\n- Limit the size/complexity of the SVG, limit dimensions\u2014don't know if ImageMagick has introspection into this before actually rendering the thing, you might need a sifferent SVG parser.\r\n\r\nYou're welcome to work on this but I see it as outside the scope of this pull request.",
