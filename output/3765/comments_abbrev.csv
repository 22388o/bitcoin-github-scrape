laanwj,2014-02-28T07:42:49Z,"NACK. This was rejected before because it is harmful to the network, it makes no sense to resubmit this.\n_If_ nodes are sending you duplicate blocks that usually means that your node asked for them. So fix the request algorithm, don't punish nodes for replying.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3765#issuecomment-36328263,36328263,
rebroad,2014-02-28T18:41:22Z,"@laanwj so, to clarify, what should happen if a node requests a block from a node, but that node never responds with it? Should it wait forever, potentially never getting the block, or should it disconnect the node that isn't responding? Surely these are the only two options.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3765#issuecomment-36380964,36380964,

laanwj,2014-03-01T09:12:46Z,"As for disconnecting nodes that don't answer, don't we already have a ping mechanism for that? I do suppose a malicious node could just ignore requests for blocks while answering pings, but that's not something that would be armored against with this pull.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3765#issuecomment-36420209,36420209,
