If I understood the code of tests correctly, they are like integration tests where you have bunch of the nodes running and you verify the results in the end. I think the C++ code [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/05757aa860215a8fd5002d99b6ec653175c6b734/src/util/system.cpp#L1336-L1339) gets the CPU count wrong in case of running in a container. In case of the KVM containers the VM running it is the same size so it works. I think in this case, each node in the integration tests is trying to use 32 cores even though it's throttled by the cgroups. Do you know if there is an easy way to verify my theory and see how many CPUs TestNodes are trying to use during tests?",
