    "body": "@instagibbs I think this is intentionally a total fee.  There are BIP 125 requirements both for the fee rate and the total fee of the replacement transaction, but the one that is more likely to cause an issue is the total fee because it requires looking at all the descendant transactions of the original.  Thus if manually specifying the replacement transaction, you have clearer control by specifying the total fee.",
