    "body": "Great, an direct URL handler would certainly be useful\n\nSome comments:\n- qtipcserver: I think it would be preferable to implement this entire feature in src/qt, without touching the core\n- ThreadSafeHandleURL: Does it need to block? Otherwise, you could shorten the function by leaving out the `DirectConnection`/`BlockedQueuedConnection` and simply use `QueuedConnection` to send signals asynchronously\n- Security: any browser<->bitcoin UI binding scares me a bit. Can javascript applications DDOS bitcoin by sending masses of URLs? (or sneak in an extra payment at unexpected times). Maybe we need to add a dialog box for confirmation.\n",

I'm assuming there is a simple way to do this, but I dont feel like spending a ton of time digging through qt docs to figure it out when I'm assuming @laanwj probably knows the solution, so how would one scroll to the end directly after adding a new SendCoinEntry?\n",

    "body": "OK, I think Ive addressed every issue with this, except for the question of whether to popup before adding the recipient to the transaction or not until the send confirm dialog.  I am of the opinion that there shouldnt be an extra popup before adding as it will annoy users if you can create a desktop popup once per second (or any other time frame) from js.  I would instead just say that since the sendcoinsentry scrolls to the bottom when new recipients are added, it can be safely left up to the user to check the send (especially since the list of recipients is repeated in the confirmation dialog anyway).\n",
