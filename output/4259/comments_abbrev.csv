The pull just aims to make shutdown more reliable. getaddrinfo is not interruptible, which means that shutdown of bitcoind will wait which may take a long time.\n\nIf boost::asio is so awful (which I sort-of agree on, at least the debugging aspect), any points for a better network library we could switch to for at",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4259#issuecomment-45192088,45192088,

Yes, this method is pretty handy for this purpose, I'd like suggest to put it as another CNetAddr constructor instead of a independent function.  Actually I've implement it so, will submit a PR including this change soon, and I have to say that boost::asio was discovered to be not perfect for this case...\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4259#issuecomment-45370094,45370094,
