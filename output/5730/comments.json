The most straightforward, inclusive, and accurate choice is that \"he\" refers to people who use \"he\" as their preferred pronoun.\n\nAlso there is no significant argument that using either \"they\" or \"he or she\" is \"complicating things\" relative to \"he\". Any difference in complexity is negligable; that isn't the issue here.\n\nOn the issue of grammatical correctness of singular they, see https://motivatedgrammar.wordpress.com/2009/09/10/singular-they-and-the-many-reasons-why-its-correct/\n",

    "body": "@luke-jr That changes the meaning in a way that does not reflect the intent. Each attacker potentially has different knowledge about \"where anything useful is located\". Any particular attacker trying to bypass ASLR faces a problem whose difficulty is dependent on that attacker's knowledge, and not on other attackers' knowledge. The statement is not dependent on no attackers knowing \"where anything useful is located\", and so it is imprecise to lump all attackers together, or all attackers' knowledge together. I realise that a reader could nevertheless interpret the plural statement as intended, but it can also be misinterpreted in a way that the singular/generic \"An attacker...\" statement can't.\n\n(Also, \"grammatically plural\" is an imprecise concept. Semantic plurality and syntactic plurality are in general independent.)\n",
