    "body": "If there are plans to add more functionality back to this functions (which I wouldn't oppose too), and I can only think that you are referring to this check https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/validation.cpp#L2967 then we definitely don't want either this PR or @luke-jr 's suggestion of going further and fully remove CheckBlockHeader in one step.\r\n\r\nBut if we don't plan to put that code back there, then the fCheckPOW parameter doesn't make any sense in CheckBlockHeader. Better is better. This was supposed to be the simplest fix for something that honestly looks embarrassing when I think of reviewers reading this function without looking at the history or thinking about https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/validation.cpp#L2967 .\r\n\r\nLet's please first decide whether we want to remove fCheckPOW from this function or we want to bring the check ```block.GetBlockTime() > nAdjustedTime + MAX_FUTURE_BLOCK_TIME)``` back here (which I'm not opposed to and I'm happy to write myself if that's what's preferred, I don't care).\r\n\r\nAfter this, as @luke-jr points out CheckBlockHeader is just a wrapper for CheckProofOfWork but passing CValidationState. An option would be to remove it, another option would be to use CValidationState or maybe put it in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/script/script_error.h (and maybe rename script_error.h to consensus/errors.o too, who knows).\r\n\r\nBut if we can't decide whether fCheckPOW here is pointless or not (and I don't want to bet, but maybe the compiler has already decided for us at a lower level), I don't want to put more decisions in the same PR.\r\n\r\n@luke-jr @JeremyRubin Does that sound reasonable to you?\r\n\r\nFor more context:\r\nThe comments are really appreciated in the context of #9177 which I'm trying to complete while rewriting in a simpler and less disruptive way (it will remain on top of #8994 though, since that currently allows to reuse all existing rpc/python tests except segwit.py for any custom chain [or even testnet3 and mainchain] instead of having to replace regtest with your new testchain to do so).\r\n\r\nAt the same time, I understand neither this nor #9177 are a priority for bitcoin core itself, since I believe it is unlikely #9177 will ever be merged on mainnet unless I find a way that doesn't affect performance at all on mainchain and at the same time is not very disruptive (which as said I believe it's unlikely). It would be very useful for rebasing elements to have  #9177 completed and merged in bitcoin core, but bitcoin core shouldn't care about that since not all it's users care about elements.\r\nOn the other hand I think #8855 #8994 can be very useful for testing within bitcoin core itself, but have no relation with this PR, only with #9177.\r\n\r\nPS: Sorry for the text wall, this shouldn't happen in a +4-4 PR.",

Currently, if you're calling the function with fCheckPOW=false (could as well be named fActuallyDoSomethingWhenCallingThisFunction), you can just not call it.\r\nThis doesn't make the code more confusing, the opposite is true.\r\nAt a minimum, we could mae the nonsense argument non optional as a start.\r\n\r\n> They are conceptually different things. If we add an additional check to CheckBlockHeader, we would not expect it to also be skipped when PoW checks are skipped.\r\n\r\nThis argument actually makes sense to me.\r\nDo you have a a specific example of some check we may want to add to this function in the future or is it a \"maybe 5 years from now we realize we may want to undo this change so better not do it just in case\" kind of concern?\r\n\r\nIf you had specific examples it would be much simpler for me to close this PR.

I guess that would currently be an optimization. mhmm, didn't we used to check that block.version > 0 in ContextualCheckBlockHeader ? where are we checking it now? If in the future we want to use the \"hardfork bit\" to signal hardforks, I think  ContextualCheckBlockHeader is the right place (assuming the hf is coordinated with bip9/bip8).\r\nEDIT: never mind, it seems that check only existed in my head, it was just implicit after moving to version 2 or more.\r\n\r\nDo you have more examples? An example of something that we currently don't validate would serve.\r\nI can only think of  the \"time-too-new\" check as example, which used to be here, but since we considered that time was \"context\" anyway, I don't think we will ever put that back in CheckBlockHeader.\r\n",
