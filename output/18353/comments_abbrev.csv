MarcoFalke,2020-03-16 20:56:28,does this compile for afl?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18353#discussion_r393305716,393305716,src/test/fuzz/multiplication_overflow.cpp
practicalswift,2020-03-16 21:42:35,Yes it should :)  Let me know if you find any evidence to the contrary :),https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18353#discussion_r393326105,393326105,src/test/fuzz/multiplication_overflow.cpp
MarcoFalke,2020-03-17 17:15:19,Why implement this from scratch? Could just use `__builtin_mul_overflow`?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18353#discussion_r393840499,393840499,src/test/fuzz/util.h
practicalswift,2020-03-17 17:45:02,"I think it would be handy to have `MultiplicationOverflow(â€¦)` in other non-test parts of the code base.\n\nWhen we are confident of the equivalence between `MultiplicationOverflow` and `__builtin_mul_overflow` we can implement `MultiplicationOverflow` by using the `__builtin_mul_overflow` builtin where available (gcc + clang) and the current implementation where it is not (MSVC).\n\nThat's why",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18353#discussion_r393859416,393859416,src/test/fuzz/util.h
