sipa,2014-09-14T02:57:51Z,"@jtimon Yes indeed; this would allow #4692 to do checking without needing to depend on the cache, by using SignatureChecker() and not CachingSignatureChecker().\n\nAnd you're very right: the flags passing through CheckSig and VerifySignature is ugly, as SCRIPT_VERIFY_NOCACHE shouldn't be an interpreter flag at all, as it's no longer a feature of the interpreter.
