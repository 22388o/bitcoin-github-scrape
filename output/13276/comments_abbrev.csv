GreatSock,2018-05-18T17:58:57Z,"20px is just enough to fit the widest unit ""Amount (mBTC)"" on Ubuntu. But I'm not sure if there is some case where it doesn't fit, since different operating systems or window managers seem to have different font sizes.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13276#issuecomment-390285312,390285312,

jonasschnelli,2018-05-25T08:46:28Z,Why the extra roundtrip via `UpdateAmountHeader()` instead of just setting the header item here? Could use a comment to make it more obvious whats happening here.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13276#discussion_r190828785,190828785,src/qt/coincontroldialog.cpp
GreatSock,2018-05-25T12:55:55Z,Maybe I could rename it to something like `UpdateAmountDisplayUnit()`? I realize that `UpdateAmountHeader()` is kind of vague.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13276#discussion_r190884904,190884904,src/qt/coincontroldialog.cpp
