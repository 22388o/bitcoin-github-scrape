practicalswift,2019-10-16 21:20:44,Looks like chain selection might not be needed for these fuzzers: removed. Please re-review.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17050#discussion_r335714596,335714596,src/test/fuzz/fuzz.cpp
MarcoFalke,2019-12-09 20:43:38,how is this different from psbt.cpp?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17050#discussion_r355673701,355673701,src/test/fuzz/decode_raw_psbt.cpp
practicalswift,2019-12-10 16:36:39,"Oh, it isn't: `psbt.cpp` is a superset of this test. Removing this one :)  Good catch. Thanks!",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17050#discussion_r356146558,356146558,src/test/fuzz/decode_raw_psbt.cpp
MarcoFalke,2019-12-10 16:45:42,Can all of the things that catch those two objects be combined in a single scope (single try block)?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17050#discussion_r356152024,356152024,src/test/fuzz/parse_univalue.cpp
practicalswift,2019-12-10 19:48:22,"Say that `ParseHashV` throws -- then we still want to execute the other remaining functions below, right? If we put all functions in a single try block then the subsequent functions (such as `ParseHexO`, `ParseHexUV`, etc.) will not be executed.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17050#discussion_r356242900,356242900,src/test/fuzz/parse_univalue.cpp
