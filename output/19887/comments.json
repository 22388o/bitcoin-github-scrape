But since it's taking a bit longer to investigate and it's in dispute if this actually needs fixing, I decided to open this fix to the intermittent CI failures since they seem to occur pretty frequently. If the fix for the underlying issue is showing a better error this line will be needed anyway, if the fix makes the issue go away completely I will remove it again with #19876. So it may or may not be temporary, either way, I am just trying to mitigate the CI issue as fast as possible.",
