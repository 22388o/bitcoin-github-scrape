One comparing `nIn` with `vin.size()` (addressed by this PR), which should never occur.\n\nThere is another test, comparing `nIn` with `vout.size()` in the `SIGHASH_SINGLE` case. That one can trigger normally in the network, and is not touched by this PR.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11411#issuecomment-332994538,332994538,
