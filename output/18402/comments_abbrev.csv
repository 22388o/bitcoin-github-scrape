andronoob,2020-08-14 06:54:10,">The mapped Autonomous System used for diversifying peer selection.\n\nTo my understanding, such phrase means:\n\n""(Such number is) The Autonomous System (AS) (number, aka ASN) which this peer is mapped to (according to the map data). BGP AS is considered during peer selection, in order to diversify connected peers.
