As mentioned above, #8708 adds an assert to catch a specific form of this case (sending a post-handshake message before the handshake is complete), so a more comprehensive fix will be required for sure, and is coming as part of the disconnection logic cleanup. These two were just added because they're low-hanging fruit and are easily backported, and because they were the only ones actually observed while testing.\n",
