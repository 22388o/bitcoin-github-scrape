gmaxwell,2012-08-31T00:03:14Z,"Also, NAK, but I wanted to also thank @clopez  for taking the time to actually implement something and write a pull request, even if this particular change isn't one we want.  Generally prefer to keep functionality 'internal' rather than direct people to centralized services, and we already have a pretty good transaction detail decoder in Bitcoin (e.g. open the console and run getrawtransaction).

laanwj,2012-08-31T02:37:27Z,"It's a bit ironic, as we have all the information on every client. We could display it much faster and more secure locally, shouldn't need to link to a service such as block explorer. \n\nBut thanks for actually implementing a solution instead of complaining!\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1762#issuecomment-8181072,8181072,
clopez,2012-08-31T04:02:14Z,I see. I also think is better to keep the functionality internal.\n\nIt would be awesome if someone writes a nice GUI to show the info that btcexplorer.com or blockchain.info actually shows.\n\nI am closing this pull request. Thanks for the comments. \n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1762#issuecomment-8182100,8182100,
