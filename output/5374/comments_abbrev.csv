jgarzik,2014-11-26T13:44:09Z,You don't want to hard-code the directory into each source file.  That just implies the build needs a fix.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5374#issuecomment-64614385,64614385,
paveljanik,2014-11-26T14:00:37Z,"@jgarzik well, the current approach is to include config/bitcoin-config.h in every file except netbase.cpp and crypto/common.h which includes bitcoin-config.h. These two files were probably skipped in the past when the bitcoin-config.h was moved from src to src/config.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5374#issuecomment-64636411,64636411,
paveljanik,2014-11-26T14:27:51Z,Looks like this is a followup to #4395. netbase is fixed to match every other file in the tree. crypto needs its own fix.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5374#issuecomment-64652653,64652653,
paveljanik,2014-11-26T14:37:26Z,"My Makefile.in contains:\n\n```\n...\nDEFAULT_INCLUDES = -I. -I$(top_builddir)/src/config@am__isrc@\n...\ncrypto/crypto_libbitcoin_crypto_a-sha1.o: crypto/sha1.cpp\n@am__fastdepCXX_TRUE@   $(CXX) $(DEFS) $(DEFAULT_INCLUDES) $(INCLUDES) ...\n```\n\nSo -I. is used in crypto. But as @theuni wrote in #5340, it should not be the case. I'll leave this for @theuni once he is back.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5374#issuecomment-64654054,64654054,
