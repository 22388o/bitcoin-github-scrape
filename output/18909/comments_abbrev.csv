fanquake,2021-04-08 05:59:44,I'm going to close this. At this point we're not going to be backporting any tarball related changes to the 0.20 branch. I'll also echo the comments made in #18818; I haven't seen a single complaint/issue related to changes in the `0.20` tarball over the ~10 months since it's been released.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18909#issuecomment-815472007,815472007,
