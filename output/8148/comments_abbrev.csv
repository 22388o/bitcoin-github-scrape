jmcorgan,2016-06-06T00:47:16Z,@luke-jr It allows building the 0.12 branch using VPATH builds.  That's a major convenience for me to be able to share the same build/test scripting between master and 0.12; I expect for others as well.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8148#issuecomment-223848497,223848497,

laanwj,2016-06-06T06:12:56Z,"This could be useful to keep the testing the same. However, out-of-tree build support needs more changes for proper support. There was #7925, and one is open even now:  #8133. Backporting just that commit is not enough.\n(but it's all just build system changes, I don't think it's very risky to backport this)\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8148#issuecomment-223876188,223876188,
sipa,2016-06-06T06:16:35Z,"@jcorgan You don't need to close a PR because one person complains. Things\ncan be discussed.\n\nWe typically only backport bug fixes and soft forks to older releases, but\nperhaps it makes sense to keep the build system compatible as well.

theuni,2016-06-08T14:08:53Z,"@jmcorgan I have no problem with backporting this and a few others to make life easier, but as @laanwj said, aiming to backport fully-supported VPATH builds is probably over-reaching, given that we're still cleaning up minor things in master.\n\nAs for #7982, no, that shouldn't be backported as c++11 won't be a requirement for 0.12.x.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8148#issuecomment-224600569,224600569,

theuni,2016-06-08T16:12:42Z,"@jmcorgan The changes you have here should be enough for most basic VPATH builds, but there are several edge-cases that remain, mostly related to packaging/release stuff which we can live without in the backport.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8148#issuecomment-224642469,224642469,
