There are no\n known problems when downgrading from 0.11.x to 0.10.x.\n \n-Notable changes\n-===============\n+Notable changes since 0.11.1\n+============================\n \n-Fix buffer overflow in bundled upnp\n-------------------------------------\n+BIP65 soft fork to enforce OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY opcode\n+--------------------------------------------------------\n \n-Bundled miniupnpc was updated to 1.9.20151008. This fixes a buffer overflow in\n-the XML parser during initial network discovery.\n+This release includes several changes related to the [BIP65][] soft fork\n+which redefines the existing OP_NOP2 opcode as OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY\n+(CLTV) so that a transaction output can be made unspendable until a\n+specified point in the future.\n \n-Details can be found here: http://talosintel.com/reports/TALOS-2015-0035/\n+1. This release will only relay and mine transactions spending a CLTV\n+   output if they comply with the BIP65 rules as provided in code.\n \n-This applies to the distributed executables only, not when building from source or\n-using distribution provided packages.\n+2. This release will produce version 4 blocks by default. Please see the\n+   *notice to miners below*.\n \n-Additionally, upnp has been disabled by default. This may result in a lower\n-number of reachable nodes on IPv4, however this prevents future libupnpc\n-vulnerabilities from being a structural risk to the network\n-(see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6795).\n+3. Once 951 out of a sequence of 1,001 blocks on the local node's best block\n+   chain contain version 4 (or higher) blocks, this release will no\n+   longer accept new version 3 blocks and it will only accept version 4\n+   blocks if they comply with the BIP65 rules for CLTV.\n \n-Test for LowS signatures before relaying\n------------------------------------------\n+For more information about the soft-forking change, please see\n+<https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6351>\n \n-Make the node require the canonical 'low-s' encoding for ECDSA signatures when\n-relaying or mining.  This removes a nuisance malleability vector.\n+**Notice to miners:** Bitcoin Core\u2019s block templates are now for\n+version 4 blocks only, and any mining software relying on its\n+getblocktemplate must be updated in parallel to use libblkmaker either\n+version FIXME or any version from FIXME onward.\n \n-Consensus behavior is unchanged.\n+- If you are solo mining, this will affect you the moment you upgrade\n+  Bitcoin Core, which must be done prior to BIP65 achieving its 951/1001\n+  status.\n \n-If widely deployed this change would eliminate the last remaining known vector\n-for nuisance malleability on SIGHASH_ALL P2PKH transactions. On the down-side\n-it will block most transactions made by sufficiently out of date software.\n+- If you are mining with the stratum mining protocol: this does not\n+  affect you.\n \n-Unlike the other avenues to change txids on transactions this\n-one was randomly violated by all deployed bitcoin software prior to\n-its discovery. So, while other malleability vectors where made\n-non-standard as soon as they were discovered, this one has remained\n-permitted. Even BIP62 did not propose applying this rule to\n-old version transactions, but conforming implementations have become\n-much more common since BIP62 was initially written.\n+- If you are mining with the getblocktemplate protocol to a pool: this\n+  will affect you at the pool operator\u2019s discretion, which must be no\n+  later than BIP66 achieving its 951/1001 status.\n \n-Bitcoin Core has produced compatible signatures since a28fb70e in\n-September 2013, but this didn't make it into a release until 0.9\n-in March 2014; Bitcoinj has done so for a similar span of time.\n-Bitcoinjs and electrum have been more recently updated.\n+[BIP65]: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0065.mediawiki\n \n-This does not replace the need for BIP62 or similar, as miners can\n-still cooperate to break transactions.  Nor does it replace the\n-need for wallet software to handle malleability sanely[1]. This\n-only eliminates the cheap and irritating DOS attack.\n+BIP113 mempool-only locktime enforment using GetMedianTimePast()\n+----------------------------------------------------------------\n \n-[1] On the Malleability of Bitcoin Transactions\n-Marcin Andrychowicz, Stefan Dziembowski, Daniel Malinowski, \u0141ukasz Mazurek\n-http://fc15.ifca.ai/preproceedings/bitcoin/paper_9.pdf\n+Bitcoin transactions currently may specify a locktime indicating when\n+they may be added to a valid block.  Current consensus rules require\n+that blocks have a block header time greater than the locktime specified\n+in any transaction in that block.\n \n-Minimum relay fee default increase\n------------------------------------\n+Miners get to choose what time they use for their header time, with the\n+consensus rule being that no node will accept a block whose time is more\n+than two hours in the future.  This creates a incentive for miners to\n+set their header times to future values in order to include locktimed\n+transactions which weren't supposed to be included for up to two more\n+hours.\n \n-The default for the `-minrelaytxfee` setting has been increased from `0.00001`\n-to `0.00005`.\n+The consensus rules also specify that valid blocks may have a header\n+time greater than that of the median of the 11 previous blocks.  This\n+GetMedianTimePast() time has a key feature we generally associate with\n+time: it can't go backwards.\n \n-This is necessitated by the current transaction flooding, causing\n-outrageous memory usage on nodes due to the mempool ballooning. This is a\n-temporary measure, bridging the time until a dynamic method for determining\n-this fee is merged (which will be in 0.12).\n+[BIP113][] specifies a soft fork (**not enforced in this release**) that\n+weakens this perverse incentive for individual miners to use a future\n+time by requiring that valid blocks have a computed GetMedianTimePast()\n+greater than the locktime specified in any transaction in that block.\n \n-(see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6793, as well as the 0.11\n-release notes, in which this value was suggested)\n+Mempool inclusion rules currently require transactions to be valid for\n+immediate inclusion in a block in order to be accepted into the mempool.\n+This release begins applying the BIP113 rule to received transactions,\n+so transaction whose time is greater than the GetMedianTimePast() will\n+no longer be accepted into the mempool.\n+\n+**Implication for miners:** you may begin rejecting locktime\n+transactions that could be included under the current consensus rules.\n+Rejecting those transactions now means that you don't have to worry\n+about producing invalid blocks when BIP113 becomes consensus enforced.\n+\n+**Implication for users:** GetMedianTimePast() always trails behind the\n+current time, so a transaction locktime set to the present time will be\n+rejected by nodes running this release until the median time moves\n+forward. To compensate, subtract one hour (3,600) seconds from your\n+locktimes to allow those transactions to be included in mempools at\n+approximately the expected time.\n+\n+[BIP113]: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0113.mediawiki\n \n 0.11.1 Change log\n =================\n@@ -119,54 +140,50 @@ behavior, not code moves, refactors and string updates.
