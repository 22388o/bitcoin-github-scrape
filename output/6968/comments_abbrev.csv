sipa,2015-11-08T19:36:08Z,Perhaps it's worth mentioning that a bug which caused frequent database corruption on Windows was fixed?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6968#issuecomment-154860293,154860293,

gmaxwell,2015-11-08T20:01:08Z,"@sipa Yea, the leveldb fix change is big news for a lot of people.

petertodd,2015-11-08T21:31:08Z,ACK the BIP65 and BIP113 notes.\n\nIMO you did a better job describing the changes then I did in git master; we should probably consider copying your text when we're closer to releasing v0.12.0\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6968#issuecomment-154875889,154875889,
laanwj,2015-11-09T05:19:30Z,"Thanks for doing this!\n\nIt's a bit unfortunate that #6825 (as well as #6707) doesn't refer to the individual original pull numbers of the backported fixes. This confuses my administration - and referring to a pull like ""backport fixes"" in the release notes isn't that useful. But we can live with that, better next time.\n\n> @sipa Yea, the leveldb fix change is big news for a lot of people.

gmaxwell,2015-11-09T06:02:55Z,"@laanwj Indeed, I was mostly pointing out that there is one known common remaining source of corruption for harding's benefit, and not in any way attempting to impugn the incredible work you've done.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6968#issuecomment-154949534,154949534,

harding,2015-11-09T10:30:28Z,"@laanwj I can dig up the the original information on the backported fixes.  Can you clarify how you usually present that information?  For example, if the original PR is 1111, the original commit is `aaaaaaa`, the backport PR is 9999, and the backport commit is fffffff, how would you like that information presented:\n- (what we have now) `#9999 fffffff Commit title`\n- (all original info) `#1111 a",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6968#issuecomment-155023497,155023497,

laanwj,2015-11-09T11:21:32Z,"@harding Usually there would be no backport PR, as I cherry-pick them straight into the branch.
