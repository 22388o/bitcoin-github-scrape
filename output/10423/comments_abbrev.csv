jnewbery,2017-06-02T03:22:22Z,"Yes - this log is replacing the logs in the individual test cases (rpcbind_test.py and zmq_test.py), which are currently warnings.\n\nThe reason is that we always want the user to know if a test has been skipped.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10423#discussion_r119774182,119774182,test/functional/test_framework/test_framework.py
