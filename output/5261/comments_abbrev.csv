fanquake,2014-11-11T12:46:12Z,@sinetek I'd suggest you split the .disconnect bugfix out of this pull request.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5261#issuecomment-62541820,62541820,
sinetek,2014-11-11T21:13:52Z,I agree in principle that I shan't fix what isn't broken. This seemed a good idea at the time. I still don't like boost that much though. I'll split the bugfix out and submit.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5261#issuecomment-62621590,62621590,
theuni,2014-11-11T23:53:44Z,"As much as i dislike boost, agreed on not changing it without good reason. However, this might be worth revisiting after a move to c++11, since that opens the door to several other lightweight implementations.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5261#issuecomment-62643877,62643877,
laanwj,2014-11-12T15:44:43Z,"I'm completely sick of this ""I don't like boost"". Not liking boost doesn't mean that any random library or hand-rolled alternative is better. We also don't want to maintain every single thing as part of Bitcoin Core. There's a reason that utility libraries exist. Closing.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5261#issuecomment-62738566,62738566,
