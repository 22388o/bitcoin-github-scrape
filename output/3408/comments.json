There were several suggestions for names but at a certain point it was settled at \"Bitcoin Core\" (just too much shed painting I hope you understand my revulsion to repeating that...).\n\nSure, this \"marketing\" name can be confused with other things that might be cores of bitcoin, hey at least we didn't call it \"Coinbase\" or \"Blockchain\"...  There is just no name that everyone can agree on.\n\nSo please: let me know if I missed something, but not if you don't like the name.\n",
