However for the sake of the argument: I locally have a version which is an about 3x smaller diff, and regarding adding a field to the CTxMempoolEntry it's necessary anyway as to use weight-mesured feerates we need to track, well, the weight of the tx.\r\n\r\nI agree it needs more conceptual feedback, but i don't want to ask for it before this patchset is reworked (will push soon :tm: ) as i think the boutique approach here could degrade the conceptual review.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, thank you for your interest.",
