gwillen,2019-05-08 21:27:25,"So the only reason I didn't write it this way, is that people have said they don't want private keys to be echoed in the output.\n\nPersonally I think this is fine -- the only way to get a private key in the output, is if you include it in the input. And in fact, there has to be SOME way to get private keys echoed back, if you want to be able to get checksums for descriptors with private keys in",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15986#issuecomment-490657223,490657223,

Sjors,2019-05-12 12:32:42,"Concept ACK.\n\nLight preference for returning only the checksum rather than echoing a private key. But I do agree with @gwillen's point: \n>the only way to get a private key in the output, is if you include it in the input.\n\nI find the extra  `with_checksum` confusing. Maybe we can add an argument `keep_private_keys` which defaults to `false`.
