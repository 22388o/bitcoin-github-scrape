It is not our goal to support every edge use-case.

jonasschnelli,2018-01-18T19:35:58Z,"I agree with @MarcoFalke. `sendtoaddress` is a simple send command where you don't even have control over how much fee you have to pay (single shot) and I don't think we should add more ""expert"" functions there.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11489#issuecomment-358757594,358757594,

This desire to keep `sendtoaddress` dumb to ""not confuse users"" is itself confusing to me.
