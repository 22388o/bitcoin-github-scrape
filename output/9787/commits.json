See below for more details.\n+- In some cases, compact blocks are now relayed before being fully validated as\n+  per BIP152.\n+- P2P networking has been refactored with a focus on concurrency and\n+  throughput. Network operations are no longer bottlenecked by validation. As a\n+  result, block fetching is several times faster than previous releases in many\n+  cases.\n+- The UTXO cache now claims unused mempool memory. This speeds up initial block\n+  download as UTXO lookups are a major bottleneck there, and there is no use for\n+  the mempool at that stage.\n+\n+\n Manual Pruning\n --------------\n "
