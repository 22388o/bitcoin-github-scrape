laanwj,2015-06-16T13:05:01Z,This is getting so incredibly complex. I'm afraid this will seem to fix issues but only add more edge cases (on some platforms). Do we really need all this code for every window? Are you sure we're not just mis-configuring something in Qt? Do other projects do this too?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6288#issuecomment-112419952,112419952,
Diapolo,2015-06-16T13:09:57Z,"A simple `show()` in the slot is not working, try for yourself. I also thought about at least having such a function in GUIUtil, but then we have problems with the signal/slot stuff as a widget id/pointer would be needed in `showNormalIfMinimized()`. Yes it's getting more complex, but fixes an UX issue. I'll try to see if we can do something better.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6288#issuecomment-112422011,112422011,

laanwj,2015-06-18T14:29:41Z,"Indeed, this at least needs a clear list of steps to reproduce the problem. Otherwise I'd rather avoid it.
