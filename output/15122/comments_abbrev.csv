ryanofsky,2019-01-08T16:11:13Z,"This would be great documentation to add to importmulti help, but it's a bad release note because it tells you almost nothing about how the new behavior is different than the old behavior, and it sounds like everything described is new when in reality most of it is unchanged, and most existing uses of importmulti should be unaffected.\n\nA better release note would be a simple bulleted list of c",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15122#issuecomment-452355436,452355436,
