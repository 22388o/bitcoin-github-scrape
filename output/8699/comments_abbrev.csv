laanwj,2016-09-13T09:19:05Z,I'm a bit confused by the description. Is this only for 0.13.1? Should this be merged into master/0.14 at all?\n\n> It should be disabled on mainnet\n\nDoes it have value on testnet/regtest?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8699#issuecomment-246624024,246624024,

jl2012,2016-09-13T10:12:46Z,"I think it should never be allowed on mainnet. In principle we should not generate any address that may likely be unspendable.\n\nAlso, I don't think it's very useful for testing. It is not used by any RPC test, and a witness address could be generated trivially with python. \n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8699#issuecomment-246636955,246636955,

However, we only now realized that it's\npretty dangerous as it can't guarantee the returned address is valid. Maybe\nit's still useful, but it at least needs a big warning.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8699#issuecomment-246711160,246711160,
