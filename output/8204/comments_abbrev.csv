petertodd,2016-06-15T04:19:41Z,"FYI I have no plans to take down the old testnet seed anytime soon, and the two are running on separate servers to avoid having the new servicebits stuff cause any issues. This seed's service bit whitelist is also setup to return the RBF bit, and there will be an analogous mainnet version of it on seed.btc.petertodd.org shortly.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8204#issuecomment-226084217,226084217,
jonasschnelli,2016-06-15T07:24:05Z,`dig A x9.seed.tbtc.petertodd.org` results in a list with 23 IPs (I think we have only a handful [even less] of SW nodes).\nTook out an random IP (139.59.169.37) and checked the service bits (00000005).\n\nI guess seed.tbtc.petertodd.org runs still the bitcoin-seeder without filter support?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8204#issuecomment-226108652,226108652,
petertodd,2016-06-15T16:15:24Z,"@jonasschnelli Huh, weird, it's _definitely_ running the seeder with filter support, no doubt about that. Maybe the seeder has a bug? Or those aren't actually real nodes? The seed was just started for the first time earlier today if that means anything.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8204#issuecomment-226238916,226238916,

petertodd,2016-06-23T10:10:56Z,"@laanwj Go ahead and merge; the possible issue @jonasschnelli would be only on my end, and any fix for it would require no changes to Bitcoin Core's codebase.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8204#issuecomment-228007082,228007082,
