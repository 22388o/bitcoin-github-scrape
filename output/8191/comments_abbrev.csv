laanwj,2016-06-27T12:25:03Z,I'm not sure promoting these return values up to the function scope is a good idea. Keeping the scope of variables as small as possible ensures that results won't leak or accidentally influence other things.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8191#discussion_r68566917,68566917,src/wallet/db.cpp
paveljanik,2016-06-27T12:38:44Z,"Technically speaking, this is not directly function scope.\n\nBut yes, one view is to have only one return value variable, the other is one return value variable per function call.\n\nRenaming `ret` to `ret1` here could make this particular change smaller.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8191#discussion_r68568622,68568622,src/wallet/db.cpp
laanwj,2016-06-27T12:44:28Z,"Yes, I'd prefer just renaming\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8191#discussion_r68569407,68569407,src/wallet/db.cpp
paveljanik,2016-06-27T12:58:11Z,Done and squashed - now all the changes are of the same kind.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8191#discussion_r68571214,68571214,src/wallet/db.cpp
