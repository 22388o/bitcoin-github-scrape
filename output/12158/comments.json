Given I'm a CMake guy, I couldn't figure out how to get around that so what I did was I hacked Bear.\r\n\r\nBasically I added the following line to /usr//bin/bear. \r\n\r\n250         re.compile(r'^libtool: compile :  clang(\\+\\+)?(-\\d+(\\.\\d+){0,2})?$'),\r\n\r\nAnd of course ran ./configure with CC=\"clang\"\r\nAnd bear make V=1\r\n\r\nHope that helps. Ideally this would be integrated in the buildsystem, CMake already provides support for compilation databases.\r\n\r\nI also tried to just pass CC=clang-tidy at configure time but that fails since IIRC in univalue the configure step tries to compile something to see if there's support and that messes everything up.
