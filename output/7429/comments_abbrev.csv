jonasschnelli,2016-01-27T20:36:29Z,Hmm... importance is relative.\nThe wallet (so wallet & pruning) is probably not the most relevant topic. Mempool limitation and opt-in RBF are – IMO – far more relevant for the 0.12 release.\nI tend to keep the current order.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7429#issuecomment-175842733,175842733,

But both are expert usecases. \nThe wallet on the other hand is a non-technical, non-expert usecase. And we can assume that the average user is not an expert who does highly technical stuff.

MarcoFalke,2016-01-27T22:00:44Z,"I agree with @jonasschnelli: Importance is hard to evaluate so that everyone agrees. Some sections could be reordered but I think we don't want to create merge conflicts with other release note pull either.\n\nI'd rather keep the current order, as the release notes are already referred to from other places and reordering could potentially destroy references.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7429#issuecomment-175882133,175882133,
