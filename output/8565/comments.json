    "body": "Not .gitignoring emacs specialities in a project which doesn't depend on emacs makes sense to me. However, vi's `.*.swp` files and backups currently are in `.gitignore`. Removing them for consistency is probably not worth it.\nThe `TAGS ETAGS` etc. files can be created by the project's `Makefile` as it is now, otherwise I wouldn't have bothered in the first place. However, TAGS-support seems to be automatically provided by automake, unlike lcov-support which looked similar and whose artifacts are in `.gitignore`, but was explicitly added to `configure.ac`.\n\nThus, I'll rescind this pull request. Should you change your mind, the changes are trivial to recreate.\n",
