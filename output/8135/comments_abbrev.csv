droark,2016-08-02T00:17:33Z,"Ahhh, I just stumbled across this issue today. Glad to see that people are looking into it.\n\nHaving looked at the proposed solutions, I think theuni's proposal that ds_store and mac_alias be pulled into the repo is reasonable. They're ~1300 lines of Python code each. Not tiny but quite manageable.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8135#issuecomment-236751055,236751055,
