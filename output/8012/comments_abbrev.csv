jonasschnelli,2016-05-06T09:18:21Z,@Tyler-Hardin Not sure if wait cursors are still make since today (haven't seem them on my OSX system a while ago IIRC). But it would be better then noting.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8012#issuecomment-217394267,217394267,
MarcoFalke,2016-05-06T09:25:20Z,"Agree with @jonasschnelli. Today, changing the mouse icon is not a thing to do anymore. Instead, the spinner/clock icon is displayed in place (inside the button).

I had left it in because the button shrinks when it goes away. No style. (I'm guessing you're hinting that I could prevent the shrink with a well designed style.

Tyler-Hardin,2016-05-06T08:59:05Z,"@jonasschnelli, I don't think it's possible to invalidate a singleShot. There's never any timer exposed for me to invalidate. It functions like the static QMessageBox::info/warning/etc functions.\n\nI would expect that Qt planned for the possibility of the connected object disappearing, seeing as it could happen often.
