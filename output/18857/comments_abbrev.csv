Saving same verbosity is nice, but the downsides are now having a macro that obscures what's happening, and is applied inconsistently throughout configure; less than half of our `AX_CHECK_COMPILE_FLAG` calls are replaced with it.\n\nThis approach would also not work with the change currently proposed in #18882 (we'd end up with duplicate `-Wformat` flags).
