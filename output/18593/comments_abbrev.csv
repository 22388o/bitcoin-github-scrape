MarcoFalke,2020-04-11 13:10:36,"style-nit: I slightly prefer the interface where the hash is passed in as a hex string, as opposed to a plain integer. The integer is less type safe and could be confused with other args such as timeout. Also, putting the burden on the caller to always call `int()` makes tests slightly harder to write.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18593#discussion_r407062253,407062253,test/functional/p2p_filter.py
theStack,2020-04-11 13:21:44,"I fully agree, but then for consistency reasons all three methods `wait_for_{header,block,merkleblock}` should have the same interface and be changed to take a hex string accordingly?
