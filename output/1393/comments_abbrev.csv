luke-jr,2012-06-19T16:18:12Z,So got around to testing... all my transactions are showing a smart time of 1 (01/01/1970 00:00). Guess I have some fixing to do.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1393#issuecomment-6429740,6429740,

laanwj,2012-07-17T09:43:02Z,"ACK\n\nRe:Qt, sorting transactions by time sorts the transactions by time, nothing else. Anything else would be confusing IMO. The only thing that can be sensibly changed is the 'default' order, when not explicitly sorting by anything. In the transaction details we can show all the different times.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1393#issuecomment-7030895,7030895,
