sipa,2013-03-28T16:55:32Z,"Ok, fixed an obscure bug: ProcessMessages (while holding cs_vRecvMsg) sometimes calls PushMessage, which since Jeff's patches sometimes calls SocketSendData, which can fail and cause the connection to be closed. Closing the connection however wipes vRecvMsg... while ProcessMessages is still iterating over it, invalidating its iterator, and eventually trying to remove the entries it already process",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2409#issuecomment-15600195,15600195,
sipa,2013-03-29T22:59:24Z,"Added a commit, which breaks up the processing of getdata requests when the send buffer size limit is exceeded. This results in far smaller send buffers being allocated for peers downloading blocks from us, and doesn't seem to have a noticable impact on performance/bandwidth (I can still download blocks from my VPS running this, at ~6 MiB/s, same as before).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2409#issuecomment-15664665,15664665,
