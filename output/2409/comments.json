Closing the connection however wipes vRecvMsg... while ProcessMessages is still iterating over it, invalidating its iterator, and eventually trying to remove the entries it already processed, causing a double free.\n\nSeems to be running smoothly now.\n",

It adds/modifies tests which test network rules (thanks for doing that), which conflicts with a patch applied at test time\n3. It does not build on either Linux i386 or Win32 (via MinGW cross compile)\n4. The test suite fails on either Linux i386 or Win32\n5. The block test-cases failed (lookup the first bNN identifier which failed in https://github.com/TheBlueMatt/test-scripts/blob/master/FullBlockTestGenerator.java)\n\nIf you believe this to be in error, please ping BlueMatt on freenode or TheBlueMatt here.\n\nThis is an automated test script which runs test cases on each commit every time is updated.\nIt, however, dies sometimes and fails to test properly, if you are waiting on a test, please check timestamps and if the test.log is moving at http://jenkins.bluematt.me/pull-tester/current/\nand contact BlueMatt on freenode if something looks broken.\n",
