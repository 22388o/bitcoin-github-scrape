    "body": "Commenting because I see this is in next-test.  I think this is a bad idea, in fact,  because its possible to make a typo that currently fails which this corrects to an incorrect passing one.   e.g. you type O instead if P  (the keys are next to each other) and it corrects to o which happens to pass the crc check.  If people are being sloppy in their typing it would be better to find out about it rather than being silently corrected.\n",
