I think the current mismatching fonts just clutter and confuse.\n\n\n> @za-kk btw, what is Qt version on your macOS?

dannmat,2020-03-14 14:30:54,Concept ACK. Using Bitcoin Core currently feels very messy compared to other software. I think we should be keeping user experience in mind and graphical consistencies like this will go a long way.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18313#issuecomment-599069704,599069704,

laanwj,2020-03-19 14:55:46,"> Concept ~0.\n> I'd prefer to use monospaced fonts to display bitcoin addresses.\n\nSame TBH. I like having it in a different font to distinguish addresses from other text. Note that some other wallets do this too when displaying addresses.\n\nI'm all for accessibility but I don't think this is really an improvement.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18313#issuecomment-601225376,601225376,
