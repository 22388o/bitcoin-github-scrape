vasild,2020-08-18 17:11:30,"@jonatack to observe the effect of this either run with `-onlynet=onion` (as you did) or run a normal node without any special arguments - no tor proxy, just IPv4/IPv6 connectivity. This will flag TOR addresses as unreachable.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19728#issuecomment-675603951,675603951,
sipa,2020-08-18 17:12:38,@jonatack I wouldn't expect to see observable differences from just one node doing this. The problem is that *other* nodes don't relay your onion addresses well unless they're on Tor themselves. Change will require widespread deployment.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19728#issuecomment-675604491,675604491,
