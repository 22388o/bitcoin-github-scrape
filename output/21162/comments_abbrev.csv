ajtowns,2021-03-04 11:59:11,"Hmm, I *think* this should be marked as `const` ? Even after `setInventoryTxToSend` is moved into `Peer`, updating that doesn't change `PeerManagerImpl`, only the contents of an object which `PeerManagerImpl` has a `shared_ptr` to. For better or worse `const` on a class only protects its pointers from changes, it doesn't protect the things pointed to from changing.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21162#discussion_r587410937,587410937,src/net_processing.h
