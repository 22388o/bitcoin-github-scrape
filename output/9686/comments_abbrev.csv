laanwj,2017-02-04T10:33:18Z,"Concept ACK. Though to avoid too many intermediate steps it would make sense to make this part of a larger refactor to make the RPC help easier machine-readable. This would make it possible to generate man-pages, wiki pages, etc maybe even simple language bindings from the same source as the ""online"" RPC help.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9686#issuecomment-277434335,277434335,
