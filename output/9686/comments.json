(I'm trying to look at any tools that have a CLI similar to bitcoin-cli (multiple commands, not just options) but can't think of a lot of them, for some reason. Ideas welcome to make this comment more encompassing.)\r\n\r\n* Git simply has Documentation/git-[command].txt files, each one being a manpage. See e.g. https://github.com/git/git/blob/35f6318d44379452d8d33e880d8df0267b4a0cd0/Documentation/git-diff.txt\r\n* HomeBrew (macOS package manager) keeps documentation in the source code using special formatting, and then parses that on the fly: https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/Library/Homebrew/cmd/help.rb#L76\r\n* RubyGems (`gem` command) seems to use something similar to HomeBrew but less fancy, e.g.: https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/blob/master/lib/rubygems/commands/build_command.rb\r\n",
