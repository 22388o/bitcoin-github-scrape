laanwj,2015-11-02T11:31:56Z,Agree re: Initialize/Shutdown. As Initialize is always immediately called after the constructor and Shutdown before the destructor it makes little sense to require these to be called explicitly (and have it possible for the object to be in 'created but uninitialized' state.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6927#issuecomment-152994103,152994103,

jonasschnelli,2015-11-03T19:28:34Z,Codereview ACK.\nMakes sense to use the destructor instead `init.cpp` pollution. This also fixes a possible tiny-shutdown-only memory leak in case of something went wrong during initialization.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6927#issuecomment-153462340,153462340,
