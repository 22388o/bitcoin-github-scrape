fanquake,2021-05-08 02:50:11,@S3RK You might be interested in this. ,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21880#issuecomment-834998030,834998030,
S3RK,2021-05-10 19:08:28,Updating descriptors by removing SPKmanager from the map and creating a new one has been shown to be problematic â€” see #19651. I'd suggest to review #19651 as it removes the code it question altogether and it had one ACK already. ,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21880#issuecomment-837167960,837167960,
achow101,2021-05-10 20:44:31,Agree with @S3RK that we should focus on #19651 which removes this code and replaces it with proper updating that also happens to not call `GetScriptPubKeyMan` a bunch.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21880#issuecomment-837311316,837311316,
fanquake,2021-05-10 22:55:11,Going to close this in favour of #19651. @klementtan would you like to review that PR instead?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21880#issuecomment-837459563,837459563,
klementtan,2021-05-11 00:05:08,Agreed. #19651 is a better solution than this. Will take a look at it.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21880#issuecomment-837526220,837526220,
