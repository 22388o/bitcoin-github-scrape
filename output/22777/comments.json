    "body": "> If I understand it correctly, the problem solved here is that our feeler peer might assemble/send out unnecessary tx announcements in the short time before they notice that they got disconnected.\r\n\r\nNot quite. The `fRelay` field in the `version` message indicates whether the peer should announce new unconfirmed transactions to us (https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0037.mediawiki#extensions-to-existing-messages). When we open a feeler connection to a peer, we obviously don't want it to announce txs to us, since we're going to disconnect as soon as we receive their `version` message.\r\n\r\nThis PR is maybe better understood when considered alongside #22778, where we'll save having to allocate the `TxRelay` data structure when receiving inbound connections with `fRelay` set to `0`.\r\n\r\n> Aren't tx invs are just one of several unnecessary messages? e.g. we also send them an GETADDR before disconnecting, so that they might prepare an answer which we'll never receive. So I wonder if a more general solution would make sense. (would it maybe work to skip sending VERACK to feelers?)\r\n\r\nI agree that we probably shouldn't send `getaddr`, `sendaddrv2` and `wtxidrelay` to the peer. I'm not sure about skipping `verack`. Those changes could happen in a separate PR.",

    "body": "Thanks for the reviews @amitiuttarwar @ShubhamPalriwala @naumenkogs \r\n\r\n> trying to wrap my head around not acquiring the CSemaphoreGrant / having a limit to the amount of feelers we open from the tests...\r\n\r\n@amitiuttarwar - I don't understand this. In `CConnman::AddConnection()` we always try to acquire a semaphore grant before calling `OpenNetworkConnection()`. If that TryAcquire fails, then we return false and the rpc throws.\r\n\r\n> I'm quite unsure as to why we are removing the limit of Feeler connections in the tests?\r\n\r\n@ShubhamPalriwala - I also don't understand this. There have never been any limits on the number of feelers, so this PR doesn't remove a limit. In normal operation, the number of feelers is implicitly limited because we'll only open them every 2 minutes on average, and the connections are short-lived. However, there's never been a hard limit on the number of feelers, and this PR doesn't propose to add one.\r\n\r\n> One thing I was thinking about is whether someone in the future would want to rely on fRelay=1 to distinguish whether a peer is tx-relaying or not (e.g. SPV-readonly), e.g. to populate addrman.\r\n\r\n@naumenkogs - I think this is already impossible. Bitcoin Core will set fRelay=0 for block-relay-only connections. You can't interpret from fRelay=0 on a certain connection that the peer doesn't relay transactions at all, just that it doesn't want to receive transactions on this connection.",

    "body": "> nit: Doesn't this mean we won't request tx relay, but are (theoretically) still happy to process them?\r\n\r\nNo. For feeler connections, we disconnect as soon as we receive the `version` message, and we don't process any other message types before receiving `version`, so it's not possible for us to process any incoming transactions or announcements.\r\n\r\n> Wouldn't it be better if this check here wasn't needed and m_tx_relay was never initialized?\r\n\r\nI agree that it'd be better if `m_tx_relay` wasn't initialized until we receive the `version` message, and have implemented that in #22778. However, I don't think that's relevant here. For outbound peers, `PushNodeVersion` is sent _before_ receiving the `version` message, so this check can't be dependent on whether `m_tx_relay` has been initialized.",
