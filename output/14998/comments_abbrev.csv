MarcoFalke,2019-01-15T16:57:36Z,"I think even if it compiles, the compiler couldn't enforce the lock annotations for lambdas anyway, since they could be used across compilation units?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14998#discussion_r247977598,247977598,src/validation.cpp
Empact,2019-01-31T22:18:31Z,"I'm not sure the implication, but I think this is good - `EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED(cs_main)` is also enforced via the `CChainState::LoadBlockIndex` declaration, and `AssertLockHeld` looks into `g_lockstack`, which is built up in the usual way. We could perhaps do without `AssertLockHeld` given the `LoadBlockIndex` declaration. Thoughts?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14998#discussion_r252863854,252863854,src/validation.cpp
