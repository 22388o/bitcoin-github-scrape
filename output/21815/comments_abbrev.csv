If you are asking about usecase for `maxoutfullrelay=0`, below are two examples:\n\nExample 1: User wants to have 2 Block Relay outbound connections and 1 Full Relay outbound connection with his other node\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13405205/116729652-09bef500-aa05",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21815#issuecomment-830246614,830246614,
amitiuttarwar,2021-04-30 20:31:25,"I also don't understand _why_ a user would want to reduce the number of outbound connections- having multiple connections to the network is fundamental to safety against eclipse attacks. If a user configured the node to only have outbound block-relay-only connections, they wouldn't be participating in addr relay, so wouldn't have a diverse addrman to identify candidates to connect to.

Default is 8 and number of outbound full relay connections can only be reduced by power users who normally experiment with different options in `bitcoin.conf`\n2.

If you have a trusted node that's already well connected, there is no need to make more connections yourself.\n\n3) What different needs do people have? You can say care more about bandwidth or computing resources, but if that's the case, they can just reduce the number of connections.
