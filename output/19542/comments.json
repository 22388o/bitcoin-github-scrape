(Assuming no other changes to the pulls in question happened in the meantime).\r\n\r\nAs to the conceptual discussion, I think everyone agrees with @theuni that connman should be treated as an optional pointer. In current master, connman is a pointer (and it is not trivially possible to make it a non-pointer). https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/c04485850e72e773280e0cc8d88e73ec791bef73/src/node/context.h#L36\r\nAlso, places where connman could be nullptr properly check for that. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/c04485850e72e773280e0cc8d88e73ec791bef73/src/rpc/mining.cpp#L640-L642\r\n\r\nHowever, the lines changed by the patch are called only where connman is already confirmed to be not null. If we go ahead to merge this, it would be good to document in the code or somewhere else why those cases should be treated as pointers and, at the same time, why nullptr checks are not needed for them. \r\n\r\nACK 1aff21b36450644390d6361d496811dda5a6ae31 for now. I only checked that it cleanly reverts, but ideally we'd have clear documentation on how to pass connman around and why. Sorry for causing this disagreement in the first place. I wish the time spent on this was used on user-facing changes, but properly documenting this will hopefully avoid misunderstandings in the future.",

When I wrote my ACK I originally had a comment about not merging immediately because of conflicts, but I deleted that because I didn't want to tell the maintainers how to do their job\r\n[16:46] <MarcoFalke> when merging I do check all conflicts for reviews, and in this case, all of the conflicts had either, no review, didn't compile, or didn't pass the test suite.

    "body": "Concept NACK :p\r\n\r\nLooking in more detail now, it's clear that I jumped to an incorrect conclusion in #19174. My apologies to @theStack for a review so shallow it proved harmful. I'll make sure that future NACKs come with a more thorough review.\r\n\r\nI agree with @jnewbery's assessment here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19174#issuecomment-658627037.\r\n\r\nAs a note on process, I rather appreciate the way this worked out. Bad reviews should be called out as such (as @MarcoFalke and @jnewbery did), and worrisome merges should be pointed out for discussion (as @JeremyRubin did), even if ultimately no further action is taken. Though one might argue that I was so off-base on my argument that @MarcoFalke was right not to sit around and wait for me to figure it out :)\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone for being reasonable. Sorry for the noise!",
