practicalswift,2018-11-09T13:58:36Z,"Concept ACK\n\nGood idea!\n\n@lucash-dev Would you be able to match other CVE:s against tests and include them in this PR? That would be really useful to have. It would be nice to be able to do `git grep CVE-N` on all issued Bitcoin Core CVE:s to be able to find the corresponding test case and/or fix\n\nPerhaps Bitcoin CVE guru @luke-jr can help in this matching? :-)",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14696#issuecomment-437367200,437367200,
