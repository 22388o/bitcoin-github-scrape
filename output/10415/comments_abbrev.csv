fanquake,2017-05-18T08:44:38Z,"I'm currently seeing no speedup when using this new code. I'm wondering if it's because I have to run with AFL_NO_FORKSRV on OS X (I haven't been able to make afl-fuzz run without it being set) ?\n\nOr does this require using [afl-clang-fast and afl-clang-fast++](https://github.com/mirrorer/afl/tree/master/llvm_mode) in place of afl-clang and afl-clang++ to see the speed improvements?\n\nI'm s",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10415#issuecomment-302340791,302340791,
practicalswift,2017-05-18T09:08:24Z,@fanquake The binary you created is not instrumented correctly (the messages `Persistent mode binary detected` and `Deferred forkserver binary detected` are missing). You're correct that the instrumentation needed for this speedup requires using `afl-clang-fast` and `afl-clang-fast++` in place of `afl-clang` and `afl-clang++`. See https://github.com/mirrorer/afl/tree/master/llvm_mode for details :,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10415#issuecomment-302346603,302346603,
