laanwj,2012-09-06T05:38:44Z,"Agreed, bitmask arithmethic should be unsigned. Subsequent bit shifting can otherwise result in signed int overflows which are undefined in C(++).

Still a useful precaution, though.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1793#discussion_r1541120,1541120,src/netbase.cpp
