laanwj,2013-09-28T07:49:46Z,I'm not so sure about this. I'd like it to show the merchant's specified information at least in the payment form. When will this be triggered? The merchant shouldn't be reusing addresses in the first place for _secure_ payments.\n\nAlso how does this fit into avoiding address reuse and deprecating the address book into a list of historically used addresses? We should not provide any special conve,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2994#issuecomment-25293759,25293759,
Diapolo,2013-09-28T13:28:33Z,"@laanwj This change just ensures that address labels, that ARE in our address book are shown, when using a normal bitcoin: URI or insecure payments. And because of that ensures we don't overwrite labels in the users address book.\n\nSo for secure payments there is no change at all, we will see the merchant displayed and no address or label in the sendcoinsdialog.

It's also fine to not recognize it's an address that is in your addressbook?\n\nThe other way around, if an URI doesn't specify a label currently our addressbook isn't even searched for a label ;).
