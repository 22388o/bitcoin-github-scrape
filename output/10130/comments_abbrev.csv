jnewbery,2017-03-30T22:08:44Z,"@theuni has suggested that checking the stderr for error text may cause problems due to unicode, eols, etc, and that we'd be better off defining our own exit codes in bitcoin-tx and testing on those. I think it's ok to test for text in stderr for now, but we a future PR should define exit codes and test them in bctest.py.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10130#issuecomment-290559480,290559480,
laanwj,2017-03-31T06:15:56Z,"I don't disagree with @theuni on that in general, however checking for text in error messages is perfectly fine for tests that are supposed to test these errors. Especially for a user-facing tool. We do a similar thing for checking e.g. RPC errors where we check both the code and the message.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10130#issuecomment-290626637,290626637,

theuni,2017-03-31T07:00:40Z,"As mentioned in the comments: for reference, I suggested using exit codes rather than comparing text because (here specifically), Wine piles nonsense about window creation into stderr when running without DISPLAY set. For that reason, we can't test that ""stderr == expected"", rather we have to test ""expected in stderr"". That's not great, but it's not a huge deal either.\n\nutACK 19ecd1e2e13514c8a",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10130#issuecomment-290633289,290633289,
