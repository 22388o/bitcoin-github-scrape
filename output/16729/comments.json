    "body": "IMO Open/Close Wallet look too much alike. On my text editor, close file has a document (no folder) with an X in the corner - but not sure if that's appropriate for a wallet.\r\n\r\nThe 'i' for Command-line options was hard to make out. I think it's too much serif for the size?\r\n\r\nFrom the main window (ie, not system-wide menu), Restore/Main Window seem like no-ops. I'm not sure how to best detect that, but it seems outside the scope of this PR. For icon-making purposes: Restore would un-minimise / bring to front, and Main Window would switch to the main window specifically.\r\n\r\nSending/Receiving addresses are too hard to differentiate. Maybe fill in the arrows and make them simpler?",

That's why I think cut harsh, save everyone's time, is the right approach.  \r\n\r\n> Furthermore, macOS isn't all that popular throughout the world, I believe.\r\n\r\nTotally. I just responded to @emilengler statement that icons are *necessary* for accessibility which IMO is wrong.\r\n\r\n>  There are other ways to contribute like translations :)\r\n\r\nWhat really would be awesome if someone would take care of good UX. I don't mean changing a bunch of icons... I more mean thinking the whole thing through, starting with a great concept, etc.",

I only said that it's not true that you need Icon for accessibility and made an example about macOS.\r\n\r\nWe removed the menu icons in #16612. We had 7 acks for that. Working on bringing them back is extremely likely a waste of time...  up to you if you want to continue on this... but I strongly recommend to not waste precious contributors time.",

    "body": "@luke-jr i'm not sure about theme-provided icons - honestly, this is out of my depth. From what I understand, adding some theme icons would not be practical, as it would require additional code and work.\r\nThere'd also be problems with finding a theme that matches the current icons - unless we change every icon. Meanwhile, filling those arrows and replacing \"i\" for command line options wouldnt be hard at all. Not sure about open/close wallet.\r\n\r\n@jonasschnelli I wasn't targeting you specifically. Working on the icons only to see the PR closed is a waste of time, can't argue with that. But merging this would also end the time-waste - as for the other reasons for not having icons, I can't say I agree with any of them (especially since most(?) ACKs were from people who don't have icons on their menus)",
