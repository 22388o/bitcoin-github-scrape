gavinandresen,2014-05-30T15:27:34Z,"NAK. In my opinion, GetOpName should return ""OP_UNKNOWN"" for the template-matching pseudo-opcodes (they are not real opcodes).\n\nBecause GetOpName is used for human-readable decoding of Scripts, and if 0xf9 appears in a Script then it would be less confusing for it to appear as OP_UNKNOWN rather than OP_SMALLDATA.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4260#issuecomment-44663760,44663760,
sipa,2014-05-30T15:35:31Z,Agree with Gavin.\n\nThe fact that we use pseudo opcodes for template matching is an implementation-specific hack.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4260#issuecomment-44664753,44664753,
4tar,2014-05-30T16:04:27Z,"@gavinandresen @sipa Got your point.  The current code has already give op name for 3 of 5 template matching code (OP_PUBKEYHASH / OP_PUBKEY / OP_SMALLDATA) while leave the other 2 out (OP_PUBKEYS / OP_SMALLINTEGER), do we prefer to change all 5 to be OP_UNKNOWN in GetOpName() or just keep it the current way?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4260#issuecomment-44668041,44668041,
gavinandresen,2014-05-30T17:12:30Z,"I'd suggest removing the three that are there now and replacing them with a\ncomment:\n\n// Note: OP_SMALLDATA/etc are not real opcodes.
