sipsorcery,2020-03-11 16:16:46,"I don't think this will compile on x86 Windows. \n\nThe `PSIZE_T` output parameters use `SIZE_T` which has a different definition for x86 and x64. `SIZE_T` is equivalent to `std::size_t` for x64 but not x86. The fix is to use `SIZE_T` instead but that introduces an additional Windows specific type.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17494#issuecomment-597727635,597727635,

I think logging a warning and returning 0 is good enough, but right now this will potentially return an invalid or uninitialized value in the case of an error.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17494#discussion_r347402384,347402384,src/support/lockedpool.cpp
