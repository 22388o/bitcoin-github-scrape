gmaxwell,2015-11-14T05:48:45Z,"Tested ACK.. but a question:  are people going to get confused when they see median time in getblock output, but the nlock time thats enforced there is the mediantimepast?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7011#issuecomment-156638758,156638758,

petertodd,2015-11-14T18:13:33Z,"@gmaxwell They probably will be. OTOH, they can always check the mediantime for the previous block. Also, this way avoids the special case for the genesis block.\n\nedit: Also, if it's the mediantimepast, how do I get the mediantime for the current block? I'd have to special-case calling getblockchaininfo, and that might refer to a newer block than I was expecting.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7011#issuecomment-156729859,156729859,
