A no results in an exit... and a exception thrown at shutdown.\n\nThe reason is that Shutdown() isn't called if AppInit2() exits in an abnormal way, and thus ThreadScriptCheckQuit() isn't called, thus the script check threads just keep running.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2315#issuecomment-13678609,13678609,
sipa,2013-02-17T22:28:33Z,"@gavinandresen I added a very simple destructor to CCheckQueue that calls Quit(), which should take care of taking down the sigcheck threads during shutdown.\n\nI have no explanation for your assert error, though.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2315#issuecomment-13698379,13698379,
