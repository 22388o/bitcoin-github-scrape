gavinandresen,2011-09-20T15:48:13Z,"This seems like a perfect candidate for some unit tests, both for the base64 encoder/decoder and for the sign/verify.\n\nA performance unit-test for the old versus new base64 code would be spiffy, too...\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/524#issuecomment-2146400,2146400,
ByteCoin,2011-09-21T00:48:17Z,I suggest that the code from https://github.com/sipa/bitcoin/commit/6e223c405988a1002eeeee69db88a1128a38b0a3 be used to recover the public key from the ECDSA signature on verification. This means that the public key need not be base-64 encoded which makes signatures about 87 characters shorter. The verification step is simply to check that the inferred public key matches the address. See https://b,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/524#issuecomment-2151521,2151521,
