laanwj,2013-01-26T16:36:29Z,I personally don't really like buttons appearing/disappearing while typing (causing layout changes). It might be better to use enable/disable?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2219#issuecomment-12737735,12737735,
schildbach,2013-01-26T17:03:48Z,"Let's take this even one step further. If the user has already selected an address, why would she want to type another one? So I'd suggest disabling the address field (meaning it is only used for display, editing is disabled) and remove the addressbook button in that case.\n\nNo interactive layout changes necessary any more...\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2219#issuecomment-12738132,12738132,

schildbach,2013-01-26T18:23:34Z,"In this case, go back and select the right one. Also, do you think a lot of people will even notice their mistake? They would need compare the hash value against a memorized value.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2219#issuecomment-12739550,12739550,
Diapolo,2013-01-27T10:29:21Z,"This discussion seems rather controversial, so @laanwj would you ACK this, if I just disable the button on valid address entered? I'm fine with such a solution.\n\nEdit: Changed to enable/disable instead of show/hide.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2219#issuecomment-12752371,12752371,

luke-jr,2013-01-30T18:16:15Z,"I disagree with this change. I often sign a message, then want to change to another address later. It'd be annoying to have to edit the address to make it invalid just to change it...\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2219#issuecomment-12903876,12903876,

laanwj,2013-07-26T05:54:50Z,"I'm not really convinced this is an useful or expected behavior, to be honest. \nIt arbitrary prevents the user from doing things (ie, select another address) without being clear what can be done to do override that. He'd have to jump through a hoop by deleting a character from the address. Usually I don't  like when GUIs do that.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2219#issuecomment-21602818,21602818,
