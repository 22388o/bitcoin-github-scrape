domob1812,2018-08-22T06:19:21Z,It seems the build fails on Windows in CI due to missing the ZMQ C++ language bindings.  I don't know anything about either the CI system or Windows; so not sure if this just means we have to reconfigure it somehow or if that indicates that we need another dependency that is potentially unwanted.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14017#issuecomment-414924242,414924242,
