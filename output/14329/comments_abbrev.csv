sipa,2018-09-27T11:55:45Z,"I believe this won't have any effect. Modern compilers recognize the pattern used in the current code as byteswapping, and will use an appropriate native operation for it if available. I think it's likely the binary output is in fact identical before and after.\n\nThat said, it's probably more clear and reliable to use the builtin when available.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14329#issuecomment-425062459,425062459,
jgarzik,2018-09-27T12:08:48Z,"Agree with @sipa 's first paragraph.\n\nTypically the modern compilers _plus system headers_ do a better job, and are better maintained By The People Who Know These Things (gcc/llvm/glibc people).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14329#issuecomment-425066455,425066455,
DesWurstes,2018-09-27T13:41:42Z,"I've experimented: GCC can see that pattern since 4.5 and Clang can see it since 3.0. MSVC still can't recognize `bswap64`.\n\nSo, closing it.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14329#issuecomment-425096968,425096968,
