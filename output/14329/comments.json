    "body": "I believe this won't have any effect. Modern compilers recognize the pattern used in the current code as byteswapping, and will use an appropriate native operation for it if available. I think it's likely the binary output is in fact identical before and after.\n\nThat said, it's probably more clear and reliable to use the builtin when available.",
