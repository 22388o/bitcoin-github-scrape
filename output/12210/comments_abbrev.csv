meshcollider,2018-01-17T12:26:20Z,Yeah `getnewaddress` with the `address_type` parameter more closely resembles what this RPC was used for IMO,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12210#discussion_r162035604,162035604,src/wallet/rpcwallet.cpp

meshcollider,2018-01-17T12:47:59Z,"Also, if you deprecate it like this you'll have to add -deprecatedrpc=addwitnessaddress to the tests which use it (easier than reworking the tests at the same time)",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12210#discussion_r162040601,162040601,src/wallet/rpcwallet.cpp

flack,2018-01-17T14:57:30Z,should say `-deprecatedrpc=addwitnessaddress` instead of `-deprecatedrpc=estimatefee`,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12210#discussion_r162074199,162074199,src/wallet/rpcwallet.cpp
