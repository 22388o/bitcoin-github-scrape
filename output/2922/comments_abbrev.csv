Diapolo,2013-08-21T13:39:56Z,Can someone take a look at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/translation_process.md#fetching-new-translations and make this compatible with my MinGW shell :-)?

Diapolo,2013-08-22T05:14:07Z,I have no idea what you are talking about? Perhaps 0.8.4 was not based on current master.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2922#issuecomment-23068905,23068905,
gavinandresen,2013-08-22T05:22:47Z,"0.8.4 is 0.8.3 plus a few bug fixes.  It has nothing to do with current master, and contains no new translatable strings.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2922#issuecomment-23069125,23069125,
wtogami,2013-08-22T05:27:44Z,"0.8.2 on May 25th was the last release tagged from master branch.  0.8.3 and 0.8.4 diverged from master after that point, and master is quite different now.  It may be possible for you to generate updated translations for 0.8.4 branch specifically, although I am not sure how accurate it would be if Transifex was working from master all this time.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2922#issuecomment-23069246,23069246,

Diapolo,2013-08-22T05:48:33Z,"@gavinandresen It would still be a good thing, to get current translations into releases, which are not based on current master, but I can't think of a clean way to do this. As 0.8.4 may contain old strings that are not recent in current master anymore and as such are removed on Transifex and would then be untranslated...\n\n@wtogami Right, there is no good way to achieve this.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2922#issuecomment-23069807,23069807,
