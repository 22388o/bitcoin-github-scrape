Aristarkhov,2021-04-03 01:20:15,"> I'm wondering why the compiler doesn't warn about trying to evaluate the result of a void-function-call in a non-trivial expression. I can't think of a situation where this would make any sense.\n\nI guess this happens because compilers support `return void;` in void function call, and `addUnchecked` returns `void`.\nIn any other case there would have been a warning :)",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21577#issuecomment-812772081,812772081,
