maaku,2015-09-23T17:40:24Z,"Yep that would have been better. However I wonder if this is necessary or desirable now that this PR has received many full reviews, including verification that the change is a soft-fork.\n\nIf you or others are having trouble verifying this, I recommend looking at the individual commits.

sipa,2015-10-13T17:45:08Z,"(summarizing earlier discussion about this) The problem is that that would be the case whenever the wallet check finality on an transaction whose inputs are already spent.\n\nIMHO the clean solution is to pass in the heights/times of all inputs to this function, which could have a different implementation for mempool/wallet/blockchain behaviour.
