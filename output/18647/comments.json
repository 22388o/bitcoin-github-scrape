Why should JSONRPCRequest know anything about NodeContext? I see no reason to let a passive object (a request) that's going back and forth knowing anything about its environment. But maybe there are other things I know nothing about that would mandate such behavior.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, there are still a few places where we still need *g_rpc_node*, but those aren't directly related to this PR, so I deliberately didn't change them. \r\n\r\n**--EDIT**: *My sentence \"never wanted to get rid of it\" might have been misleading. Actually, I want to get rid of it as a global, but wanted to keep the NodeContext itself available to all RPC methods by forwarding it to Actors, of course.*\r\n\r\n**--EDIT 2**: Now the **g_rpc_node** is completely gone.\r\n\r\n> * `NodeContext& rpc_node` arguments should be renamed `NodeContext& node`, RPC prefix is misleading and not doing anything\r\n\r\nOk.\r\n\r\n**--EDIT**: Was changed and force-pushed.\r\n\r\n> * `NodeContext* pnode_ctx` followed by `CHECK_NONFATAL(pnode_ctx)` should probably be `NodeContext& node` and not using a pointer. Also current coding convention doesn't prefix pointers variable with p.\r\n\r\nOk. Will check it again.\r\n\r\n**--EDIT**: *Have checked it. Sadly, not possible because copy assignment operator of NodeContext is implicitly deleted. So, will keep it a pointer there, and the check, unless someone comes with a better idea. Any inputs that help me get rid of raw pointers are highly welcome :)*\r\n\r\n> * Wallet RPC methods shouldn't have access to NodeContext. \r\n\r\nI didn't know about his. I thought it's the right place to put the context in, because those methods are being executed *within* a NodeContext. It's like \"self\" variable in python, for example. It's simply there, be it used or not, because at no point in time is an RPC method being used outside NodeContext. But I might be mistaken.\r\n\r\n> At some point we should have WalletContext struct that will hold things like vpwallets and let us get rid of wallet globals, and it would make sense for wallet RPC methods to have access to this. That is why suggestion from #17548 was to just add a new member to JSONRPCRequest that could hold a generic context, not something tied to the wallet or node. Other advantage of using JSONRPCRequest is that you dont' have to change RPC method signatures.\r\n\r\nAgain, why should a passive object, like a request, know anything about the environment that's using it? Why not create some kind of *MetaContext* that holds both Node- and WalletContext and forwards it directly to actors? This way one could easily extend contexts, if there might be a need to do so in future (*I'm only speculating here*)\r\n\r\n**--EDIT**: Another option would be to create a MetaContext that's based on aliasing shared_ptr. Something like this: \r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nstruct MetaContext {\r\n    NodeContext node;\r\n    WalletContext wallet;\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe then initialize the meta-context first:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nauto meta_ctx = std::shared_ptr<MetaContext>(new MetaContext());\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, when we want to forward the \"correct\" context to a particular actor, we would do this:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nauto subctx_node = std::shared_ptr<NodeContext>(meta_ctx, &meta_ctx->node);  \r\n```\r\n\r\nFor functions that should only deal with Wallet, we then go this way:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nauto subctx_wallet = std::shared_ptr<WalletContext>(meta_ctx, &meta_ctx->wallet);  \r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this strategy we could put any number of different contexts in the same place, but only reveal those that are of use to functions which will consume them.\r\n\r\n> * This appears to be adding `NodeContext&` parameters to many RPC methods that don't use it. Again this may be another reason to just make it accessible through JSONRPCRequest\r\n\r\nI see it like the \"self\" or \"this\" pointers. They're always there, regardless of usage. \"Some\" context is always there.\r\n\r\nAnyway, thanks again!\r\n",

These changes will make multiprocess and offline wallet work more difficult, and get in the way of any features that want to accept RPC requests outside of the node process.\r\n\r\nThe NodeContext structure is actually even bigger. It contains various things, so you are right. But also: _maybe NodeContext itself should be split into smaller parts_? To me, it looks like NodeContext carries many heavy things. I actually never needed NodeContext as a whole but merely a pointer/ref to one of its members. However, this is not important here, imo, so I'll leave it for another discussion.\r\n\r\n> * Adding NodeContext parameter to every single RPC method when most of these methods don't need it and some of them (wallet methods) should not have access to it. \r\n\r\nYes, it's not the cutest thing to do, but a bit less ugly than a global pointer. And as I said, I never needed NodeContext itself, only a pointer/ref from it.\r\n\r\n> This makes the change bigger and harder to review, \r\n\r\nTo understand why *g_rpc_node* is everywhere and how to deal with it correctly, was hard to me. :)\r\n\r\nLater then, *g_rpc_chain* came to the party. \r\n\r\n> and will potentially cause confusion and\r\n> accidental changes that will again make multiprocess and offline wallet work more difficult.\r\n\r\nAs I still lack enough knowledge about these areas, I can only agree with you.\r\n\r\n> * Making unit test initialization inconsistent with application initialization.

Removing null checks in rest and rpc code and segfaulting when the context isn't available instead of returning HTTP errors\r\n\r\nI was actually checking for *nullptr* at the very beginning of the initialization. But, this is not important here, so the code as it is, is not stable enough. Accepted.\r\n\r\n> * Making spurious changes that complicate review, adding consts, removing consts, changing indentation, making manual changes that would be safer as scripted-diffs\r\n\r\nI use *clang format* as stated in Bitcoin docs. \r\n\r\n```shell\r\ngit diff -U0 HEAD~1.. | ./contrib/devtools/clang-format-diff.py -p1 -i -v\r\n```\r\n\r\nRegarding **const/non-costs**: it was because the NodeContext has an implicitly deleted copy assignment constructor, because one of its members is a **unique_ptr**. So, I had to find a way around this impasse. This too is one of the things that make me believe, that NodeContext itself should be split into smaller parts. But, this is not that important here, I think.\r\n\r\n> * Not using recommended style, using pointers instead of references, using hungarian notation, using #include where a forward declaration would be more efficient\r\n\r\nI would like to know more about the *bitcoinic* coding style. If you have any doc/link please, let me know. I could not find anything. \r\n\r\n> * Making `NodeContext` a more ubiquitous presence in the codebase than it was ever meant to be (increasing from 66 to 266 usages).\r\n\r\nNodeContext should maybe be made even smaller, imo. So, yes, I agree with you.\r\n\r\n> \r\n> It was good to see this PR opened and have progress on #17548, and be useful as an experiment, \r\n\r\nYes, that was the initial motivation. The original issue https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/17548 was hanging around for some time, so I thought, let's do something about it.\r\n\r\n> but I think this is not the best way forward and would recommend not doing more work on this PR\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, it was the best way to forward *for me*, as it helped me a lot to understand some interesting parts of Bitcoin. And I thank you for that! However, you are right, it's not the best way to forward *for the project*, so I will close my PR, and will study your code and try it out. \r\n\r\nThanks again!",
