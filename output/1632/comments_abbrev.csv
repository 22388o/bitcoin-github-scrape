Diapolo,2012-07-26T08:07:57Z,Of course ACK to such a thing.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1632#issuecomment-7271703,7271703,
laanwj,2012-07-28T08:43:26Z,"Oops, seems this needs rebase now, it conflicts with #1571.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1632#issuecomment-7331525,7331525,
jgarzik,2012-08-01T16:48:07Z,"sigh, weak ACK, needs rebase.\n\na few quibbles, nothing NAK worthy:\n- I prefer ""nId's"" construction, as it separates the variable's precise spelling.  addrinfo's etc.\n- ""ciphertext"" is valid and common\n- ditto ""filename""\n- ""cleanup"" and ""whitespace"" are common even if invalid\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1632#issuecomment-7432712,7432712,
luke-jr,2012-08-01T17:53:13Z,"Rebased and fixed @jgarzik 's spelling qubbles. However, I left nIds and addrinfos, because:\n- ""nId's"" construction is invalid grammar\n- nIds is in fact used as a variable name already\n- addrinfo is not a variable name at all (CAddrInfo is a class)\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1632#issuecomment-7434590,7434590,
Diapolo,2012-07-26T08:11:46Z,"I don't understand this change, why logfile first and in the end log file ... I thought log file is the correct spelling?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1632#discussion_r1242115,1242115,src/qt/forms/rpcconsole.ui
