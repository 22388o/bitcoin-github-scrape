practicalswift,2019-01-14T16:38:54Z,@promag The `shellcheck` on Travis is pre-installed AFAIK - we don't install it explicitly in our Travis conf. Also since we don't control the version the user has installed pinning wouldn't have prevented the version problem described in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14115/commits/908a559f33cf9d774953ce46e159e66fc9bc758d.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15166#issuecomment-454071796,454071796,
promag,2019-01-14T16:43:10Z,"@practicalswift IMO what the user has it not a problem, instead it helps if the user has a newer version so he can update the travis one if necessary.\n\nWe could run in a docker container?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15166#issuecomment-454073352,454073352,

MarcoFalke,2019-01-14T22:27:39Z,So we'd still had to support multiple versions of shellcheck,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15166#issuecomment-454185637,454185637,
promag,2019-01-14T22:31:36Z,@MarcoFalke why? The official supported would be the travis IMO. If the linter fails for the user then he either upgrades/downgrades his version or submit a pull to fix the (most likely) new version.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15166#issuecomment-454186712,454186712,
