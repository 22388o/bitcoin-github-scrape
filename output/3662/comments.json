    "body": "NACK\n\nIt's becoming clear that the Bitcoin world is actually long overdue for resuming some serious \"navel gazing\".\n\n[Again](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3661#issuecomment-34925430) (updated for this proposal):\n\n> What the Bitcoin world has come to understand recently is that even a transaction created by a **trusted party**\u2014namely by yourself\u2014is not necessarily ever going to get into the blockchain; thus, it's fairly risky to base _any_ calculation on _any_ transaction that is not already buried in the blockchain.\n> \n> **More to the point of this commit, though**: Your \"trusted\" balance is meaningless unless you _can_ spend that value, and yet that value _cannot_ be spent unless the Bitcoin network\u2014yes, the _third-party payment processor_\u2014says you can spend it; your personal, individual client really has very little say in the matter, a point that is compounded by mutable (malleable) transactions.\n> \n> So, I think your `CWalletTx::IsTrusted()` is a lie, and it certainly doesn't take care of the fact that the _confirmed_ balance will _still_ be including _unconfirmed_ change. These issues need to be handled altogether differently.\n\n[and](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3661#issuecomment-34940046):\n\n> > **sipa:** That's a confusion that afaik as existed forever in the source code: IsConfirmed should be called IsTrusted or something instead (it means confirmed OR from ourselves).\n> \n> But the larger point is that a transaction from oneself cannot actually be trusted; due to transaction mutability, any source other than the blockchain itself is irrelevant (for various degrees of risk aversion). So, this is not just a question of naming; it's a question of real risk.\n> \n> When you think about it, you cannot be terribly miffed about this larger point, because that's all Bitcoin ever proffered, anyway: \"Data buried in the blockchain is what can be trusted.\" It's better to work with that reality rather than against it.\n",
