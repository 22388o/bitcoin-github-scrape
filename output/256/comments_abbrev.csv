TheBlueMatt,2011-06-14T16:21:32Z,"IMHO this belongs in Bitcointools or other similar software, not in Bitcoin (feature creep and its more wallet recovery which IMHO should be encouraged not using Bitcoin, but using external tools as there is too much chance to make it worse), but maybe others disagree?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/256#issuecomment-1367165,1367165,
