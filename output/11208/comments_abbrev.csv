laanwj,2017-09-05T15:56:44Z,"> I believe this was fixed here : #10156\n\nI was about to remark this - there have been a few PRs before in the last few years 'fixing' this issue, but it keeps returning (or wasn't fixed properly after all). So normally we would make sure of this by unit tests but I don't think that's an option here due to the GUI-ness. So I suggest creating a manual testplan before/after, so we can verify tha",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11208#issuecomment-327221028,327221028,
