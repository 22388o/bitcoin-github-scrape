gmaxwell,2014-10-08T08:17:15Z,utACK.  We should probalby also have some rpc that triggers alertnotify locally so people can test their setup.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5059#issuecomment-58324789,58324789,

Diapolo,2014-10-08T11:25:32Z,I also think the new switch should be listed in the `Debugging/Testing options` section in our help message.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5059#issuecomment-58343702,58343702,
gavinandresen,2014-10-09T14:32:45Z,"Nits picked (except for whitespace and add-to-command-line-options nits, which I disagree with).\n\nWill merge.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5059#issuecomment-58518113,58518113,
Diapolo,2014-10-09T19:11:59Z,"@gavinandresen I didn't introduce the `Debugging/Testing options` section, but still think `-blockversion` belongs right there! It's inconsistent to not add it IMHO. You may hate my other nits also, but as I said, if @sipa let the clang cleanup run over these files, it will exactyl eat what you left in here...\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5059#issuecomment-58561759,58561759,
sipa,2014-10-09T19:14:14Z,@Diapolo that's exactly the point. Using clang-format allows to clean up coding style afterwards is much easier to review (by just running clang-format yourself) than indentation changes mixed with semantic changes.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5059#issuecomment-58562110,58562110,
Diapolo,2014-10-10T07:43:59Z,@sipa Then let's decide when we finally do THAT :)!? Still the point of mentioning the parameter in help... I don't get it.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5059#issuecomment-58622611,58622611,
sipa,2014-10-10T09:15:52Z,@Diapolo right before release candidates. Otherwise it will totally disrupt every pull request in existence.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5059#issuecomment-58631510,58631510,

Diapolo,2014-10-08T11:13:22Z,Nit: No newline after `void`? The clang format will eat this.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5059#discussion_r18575501,18575501,src/alert.cpp
Diapolo,2014-10-08T11:14:27Z,"Nit: Use a space after and before the `+`, also a clang format thing.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5059#discussion_r18575539,18575539,src/alert.cpp

theuni,2014-10-08T23:20:46Z,Note: These tests aren't currently being run on Travis. I'll PR a fix to hook em back up and document what's changed.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5059#discussion_r18619302,18619302,qa/pull-tester/build-tests.sh.in
