luke-jr,2012-10-12T22:07:10Z,"Actually, I don't think it's this simple. With the new height-in-coinbase requirement, I expect either this can be left alone/null, or we need to put a height in there. I would have expected the latter, but it's obviously working right now for some (unknown to me) reason...\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1926#issuecomment-9394306,9394306,

Right now the dummy script is four bytes on 32 bit systems and eight bytes on 64 bit systems, and may contain undefined data (possible information leak or crash), which is obviously wrong.\n\nIf two bytes is not the right size, what is? (If eight bytes is working, safest may be to  just fix it to eight zero bytes)\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1926#issuecomment-9394729,9394729,
