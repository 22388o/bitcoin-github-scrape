theuni,2014-10-01T23:42:58Z,Paging @gavinandresen. This should fix your build.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5026#issuecomment-57559046,57559046,
gavinandresen,2014-10-02T16:02:49Z,"ACK, I can build both qt4 and qt5, and a code-signed macdeployqtplus works with the qt5 build.\n\nJust FYI: macdeployqtplus doesn't work with the qt4 build; codesign is upset that there is a Resources/ folder at the top-level of Bitcoin-Qt.app/Contents/Frameworks/QtGui.framework  \n\n```\ndist/Bitcoin-Qt.app: unsealed contents present in the root directory of an embedded framework\n```\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5026#issuecomment-57652985,57652985,
laanwj,2014-10-02T17:37:11Z,"@theuni This does not apply as-is to 0.9.3 branch (too many changes to build system since). If this intended for the next 0.9.x as well, can you do a pull against that?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5026#issuecomment-57668018,57668018,
theuni,2014-10-02T18:51:45Z,"@gavinandresen Thanks for verifying. I'll see if there's a quick/easy fix for qt4 (and if any qt5 build scenarios could end up with the same issue). I don't think it's worth too much effort though, since realistically we won't be signing any more qt4 binaries.\n\n@laanwj Will do.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5026#issuecomment-57683496,57683496,
