    "body": "Right, the issue is that if an exception is thrown across a dso boundary, the receiver's symbol must be exported in order to catch it. In practice, due to the boost bug, that'd mean that we have to export all functions that may need to catch a boost exception. Imo that's not reasonable, especially since it's due to a faulty lib.\n\nThis wouldn't affect any of our final releases, though, as they're all built with a static boost.\n\nI would very much like to see this enabled by default as well, but it would mean refusing to build against boost < 1.49. I'd be much more comfortable with enforcing that restriction at some point in the future than trying to work around it by manually exporting many unrelated functions now.\n\nThe third option would be detecting the boost version and selectively enabling reduced exports, but I'm not sure I'd be comfortable with that either.\n",

Then see whether you get `export of symbol %s not allowed` errors.\n\n(To be clear, I'm fine with merging this as well, even if it doesn't fix the problem mentioned in the gitian descriptor, its still a good change!)\n",

    "body": "@laanwj Ok, I gave it a go on gitian, and got (presumably) the same results as you. I dug around for a bit and it looks like precise\u2019s default linker (bfd) has busted support for \u201c\u2014exclude-libs ALL\u201d. Most distros these days have switched to gold anyway. I installed that and it worked as it should\u2019ve.\n\nSo basically, all is good if you add \u201cbinutils-gold\u201d to the packages list in the descriptor. I\u2019ll add that into my PR on monday after verifying that it's still deterministic.\n\nScript output from gitian looks like this:\n\n```\n/home/ubuntu/out/bin/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/test_bitcoin-qt: export of symbol _edata not allowed\n/home/ubuntu/out/bin/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/test_bitcoin-qt: export of symbol _end not allowed\n/home/ubuntu/out/bin/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/test_bitcoin-qt: export of symbol _init not allowed\n/home/ubuntu/out/bin/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/test_bitcoin-qt: export of symbol __bss_start not allowed\n/home/ubuntu/out/bin/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/test_bitcoin-qt: export of symbol _fini not allowed\n/home/ubuntu/out/bin/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/bitcoin-cli: export of symbol std::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> > std::operator+<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> >(char const*, std::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> > const&) not allowed\n/home/ubuntu/out/bin/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/bitcoin-cli: export of symbol std::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> > std::operator+<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> >(std::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> > const&, std::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> > const&) not allowed\n/home/ubuntu/out/bin/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/bitcoin-qt: export of symbol _edata not allowed\n/home/ubuntu/out/bin/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/bitcoin-qt: export of symbol _end not allowed\n/home/ubuntu/out/bin/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/bitcoin-qt: export of symbol _init not allowed\n/home/ubuntu/out/bin/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/bitcoin-qt: export of symbol __bss_start not allowed\n/home/ubuntu/out/bin/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/bitcoin-qt: export of symbol _fini not allowed\n```\n\nLooks like there\u2019s a single bug in that version\u2019s libstdc++ that causes the strings to be visible, but that\u2019s nothing to worry about (and it's obviously been fixed since, since it doesn't show up for me locally).\n\nSo as far as I\u2019m concerned, the visibility changes here are enough to get us what we\u2019re after, assuming the deps/tools aren\u2019t busted. Using the gold linker for precise seems to be all it takes to work around.\n",
