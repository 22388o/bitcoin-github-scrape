The reason for backporting was *not* that it was a requirement for taproot. It was discussed as being an independently useful change. wtxid relay has been wanted since segwit was introduced (#8279), the feature was developed against 0.20, and missed feature freeze by a few weeks, so was a trivial backport.\r\n\r\n> people weren't aware that this change relay introduced a crash vulnerability (which was accidentally fixed by a separate re-factoring change)\r\n\r\nThe crash vulnerability that you're refering to wasn't introduced in #18044. It came in commit [`9efd86a` (#19569)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19569/commits/9efd86a908cf09d9ddbadd3195f202635117d505) in the follow-up PR. It wasn't 'accidentally fixed by a separate refactoring change' - I explicitly pointed out the problem in review here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19569#discussion_r462887483, and wrote a fix here: [`fb56d37` (#19610)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19610/commits/fb56d37612dea6666e7da73d671311a697570dae), which was included in the follow-up PR. I've also included that commit in this backport.\r\n\r\nI still think it's useful to have wtxid relay widely deployed (and also have the ability to request orphan parents from wtxid peers). If other people disagree, then we can close this PR.",

Am I confused?\r\n\r\nThat matches my understanding -- the risk was that if taproot was deployed, then nodes running 0.20 and earlier would see soft-rejects txs spending taproot UTXOs, but only due to the witness being non-standard, so would re-request the tx from each other peer that advertised the tx, wasting bandwidth. But #19681 and #19680 fixed this in 0.19 and 0.20 already.\r\n\r\nBut that's an argument for why #19606 wasn't necessary; this PR fixes a regression in orphan handling introduced by that change.",
