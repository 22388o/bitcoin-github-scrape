ryanofsky,2020-04-16 15:27:30,"> I suggest using the following equivalent formulation which removes the need for the clarifying comment\n\nReadability is subjective, but to me that suggestion is less readable, more verbose, and less clear that the evaluations are intentional not accidental. Comments are useful when they convey intent.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18660#issuecomment-614723368,614723368,
MarcoFalke,2020-04-16 15:45:26,"This is adding documentation and tests. Should be good to merge with two ACKs. If the AutoSAR static analyser can't read the comment that the `&` are desired, it should probably be fixed upstream.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18660#issuecomment-614733599,614733599,
