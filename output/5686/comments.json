There we could also support the `--with-incompatible-bdb` option so users could make sure to use the same version as they used while creating/manipulating their wallets.\n",

Newer BDB versions have no problem reading old databases. The problem is the other way around. After the file is \"touched\" it won't be backwards compatible anymore. Making a temporary copy then reading that would be a strategy to keep the origin file as-is.\n",

    "body": "Supporting both (bdb and logdb) wallet formats (at runtime) would require some work.\nI'm also aware of the missing backward compatibility. Supporting bdb wallets after a possible switch to logdb would require resources better spent at bip32, accounting overhaul, etc.\nIMO a clean cut would be worth it. Remove all the migration, min-version feature-compatibility legacy stuff.\n\nI agree with not letting users in the dark and support a migration tool (c++, included in bitcoind for 0.11 or 0.12, but slowly extract migration tool to different repository).\nFirst \"logdb\" release could still include bdb as dependency, used for compiling the bitcoin migration tool. If you miss the library, it will build bitcoin-core without this tool (like #5680).\n\nMigration of a wallet is a risky process and it's probably better to do this outside of bitcoind as a conscious decision from the user.   \n",

    "body": "On IRC I've explicitly argued against dual database support, and I'm going to do so here again.\nHaving an intermediate phase where both databases are supported means legacy concerns (such as accounts) have to ooze into the new wallet interface. It also complicates testing. Are you going to verify that the new wallet will keep working with 0.3 wallets at every step of development?\n\nAn alternative option I've thought of is to leave the old wallet untouched. Move `wallet,walletdb,rpcwallet` (and others as needed) to `src/legacywallet`. \n\nThen build this new wallet with new database, new interface in `src/wallet/`. As well as a migration tool.\n\nUsing a configure option, one can then either build against the new wallet or the old wallet.\nThis gives the 'conservative' choice to stick with the old wallet (for however long we're willing to carry it) with all its quirks, but without intermediate complications for the new code, and having to carry any of that over.\n\nIn the beginning the legacywallet will be the default and the new wallet will be experimental-only.\n\nThis is basically the \"fork the wallet and develop it separately\" approach, but a bit improvised as it's all in one repository - for now. It means we can merge this soon(TM) and experiment with it, instead of delaying that to a further future 'when it's ready'. \n\n(the only complication here I see is with regard to the UI, which has to interface with both, but a similar thing can be done there; UI that only applies to the old wallet can be moved to a legacy directory)\n",

Even rpcwallet.cpp could support both. But this needs work.\n\nThe 2nd concern is more a \"conceptual\" one. If we support both wallet formats, why should one upgrade his wallet? Couldn't that not lead to a need of supporting both formats? And if we once drop support of BDB, how is the migration process different now from the one in future (the user has to do it once anyway)? Maybe we could force people to upgrade and save some - already rare - development resources. I mean it's not the network, it's the wallet.\n",

This is long due anyhow, and mostly low-impact move-only.\n- My idea is not about supporting two formats, but supporting two different wallets. The old wallet will stay exactly as it is now (barring critical fixes). The new wallet will see new development, and come with new features (as well as get rid of old cruft), and an interface that supports e.g. multiwallet. It just means that the transition process is more smooth.\n\nMore daring users can use the new wallet, whereas more conservative  users can stay with the old wallet for say a major release or two until it is completely axed (but the new one, as well as the conversion process, much better tested).\n\n@luke-jr Building a monster executable with _both_ wallet implementations could be possible, with e.g. an command line option to switch. Not sure if this is a good idea in practice, but I don't want to exclude the possibility upfront. We'll see when we get there I suppose. _In the beginning_ this won't be an issue as the new wallet will be experimental-only so requiring build-time invocations is a good thing.\n",

    "body": "I like the roadmap with multiwallet support and a legacy wallet / new wallet selectable. Maybe add a migrate button that only appears when the legacy wallet is selected.\nMaybe we want to support this wallet selection (and the migration button) as a build option disabled by default until it gets more testing as @laanwj also suggests.\nThen enable it by default or just remove the option and enable it always and eventually, some day, drop support for the legacy wallet entirely. The \"alternate repo for the migration tool\" would just be the version previous to dropping the support.\nIt could be as short as:\n- 0.11 multiwallet with migration tool\n- 0.12 drop support for legacy wallet.\n",

But I'm not sure how other people will feel about that type of backards support.\n\nI believe separating a CWallet interface from a CLegacyWallet implementation would already be a gain and a good first step for all cases. I'm not sure if you're arguing against that, against multi-wallet support, or only against supporting several types of wallets at the same time.\n",

Unless somebody else convince me for another way i think i start with this (maybe this is more or less the original idea of @laanwj):\n- Replace the wallet code inside of the `#ifdef WALLET_ENABLE` with flexible hooks. Goal: get rid of wallet-code inside of the bitcoind's general code. We can keep the ifdefs or we could provide a empty \"no-wallet\" instance to allow the user to run without a wallet.\n- Move everything wallet related to `src/wallet/` (rpc dispatch table, unit-test, etc.)\n- Create a clean, more or less abstract, wallet interface outside or `src/wallet` where wallets can inherit from \n- Add support for the legacy bdb wallet (update to the new interface)\n- Add support for the already more or less done logdb wallet\n- Add a feature flags to wallet-interface so bitcoin-qt can check if a wallet support a such feature like multiwallet, backup-capabilities, bip32, etc.\n\nThis would be more effort then i originally thought, but will finally cut out the wallet-code and place it behind a clean interface.\n\nAny concerns when going into this direction?\n",

    "body": "@jonasschnelli : Sounds good to me. Some notes:\n\n> `provide a empty \"no-wallet\" instance to allow the user to run without a wallet.`. \n\nDon't call it a no-wallet. As with the NotificationInterface, just give it a general name, like ModuleInterface. In this case it's used to plug in a wallet, but the same mechanism could be used to plug in another module that provides e.g. RPC calls and hooks into the init/shutdown.\n\nThis is not just a hack to support two wallets, but a step toward more modularity. Not sure if you ever saw #3440, but it was a plan in the same direction.\n\n> if we support both wallets, things like multiwallet or bip32 needs implementation in both worlds. Even if only one wallet type can handle things like multiwallet support, the interface needs adaption for supporting this somehow.\n\nMy point was to _avoid_ a common interface by completely separating the implementations. E.g. move the old wallet and RPC code that uses it out of the way.\n\nIf this turns out to not be possible/practical, of course you could decide to not do this.\n\nI'm just afraid this will mean it will take a long time until the new wallet can be merged. It means it needs to be suitable for _all_ users of the current wallet, instead of initially just experimental users. It also means it will get a lot less testing until it is merged. This has shown to be a problem for pulls that make large changes to the wallet before (like the last round of multi-wallet changes), eventually resulting in the owner giving up and them never being merged. That's why I proposed this, not to give you extra work.\n\n> But yes. The legacy-bdb-wallet needs a lot of moving/changes to fit in a new flexible wallet implementation.\n\nOK, my idea was that this would not be needed. Every change potentially introduces bugs. If you need many changes to the legacy wallet, this defeats the purpose of having a stable, unchanged legacy wallet.\n",
