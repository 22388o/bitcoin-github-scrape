Perhaps it was a mistake in retrospect, and we should have done something like BIP155 back then immediately, but that was not something I was considering.",

If you're that concerned about privacy you should just disable listening entirely, and not create hidden services - not even ephemeral ones.\r\n\r\nCreating new ones on restart makes the privacy/usefulness tradeoff dependent on how frequently your node restarts. If you restart all the time, it's equivalent to not having a hidden service at all. If you never restart, it's equivalent to having a persistent onion address. If this is an interesting tradeoff at all, it should be an option to configure how frequently to create a new one - but I don't think that anything less than days or weeks even is useful.",

    "body": "There seems to be agreement that there doesn't need to be specific functionality for \"ephermal onions\". If you do not want your node to be reachable on an onion address it's best to disable `-listenonion`. There's no point in having time-limited onion addresses in bitcoin, the time it takes to gossip an address and for other peers to really connect is long enough that it's undesirable to repeat that process every time. So better to just disable it than bother with extra complexity to say, rotate private service keys.\r\n\r\nAnd if you really, really want this functionality it can already be achieved from outside by say, a crontab, deleting the onion private key periodically and restarting `bitcoind`. Or even by managing Tor's configuration yourself.\r\n\r\nIn any case I'm [repeating myself here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19635#issuecomment-667677093), closing this PR.",
