MarcoFalke,2016-05-26T15:44:11Z,"@sdaftuar Can you explain how this helps tab-completion? I fail to see the difference in the '.' vs '/'.\n\nAlso, this would mean to adjust the `--tmpdir` help to `help=""Path prefix for datadirs. (portseed is appended to the prefix)""`.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8098#issuecomment-221910162,221910162,
sdaftuar,2016-05-26T16:35:12Z,"@MarcoFalke  Ah I hadn't thought about the --tmpdir argument requiring us to use space inside that directory tree, that's a fair point.  I was just thinking that I have to press [tab] one extra time to tab-complete to a subdirectory, maybe that's unique to my shell/environment, but not a big deal.\n\nACK\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8098#issuecomment-221925018,221925018,
