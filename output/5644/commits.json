Upgrading to this release is recommended.\n+\n+Please report bugs using the issue tracker at github:\n+\n+  https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues\n+\n+How to Upgrade\n+===============\n+\n+If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely\n+shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the\n+installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on Mac) or\n+bitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux).\n+\n+OpenSSL Warning\n+================\n+\n+OpenSSL 1.0.0p / 1.0.1k was recently released and is being pushed out by\n+various operating system maintainers. Review by Gregory Maxwell determined that\n+this update is incompatible with the Bitcoin system and could lead to consensus\n+forks.\n+\n+Bitcoin Core released binaries from https://bitcoin.org are unaffected,\n+as are any built with the gitian deterministic build system.\n+\n+However, if you are running either\n+\n+- The Ubuntu PPA from https://launchpad.net/~bitcoin/+archive/ubuntu/bitcoin\n+- A third-party or self-compiled Bitcoin Core\n+\n+upgrade to Bitcoin Core 0.9.4, which includes a workaround, **before** updating\n+OpenSSL.\n+\n+The incompatibility is due to the OpenSSL update changing the\n+behavior of ECDSA validation to reject any signature which is\n+not encoded in a very rigid manner. This was a result of\n+OpenSSL's change for CVE-2014-8275 \"Certificate fingerprints\n+can be modified\".\n+\n+We are specifically aware of potential hard-forks due to signature\n+encoding handling and had been hoping to close them via BIP62 in 0.10.\n+BIP62's purpose is to improve transaction malleability handling and\n+as a side effect rigidly defines the encoding for signatures, but the\n+overall scope of BIP62 has made it take longer than we'd like to\n+deploy.\n+\n+0.9.4 changelog\n+================\n+\n+Validation:\n+- `b8e81b7` consensus: guard against openssl's new strict DER checks\n+- `60c51f1` fail immediately on an empty signature\n+- `037bfef` Improve robustness of DER recoding code\n+\n+Command-line options:\n+- `cd5164a` Make -proxy set all network types, avoiding a connect leak.\n+\n+P2P:\n+- `bb424e4` Limit the number of new addressses to accumulate\n+\n+RPC:\n+- `0a94661` Disable SSLv3 (in favor of TLS) for the RPC client and server.\n+\n+Build system:\n+- `f047dfa` gitian: openssl-1.0.1i.tar.gz -> openssl-1.0.1k.tar.gz\n+- `5b9f78d` build: Fix OSX build when using Homebrew and qt5\n+- `ffab1dd` Keep symlinks when copying into .app bundle\n+- `613247f` osx: fix signing to make Gatekeeper happy (again)\n+\n+Miscellaneous:\n+- `25b49b5` Refactor -alertnotify code\n+- `2743529` doc: Add instructions for consistent Mac OS X build names\n+\n+Credits\n+--------\n+\n+Thanks to who contributed to this release, at least:\n+\n+- Cory Fields\n+- Gavin Andresen\n+- Gregory Maxwell\n+- Jeff Garzik\n+- Luke Dashjr\n+- Matt Corallo\n+- Pieter Wuille\n+- Saivann\n+- Sergio Demian Lerner\n+- Wladimir J. van der Laan\n+\n+As well as everyone that helped translating on [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/bitcoin/)."
