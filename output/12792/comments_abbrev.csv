skeees,2018-05-04T16:00:44Z,@jnewbery @promag - with the ongoing efforts to do dynamic wallet (un)loading and to move wallet maintenance into a wallet-tool - is this still relevant/necessary? if not will close,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12792#issuecomment-386646772,386646772,
promag,2018-05-04T21:33:36Z,"Not sure @skeees, this is orthogonal to dynamic wallet (un)loading.\n\nBTW, how about a different approach: load the wallet in ""read only"" mode?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12792#issuecomment-386740995,386740995,

laanwj,2018-03-26T19:23:06Z,"For consistency, we try to make the meaning positive for new options, instead of reversing w/ disable in front.\nE.g. make this option `-walletupdates` and default to `1`, so that the usual `-nowalletupdates` or `-walletupdates=0` can be used to not do wallet updates.\n\nAlso: is this uncommon enough to make it an untranslated `showDebug` only option?

MarcoFalke,2018-03-26T19:25:56Z,Might want to add braces `{}` around that to adhere to the coding style for new code and then install `clang-format` and run the https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/master/contrib/devtools#clang-format-diffpy script to preempt whitespace nitpicking.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12792#discussion_r177206395,177206395,src/wallet/wallet.cpp
