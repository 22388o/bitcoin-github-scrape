Diapolo,2012-07-11T11:56:04Z,"Seems all location tags e.g. `<location filename=""../forms/addressbookpage.ui"" line=""14""/>` are removed, you seem to have changed the default lupdate options, was this intended?\n\nI'm interested which full lupdate command-line was used?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1580#issuecomment-6904466,6904466,
laanwj,2012-07-11T11:59:21Z,"I've used `lupdate -no-obsolete -locations none`. By removing the location information, this will result in smaller diffs in the future.  Hopefully it has no harmful side effects, I'm pretty sure that transifex doesn't use the source code location.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1580#issuecomment-6904515,6904515,

laanwj,2012-07-11T12:07:00Z,"Yeah, I guess that needs to be updated badly. There is no command line in there at all. Also not that we use -no-obsolete, and no mention of running `share/qt/extract_strings_qt.py`. \n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1580#issuecomment-6904645,6904645,
