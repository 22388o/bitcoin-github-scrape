Optimizing here is indeed an overall win.\n\n> The logical conclusion is that the miner optimization doesn't make sense. Let's remove it to simplify that part of the code. Less code to maintain and no drawbacks.\n\nThat has been discussed before. Another feature that complicates the internal miner code, and doesn't have much of a point for testing, is support for multiple threads. I'd not be opposed to removing those things. But anything related to the (non-regtest) internal miner has extremely low priority in my eyes. It works ...\n",

    "body": "I guess my point is that the only real use of the of the miner is in regtest mode.\nTherefore everything that is good for regtest mining is good mining in general as far as bitcoin core is concerned. As long as non-regtest mining keeps working, we don't care about its performance.\n#4423 was rejected because the performance measured was hashrate in non-regtest mode, but the only mining performance measure that we should care about is regtest.\nTo be clear, I'm not complaining about this change, it makes a lot of sense and it's great that it's merged.\nBut I think we can make the `if (Params().MineBlocksOnDemand())` part smaller and the whole mining code simpler if we're willing to sacrifice non-regtest performance.\nThere's also another way to make regtest mining more similar to the others: by removing mining code that regtest doesn't use like in #5599 (or @laanwj 's proposal to remove multiple thread support for non-regtest mining). \nTo reiterate and summarize: non-regtest mining performance is meaningless, and non-regtest mining code should be more like regtest mining (instead of the other way around).\n",
