laanwj,2016-11-09T16:05:39Z,"This has come up before in a discussion recently. \n\nHowever, instead of a special-case for regtest I think we should add a command line option to ignore the `getblocktemplate` pre-checks, both this one and the IsInitialBlockDownload - this makes it more general, and avoids switching on the name of the network, which is considered a bad thing.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9116#issuecomment-259451523,259451523,

MarcoFalke,2016-11-10T09:54:23Z,"> Shouldn't regtest be ""always connected""?\n\nProbably not, it depends on your use case. So I agree with @laanwj and we should keep the special cases of regtest to a minimum.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9116#issuecomment-259647613,259647613,

luke-jr,2016-12-02T06:19:45Z,Do the regtest comparison second so it can't incur *any* penalty on normal operation.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9116#discussion_r90592026,90592026,src/rpc/mining.cpp
