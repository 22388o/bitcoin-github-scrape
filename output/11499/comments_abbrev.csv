aria-golliver,2017-10-15T21:33:28Z,"Currently the `ping` column is largest, But I think `User Agent` might be a the best choice. Anecdotally, it also has the longest, with the most interesting information on its right hand side (where it would be hidden if the column was too small). Also some nodes like to put messages/easter eggs in their user agent, so if we made it the bigger-by-default column they'd be easier to discover.\n\nE",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11499#issuecomment-336743257,336743257,

aria-golliver,2017-10-19T00:24:03Z,"@laanwj agreed. I looked through `CNodeStats` to decide what to add and only sent/received bytes seemed interesting to me.\n\nI could maybe imagine someone wanting ""length of time connected to that peer"" or ""per-peer upload/download speeds"", but I think the risk of the table getting too busy is pretty low, and we could always implement a way to select which columns you want a-la `task manager` o",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11499#issuecomment-337764615,337764615,
