I don't really think we should be adding vendor specific code/calls into Bitcoin Core utilities. Or, if it is going to be done, it should be done in some very generic way, otherwise we're likely going to just end up with a bunch of `importfrom*` calls, and more interfaces / backwards compat / supported devices to have to worry about.",
