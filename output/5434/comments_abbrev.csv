gmaxwell,2014-12-06T19:10:54Z,"Shouldn't be updated for this. SSL protocol is controlled by the setting this patch changes, not the cipher suites string.  Confusingly, you can set something like SSLvX in the suites string ... but thats basically filtering ciphers based on what SSL version they were introduced with. ... if you remove all the SSLv3 ciphers it also limits you to TLS 1.2 only, because TLS 1 introduced no ciphers.

aalness,2014-12-08T00:11:48Z,@gmaxwell Yup. It was bugging me so I verified with Wireshark. If the method is <code>ssl::context::tlsv1</code> OpenSSL won't upgrade to TLSv1.2. Seems like odd behavior to me but _shrug_.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5434#issuecomment-65962755,65962755,
