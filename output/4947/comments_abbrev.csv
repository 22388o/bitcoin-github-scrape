theuni,2014-09-20T00:25:18Z,"Seems strange that we need both of these. This construction isn't to spec, so if it works it means the compiler allows it. In that case, I should think it would work both ways. I suspect that only the const iterator ctor is necessary.\n\nEither way, I don't see the downside if it gets msvc building (and passes tests there).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4947#issuecomment-56251047,56251047,

These both look perfectly fine to me:\n\n``` c++\n    CScript(const_iterator pbegin, const_iterator pend) : std::vector<unsigned char>(pbegin, pend) { }\n    CScript(const unsigned char* pbegin, const unsigned char* pend) : std::vector<unsigned char>(pbegin, pend) { }\n```\n\nYou could of course shave one function off by using a templated const",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4947#issuecomment-56262700,56262700,
