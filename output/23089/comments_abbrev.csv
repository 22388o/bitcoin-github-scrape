hebasto,2021-09-25 07:29:55,"Yes, if an ephemeral port by accident belongs to that range a collision is possible. But this range limits only ports of P2P and RPC connections. Our test framework uses ports out of this range in the `feature_bind_extra.py` and `feature_proxy.py`. The former is skipped on Windows, but the latter still could be a source of port collisions.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23089#discussion_r716005674,716005674,.cirrus.yml
