jgarzik,2014-01-30T14:38:32Z,"Was this discussed in IRC and ACK'd there?  No objections to the PR content, but ""add tests"" is something that needs review and multiple ACKs like anything else...   Otherwise we risk setting in stone unreviewed behavior.  These tests are copied into other, non-bitcoind projects as canonical reference tests, so it is critical to make sure these remain correct.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3601#issuecomment-33692903,33692903,
TheBlueMatt,2014-01-30T14:45:04Z,"if you can represent the behavior using valid scripts, then, whether it's expected behavior or not, it defines the protocol. (The obvious exception being some script behavior which represents a potential security risk, which, I would, hope would not be submitted in a pull request)\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3601#issuecomment-33693463,33693463,
sipa,2014-01-30T15:04:57Z,"Ideally, this sort of test should be verified to succeed in multiple (including old) releases. If they do (and the test checks something that is network-visible behaviour), it is clearly a network rule (even if the behaviour is unintentional) and it should be something that other implementations verify. If they don't, we likely have a big problem already.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3601#issuecomment-33695448,33695448,
