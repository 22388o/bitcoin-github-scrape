Xekyo,2018-03-27T16:32:27Z,"As far as I understand, the discard rate is always as big as or bigger than the dustRelayFee. Since it appears that the discard rate is here being used for its eponymous purpose, this seems like a correct change to me.\n\nutACK 5805d6fead8d54ec14bfc89991d692bd75940d56",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12749#issuecomment-376590125,376590125,

sdaftuar,2018-03-28T18:22:15Z,"micro-nit: it looks like we use `IsDust()` in most(?) places in the code, and use GetDustThreshold() directly in just a couple.
