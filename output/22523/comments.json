This command only encrypts only the private key. All other wallet information, such as transactions, is still visible.\n+\n+Note that if the passphrase is lost, all the coins in the wallet will also be lost forever.\n+\n+### 1.3 Backing Up The Wallet\n+\n+Wallets can be safely copied to another destination. This backup file should be stored offline, such as on a USB drive, another computer, or an external hard drive.\n+\n+If the wallet and backup are lost for any reason, the bitcoins related to this wallet will become permanently inaccessible.\n+\n+The command is `bitcoin-cli backupwallet \"destination\"`. The destination parameter must include the name of the file. Otherwise, the command will return an error message like \"Error: Wallet backup failed!\" for descriptor wallets. If it is a legacy wallet, it will be copied and a file will be created with the default file name `wallet.dat`.\n+\n+`$ bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=\"wallet-01\" backupwallet /home/node01/Backups/backup01.dat`\n+\n+### 1.4 Backup Frequency\n+\n+The Bitcoin Core wallet was originally a collection of unrelated private keys with their associated addresses. If a non-HD wallet had generated a key/address, had given that address out and then had restored a backup from before that key's generation, then any funds sent to that address would have been lost definitively.\n+\n+However, [version 0.13](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.13.0.md) introduced HD wallets. Users no longer lose funds when restoring old backups, as long as the addresses used were from the wallet's HD seed (since all private keys can be derived from the seed).\n+\n+So, theoretically, a single backup is enough. But it is recommended to make regular backups (1 time a day or a week) or when there is a relevant amount of new transactions in the wallet.\n+\n+### 1.5 Restoring The Wallet From a Backup\n+\n+To restore a wallet, an empty one must be created  first.  The backup file then rewrites the `wallet.dat` of this new wallet.\n+\n+The user must unload the wallet and load it again after replacing the file.\n+\n+```\n+$ bitcoin-cli createwallet \"restored_wallet\"\n+$ bitcoin-cli unloadwallet \"restored_wallet\"\n+$ cp ~/Backups/backup01.dat ~/.bitcoin/wallets/restored_wallet/wallet.dat\n+$ bitcoin-cli loadwallet \"restored_wallet\"\n+```\n+\n+After these steps, the wallet balance can be checked.\n+\n+`$ bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=\"restored_wallet\" getbalance`\n+\n+### 1.6 `-rescan` and `-reindex`\n+\n+The `-rescan` argument rescans the blockchain for missing wallet transactions during startup.\n+\n+`$ bitcoind -rescan`\n+\n+This is only necessary if there are missing transactions after restoring the wallet.\n+\n+A pruned node, however, is incompatible with the `-rescan` option, since it does not have the data to check for relevant transactions.\n+\n+In that case, it is necessary to restart the node with the `-reindex` command-line option to start over with the initial sync. The wallet will scan for relevant transactions during the synchronization and rediscover the funds and transaction history of the wallet.\n+\n+`$ bitcoind -reindex`\n+\n+### 1.7 Dumping The Wallet\n+\n+Alternatively, the `dumpwallet` command can be used to backup the wallet. It dumps all wallet keys (including the master private key) in a human-readable format into a file.\n+\n+Note that this file is not encrypted and the keys are exposed. An attacker in possession of the file could recreate the wallet and gain access to the keys.\n+\n+The file is generated on the server-side and so the user must have access to the server folders.\n+\n+`$ bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=\"wallet-01\" dumpwallet /home/node01/Backups/dump01.txt`\n+\n+### 1.8 Importing The Wallet From a Dump File\n+\n+The command `importwallet` imports keys from a wallet dump file.\n+\n+The first step is to create a new wallet.\n+\n+`$ bitcoin-cli createwallet \"from_dump_file\"`\n+\n+Then this command can be called.\n+\n+`$ bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=\"from_dump_file\" importwallet /home/node01/Backups/dump01.txt`\n+",

If the node is running on testnet, the wallets are created in `~/.bitcoin/testnet3/wallets/wallet_name` or if signet, `~/.bitcoin/signet/wallets/wallet_name`.\n+\n+### 1.2 Encrypting The Wallet\n+\n+The `wallet.dat` file is not encrypted by default and is, therefore, vulnerable if an attacker gains access to the device where the wallet or the backups are stored.\n+\n+The wallet must be encrypted with the following command:\n+\n+`$ bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=\"wallet-01\" encryptwallet \"passphrase\"`\n+\n+The `encryptwallet` command is used only when the wallet has not been encrypted yet. Otherwise, the `walletpassphrasechange` command should be used.\n+\n+`$ bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=\"wallet-01\" walletpassphrasechange \"oldpassphrase\" \"newpassphrase\"`\n+\n+The `-rpcwallet` is the name of the wallet that will be encrypted.\n+\n+The term \"encrypt the wallet\" used here is not very accurate. This command only encrypts only the private key. All other wallet information, such as transactions, is still visible.\n+\n+Note that if the passphrase is lost, all the coins in the wallet will also be lost forever.\n+\n+### 1.3 Backing Up The Wallet\n+\n+Wallets can be safely copied to another destination. This backup file should be stored offline, such as on a USB drive, another computer, or an external hard drive.\n+\n+If the wallet and backup are lost for any reason, the bitcoins related to this wallet will become permanently inaccessible.\n+\n+The command is `bitcoin-cli backupwallet \"destination\"`. The destination parameter must include the name of the file. Otherwise, the command will return an error message like \"Error: Wallet backup failed!\" for descriptor wallets. If it is a legacy wallet, it will be copied and a file will be created with the default file name `wallet.dat`.\n+\n+`$ bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=\"wallet-01\" backupwallet /home/node01/Backups/backup01.dat`\n+\n+### 1.4 Backup Frequency\n+\n+The Bitcoin Core wallet was originally a collection of unrelated private keys with their associated addresses. If a non-HD wallet had generated a key/address, had given that address out and then had restored a backup from before that key's generation, then any funds sent to that address would have been lost definitively.\n+\n+However, [version 0.13](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.13.0.md) introduced HD wallets. Users no longer lose funds when restoring old backups, as long as the addresses used were from the wallet's HD seed (since all private keys can be derived from the seed).\n+\n+So, theoretically, a single backup is enough. But it is recommended to make regular backups (1 time a day or a week) or when there is a relevant amount of new transactions in the wallet.\n+\n+### 1.5 Restoring The Wallet From a Backup\n+\n+To restore a wallet, an empty one must be created  first.  The backup file then rewrites the `wallet.dat` of this new wallet.\n+\n+The user must unload the wallet and load it again after replacing the file.\n+\n+```\n+$ bitcoin-cli createwallet \"restored_wallet\"\n+$ bitcoin-cli unloadwallet \"restored_wallet\"\n+$ cp ~/Backups/backup01.dat ~/.bitcoin/wallets/restored_wallet/wallet.dat\n+$ bitcoin-cli loadwallet \"restored_wallet\"\n+```\n+\n+After these steps, the wallet balance can be checked.\n+\n+`$ bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=\"restored_wallet\" getbalance`\n+\n+### 1.6 `-rescan` and `-reindex`\n+\n+The `-rescan` argument rescans the blockchain for missing wallet transactions during startup.\n+\n+`$ bitcoind -rescan`\n+\n+This is only necessary if there are missing transactions after restoring the wallet.\n+\n+A pruned node, however, is incompatible with the `-rescan` option, since it does not have the data to check for relevant transactions.\n+\n+In that case, it is necessary to restart the node with the `-reindex` command-line option to start over with the initial sync. The wallet will scan for relevant transactions during the synchronization and rediscover the funds and transaction history of the wallet.\n+\n+`$ bitcoind -reindex`\n+\n+### 1.7 Dumping The Wallet\n+\n+Alternatively, the `dumpwallet` command can be used to backup the wallet. It dumps all wallet keys (including the master private key) in a human-readable format into a file.\n+\n+Note that this file is not encrypted and the keys are exposed. An attacker in possession of the file could recreate the wallet and gain access to the keys.\n+\n+The file is generated on the server-side and so the user must have access to the server folders.\n+\n+`$ bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=\"wallet-01\" dumpwallet /home/node01/Backups/dump01.txt`\n+\n+### 1.8 Importing The Wallet From a Dump File\n+\n+The command `importwallet` imports keys from a wallet dump file.",

Backing Up and Restoring The Wallet\n+\n+### 1.1 Creating The Wallet\n+\n+Since version 0.21, Bitcoin Core no longer has a default wallet.\n+Wallets can be created with the RPC command `createwallet`. More information about this command can be found running `bitcoin-cli help createwallet`.\n+\n+The following command, for example, creates a descriptor wallet:\n+\n+`$ bitcoin-cli -named createwallet wallet_name=\"wallet01\" descriptors=true`\n+\n+If the node is running on testnet network, `-testnet` parameter should be added. Or `-signet` if on signet.\n+\n+`$ bitcoin-cli -testnet -named createwallet wallet_name=\"wallet01\" descriptors=true`\n+\n+The `descriptors` parameter can be omitted if the intention is to create a legacy wallet.\n+\n+For now, the default type is the legacy wallet, but that should change in the near future.\n+\n+By default, wallets are created in the `~/.bitcoin/wallets/wallet_name` folder.

Otherwise, the `walletpassphrasechange` command should be used.\n+\n+`$ bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=\"wallet-01\" walletpassphrasechange \"oldpassphrase\" \"newpassphrase\"`\n+\n+The `-rpcwallet` is the name of the wallet that will be encrypted.\n+\n+The term \"encrypt the wallet\" used here is not very accurate. This command only encrypts only the private key. All other wallet information, such as transactions, is still visible.\n+\n+Note that if the passphrase is lost, all the coins in the wallet will also be lost forever.\n+\n+### 1.3 Backing Up The Wallet\n+\n+Wallets can be safely copied to another destination. This backup file should be stored offline, such as on a USB drive, another computer, or an external hard drive.\n+\n+If the wallet and backup are lost for any reason, the bitcoins related to this wallet will become permanently inaccessible.\n+\n+The command is `bitcoin-cli backupwallet \"destination\"`.

The wallet will scan for relevant transactions during the synchronization and rediscover the funds and transaction history of the wallet.\n+\n+`$ bitcoind -reindex`\n+\n+### 1.7 Dumping The Wallet\n+\n+Alternatively, the `dumpwallet` command can be used to backup the wallet. It dumps all wallet keys (including the master private key) in a human-readable format into a file.",

Backing Up and Restoring The Wallet\n+\n+### 1.1 Creating The Wallet\n+\n+Since version 0.21, Bitcoin Core no longer has a default wallet.\n+Wallets can be created with the RPC command `createwallet`. More information about this command can be found running `bitcoin-cli help createwallet`.\n+\n+The following command, for example, creates a descriptor wallet:\n+\n+`$ bitcoin-cli -named createwallet wallet_name=\"wallet01\" descriptors=true`\n+\n+If the node is running on testnet network, `-testnet` parameter should be added. Or `-signet` if on signet.\n+\n+`$ bitcoin-cli -testnet -named createwallet wallet_name=\"wallet01\" descriptors=true`\n+\n+The `descriptors` parameter can be omitted if the intention is to create a legacy wallet.\n+\n+For now, the default type is the legacy wallet, but that should change in the near future.\n+\n+By default, wallets are created in the `~/.bitcoin/wallets/wallet_name` folder. If the node is running on testnet, the wallets are created in `~/.bitcoin/testnet3/wallets/wallet_name` or if signet, `~/.bitcoin/signet/wallets/wallet_name`.\n+\n+### 1.2 Encrypting The Wallet\n+\n+The `wallet.dat` file is not encrypted by default and is, therefore, vulnerable if an attacker gains access to the device where the wallet or the backups are stored.\n+\n+The wallet must be encrypted with the following command:\n+\n+`$ bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=\"wallet-01\" encryptwallet \"passphrase\"`\n+\n+The `encryptwallet` command is used only when the wallet has not been encrypted yet. Otherwise, the `walletpassphrasechange` command should be used.\n+\n+`$ bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=\"wallet-01\" walletpassphrasechange \"oldpassphrase\" \"newpassphrase\"`\n+\n+The `-rpcwallet` is the name of the wallet that will be encrypted.\n+\n+The term \"encrypt the wallet\" used here is not very accurate. This command only encrypts only the private key. All other wallet information, such as transactions, is still visible.\n+\n+Note that if the passphrase is lost, all the coins in the wallet will also be lost forever.\n+\n+### 1.3 Backing Up The Wallet\n+\n+Wallets can be safely copied to another destination. This backup file should be stored offline, such as on a USB drive, another computer, or an external hard drive.\n+\n+If the wallet and backup are lost for any reason, the bitcoins related to this wallet will become permanently inaccessible.\n+\n+The command is `bitcoin-cli backupwallet \"destination\"`. The destination parameter must include the name of the file. Otherwise, the command will return an error message like \"Error: Wallet backup failed!\" for descriptor wallets. If it is a legacy wallet, it will be copied and a file will be created with the default file name `wallet.dat`.\n+\n+`$ bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=\"wallet-01\" backupwallet /home/node01/Backups/backup01.dat`\n+\n+### 1.4 Backup Frequency\n+\n+The Bitcoin Core wallet was originally a collection of unrelated private keys with their associated addresses. If a non-HD wallet had generated a key/address, had given that address out and then had restored a backup from before that key's generation, then any funds sent to that address would have been lost definitively.",

Backing Up and Restoring The Wallet\n+\n+### 1.1 Creating The Wallet\n+\n+Since version 0.21, Bitcoin Core no longer has a default wallet.\n+Wallets can be created with the RPC command `createwallet`. More information about this command can be found running `bitcoin-cli help createwallet`.\n+\n+The following command, for example, creates a descriptor wallet:\n+\n+`$ bitcoin-cli -named createwallet wallet_name=\"wallet01\" descriptors=true`\n+\n+If the node is running on testnet network, `-testnet` parameter should be added. Or `-signet` if on signet.\n+\n+`$ bitcoin-cli -testnet -named createwallet wallet_name=\"wallet01\" descriptors=true`\n+\n+The `descriptors` parameter can be omitted if the intention is to create a legacy wallet.\n+\n+For now, the default type is the legacy wallet, but that should change in the near future.\n+\n+By default, wallets are created in the `~/.bitcoin/wallets/wallet_name` folder. If the node is running on testnet, the wallets are created in `~/.bitcoin/testnet3/wallets/wallet_name` or if signet, `~/.bitcoin/signet/wallets/wallet_name`.\n+\n+### 1.2 Encrypting The Wallet\n+\n+The `wallet.dat` file is not encrypted by default and is, therefore, vulnerable if an attacker gains access to the device where the wallet or the backups are stored.\n+\n+The wallet must be encrypted with the following command:\n+\n+`$ bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=\"wallet-01\" encryptwallet \"passphrase\"`\n+\n+The `encryptwallet` command is used only when the wallet has not been encrypted yet. Otherwise, the `walletpassphrasechange` command should be used.\n+\n+`$ bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=\"wallet-01\" walletpassphrasechange \"oldpassphrase\" \"newpassphrase\"`\n+\n+The `-rpcwallet` is the name of the wallet that will be encrypted.\n+\n+The term \"encrypt the wallet\" used here is not very accurate. This command only encrypts only the private key. All other wallet information, such as transactions, is still visible.\n+\n+Note that if the passphrase is lost, all the coins in the wallet will also be lost forever.\n+\n+### 1.3 Backing Up The Wallet\n+\n+Wallets can be safely copied to another destination. This backup file should be stored offline, such as on a USB drive, another computer, or an external hard drive.\n+\n+If the wallet and backup are lost for any reason, the bitcoins related to this wallet will become permanently inaccessible.\n+\n+The command is `bitcoin-cli backupwallet \"destination\"`. The destination parameter must include the name of the file. Otherwise, the command will return an error message like \"Error: Wallet backup failed!\" for descriptor wallets. If it is a legacy wallet, it will be copied and a file will be created with the default file name `wallet.dat`.\n+\n+`$ bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=\"wallet-01\" backupwallet /home/node01/Backups/backup01.dat`\n+\n+### 1.4 Backup Frequency\n+\n+The Bitcoin Core wallet was originally a collection of unrelated private keys with their associated addresses. If a non-HD wallet had generated a key/address, had given that address out and then had restored a backup from before that key's generation, then any funds sent to that address would have been lost definitively.\n+\n+However, [version 0.13](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.13.0.md) introduced HD wallets. Users no longer lose funds when restoring old backups, as long as the addresses used were from the wallet's HD seed (since all private keys can be derived from the seed).\n+\n+So, theoretically, a single backup is enough. But it is recommended to make regular backups (1 time a day or a week) or when there is a relevant amount of new transactions in the wallet.\n+\n+### 1.5 Restoring The Wallet From a Backup\n+\n+To restore a wallet, an empty one must be created  first.  The backup file then rewrites the `wallet.dat` of this new wallet.",

Backing Up and Restoring The Wallet\n+\n+### 1.1 Creating The Wallet\n+\n+Since version 0.21, Bitcoin Core no longer has a default wallet.\n+Wallets can be created with the RPC command `createwallet`. More information about this command can be found running `bitcoin-cli help createwallet`.\n+\n+The following command, for example, creates a descriptor wallet:\n+\n+`$ bitcoin-cli -named createwallet wallet_name=\"wallet01\" descriptors=true`\n+\n+If the node is running on testnet network, `-testnet` parameter should be added. Or `-signet` if on signet.\n+\n+`$ bitcoin-cli -testnet -named createwallet wallet_name=\"wallet01\" descriptors=true`\n+\n+The `descriptors` parameter can be omitted if the intention is to create a legacy wallet.\n+\n+For now, the default type is the legacy wallet, but that should change in the near future.\n+\n+By default, wallets are created in the `~/.bitcoin/wallets/wallet_name` folder. If the node is running on testnet, the wallets are created in `~/.bitcoin/testnet3/wallets/wallet_name` or if signet, `~/.bitcoin/signet/wallets/wallet_name`.\n+\n+### 1.2 Encrypting The Wallet\n+\n+The `wallet.dat` file is not encrypted by default and is, therefore, vulnerable if an attacker gains access to the device where the wallet or the backups are stored.\n+\n+The wallet must be encrypted with the following command:\n+\n+`$ bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=\"wallet-01\" encryptwallet \"passphrase\"`\n+\n+The `encryptwallet` command is used only when the wallet has not been encrypted yet. Otherwise, the `walletpassphrasechange` command should be used.\n+\n+`$ bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=\"wallet-01\" walletpassphrasechange \"oldpassphrase\" \"newpassphrase\"`\n+\n+The `-rpcwallet` is the name of the wallet that will be encrypted.\n+\n+The term \"encrypt the wallet\" used here is not very accurate. This command only encrypts only the private key. All other wallet information, such as transactions, is still visible.\n+\n+Note that if the passphrase is lost, all the coins in the wallet will also be lost forever.\n+\n+### 1.3 Backing Up The Wallet\n+\n+Wallets can be safely copied to another destination. This backup file should be stored offline, such as on a USB drive, another computer, or an external hard drive.\n+\n+If the wallet and backup are lost for any reason, the bitcoins related to this wallet will become permanently inaccessible.\n+\n+The command is `bitcoin-cli backupwallet \"destination\"`. The destination parameter must include the name of the file. Otherwise, the command will return an error message like \"Error: Wallet backup failed!\" for descriptor wallets. If it is a legacy wallet, it will be copied and a file will be created with the default file name `wallet.dat`.\n+\n+`$ bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=\"wallet-01\" backupwallet /home/node01/Backups/backup01.dat`\n+\n+### 1.4 Backup Frequency\n+\n+The Bitcoin Core wallet was originally a collection of unrelated private keys with their associated addresses. If a non-HD wallet had generated a key/address, had given that address out and then had restored a backup from before that key's generation, then any funds sent to that address would have been lost definitively.\n+\n+However, [version 0.13](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.13.0.md) introduced HD wallets. Users no longer lose funds when restoring old backups, as long as the addresses used were from the wallet's HD seed (since all private keys can be derived from the seed).\n+\n+So, theoretically, a single backup is enough. But it is recommended to make regular backups (1 time a day or a week) or when there is a relevant amount of new transactions in the wallet.\n+\n+### 1.5 Restoring The Wallet From a Backup\n+\n+To restore a wallet, an empty one must be created  first.  The backup file then rewrites the `wallet.dat` of this new wallet.\n+\n+The user must unload the wallet and load it again after replacing the file.\n+\n+```\n+$ bitcoin-cli createwallet \"restored_wallet\"\n+$ bitcoin-cli unloadwallet \"restored_wallet\"\n+$ cp ~/Backups/backup01.dat ~/.bitcoin/wallets/restored_wallet/wallet.dat\n+$ bitcoin-cli loadwallet \"restored_wallet\"\n+```\n+\n+After these steps, the wallet balance can be checked.\n+\n+`$ bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=\"restored_wallet\" getbalance`\n+\n+### 1.6 `-rescan` and `-reindex`\n+\n+The `-rescan` argument rescans the blockchain for missing wallet transactions during startup.\n+\n+`$ bitcoind -rescan`\n+\n+This is only necessary if there are missing transactions after restoring the wallet.\n+\n+A pruned node, however, is incompatible with the `-rescan` option, since it does not have the data to check for relevant transactions.\n+\n+In that case, it is necessary to restart the node with the `-reindex` command-line option to start over with the initial sync. The wallet will scan for relevant transactions during the synchronization and rediscover the funds and transaction history of the wallet.\n+\n+`$ bitcoind -reindex`\n+\n+### 1.7 Dumping The Wallet\n+\n+Alternatively, the `dumpwallet` command can be used to backup the wallet. It dumps all wallet keys (including the master private key) in a human-readable format into a file.\n+\n+Note that this file is not encrypted and the keys are exposed. An attacker in possession of the file could recreate the wallet and gain access to the keys.\n+\n+The file is generated on the server-side and so the user must have access to the server folders.",

This backup file should be stored offline, such as on a USB drive, another computer, or an external hard drive.\n+\n+If the wallet and backup are lost for any reason, the bitcoins related to this wallet will become permanently inaccessible.\n+\n+The command is `bitcoin-cli backupwallet \"destination\"`. The destination parameter must include the name of the file. Otherwise, the command will return an error message like \"Error: Wallet backup failed!\" for descriptor wallets. If it is a legacy wallet, it will be copied and a file will be created with the default file name `wallet.dat`.\n+\n+`$ bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=\"wallet-01\" backupwallet /home/node01/Backups/backup01.dat`\n+\n+### 1.4 Backup Frequency\n+\n+The Bitcoin Core wallet was originally a collection of unrelated private keys with their associated addresses. If a non-HD wallet had generated a key/address, had given that address out and then had restored a backup from before that key's generation, then any funds sent to that address would have been lost definitively.\n+\n+However, [version 0.13](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.13.0.md) introduced HD wallets. Users no longer lose funds when restoring old backups, as long as the addresses used were from the wallet's HD seed (since all private keys can be derived from the seed).\n+\n+So, theoretically, a single backup is enough. But it is recommended to make regular backups (1 time a day or a week) or when there is a relevant amount of new transactions in the wallet.\n+\n+### 1.5 Restoring The Wallet From a Backup\n+\n+To restore a wallet, an empty one must be created  first.  The backup file then rewrites the `wallet.dat` of this new wallet.\n+\n+The user must unload the wallet and load it again after replacing the file.\n+\n+```\n+$ bitcoin-cli createwallet \"restored_wallet\"\n+$ bitcoin-cli unloadwallet \"restored_wallet\"\n+$ cp ~/Backups/backup01.dat ~/.bitcoin/wallets/restored_wallet/wallet.dat\n+$ bitcoin-cli loadwallet \"restored_wallet\"\n+```\n+\n+After these steps, the wallet balance can be checked.\n+\n+`$ bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=\"restored_wallet\" getbalance`\n+\n+### 1.6 `-rescan` and `-reindex`\n+\n+The `-rescan` argument rescans the blockchain for missing wallet transactions during startup.\n+\n+`$ bitcoind -rescan`\n+\n+This is only necessary if there are missing transactions after restoring the wallet.\n+\n+A pruned node, however, is incompatible with the `-rescan` option, since it does not have the data to check for relevant transactions.\n+\n+In that case, it is necessary to restart the node with the `-reindex` command-line option to start over with the initial sync. The wallet will scan for relevant transactions during the synchronization and rediscover the funds and transaction history of the wallet.\n+\n+`$ bitcoind -reindex`\n+\n+### 1.7 Dumping The Wallet\n+\n+Alternatively, the `dumpwallet` command can be used to backup the wallet. It dumps all wallet keys (including the master private key) in a human-readable format into a file.\n+\n+Note that this file is not encrypted and the keys are exposed. An attacker in possession of the file could recreate the wallet and gain access to the keys.\n+\n+The file is generated on the server-side and so the user must have access to the server folders.\n+\n+`$ bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=\"wallet-01\" dumpwallet /home/node01/Backups/dump01.txt`\n+\n+### 1.8 Importing The Wallet From a Dump File\n+\n+The command `importwallet` imports keys from a wallet dump file.",

The destination parameter must include the name of the file. Otherwise, the command will return an error message like \"Error: Wallet backup failed!\" for descriptor wallets. If it is a legacy wallet, it will be copied and a file will be created with the default file name `wallet.dat`.\n+\n+`$ bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=\"wallet-01\" backupwallet /home/node01/Backups/backup01.dat`\n+\n+### 1.4 Backup Frequency\n+\n+The Bitcoin Core wallet was originally a collection of unrelated private keys with their associated addresses. If a non-HD wallet had generated a key/address, had given that address out and then had restored a backup from before that key's generation, then any funds sent to that address would have been lost definitively.\n+\n+However, [version 0.13](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.13.0.md) introduced HD wallets. Users no longer lose funds when restoring old backups, as long as the addresses used were from the wallet's HD seed (since all private keys can be derived from the seed).\n+\n+So, theoretically, a single backup is enough. But it is recommended to make regular backups (1 time a day or a week) or when there is a relevant amount of new transactions in the wallet.\n+\n+### 1.5 Restoring The Wallet From a Backup\n+\n+To restore a wallet, an empty one must be created  first.  The backup file then rewrites the `wallet.dat` of this new wallet.\n+\n+The user must unload the wallet and load it again after replacing the file.\n+\n+```\n+$ bitcoin-cli createwallet \"restored_wallet\"\n+$ bitcoin-cli unloadwallet \"restored_wallet\"\n+$ cp ~/Backups/backup01.dat ~/.bitcoin/wallets/restored_wallet/wallet.dat\n+$ bitcoin-cli loadwallet \"restored_wallet\"\n+```\n+\n+After these steps, the wallet balance can be checked.\n+\n+`$ bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=\"restored_wallet\" getbalance`\n+\n+### 1.6 `-rescan` and `-reindex`\n+\n+The `-rescan` argument rescans the blockchain for missing wallet transactions during startup.\n+\n+`$ bitcoind -rescan`\n+\n+This is only necessary if there are missing transactions after restoring the wallet.\n+\n+A pruned node, however, is incompatible with the `-rescan` option, since it does not have the data to check for relevant transactions.\n+\n+In that case, it is necessary to restart the node with the `-reindex` command-line option to start over with the initial sync. The wallet will scan for relevant transactions during the synchronization and rediscover the funds and transaction history of the wallet.\n+\n+`$ bitcoind -reindex`\n+\n+### 1.7 Dumping The Wallet\n+\n+Alternatively, the `dumpwallet` command can be used to backup the wallet. It dumps all wallet keys (including the master private key) in a human-readable format into a file.\n+\n+Note that this file is not encrypted and the keys are exposed. An attacker in possession of the file could recreate the wallet and gain access to the keys.\n+\n+The file is generated on the server-side and so the user must have access to the server folders.\n+\n+`$ bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=\"wallet-01\" dumpwallet /home/node01/Backups/dump01.txt`\n+\n+### 1.8 Importing The Wallet From a Dump File\n+\n+The command `importwallet` imports keys from a wallet dump file.",

If it is a legacy wallet, it will be copied and a file will be created with the default file name `wallet.dat`.\n+\n+`$ bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=\"wallet-01\" backupwallet /home/node01/Backups/backup01.dat`\n+\n+### 1.4 Backup Frequency\n+\n+The Bitcoin Core wallet was originally a collection of unrelated private keys with their associated addresses. If a non-HD wallet had generated a key/address, had given that address out and then had restored a backup from before that key's generation, then any funds sent to that address would have been lost definitively.\n+\n+However, [version 0.13](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.13.0.md) introduced HD wallets. Users no longer lose funds when restoring old backups, as long as the addresses used were from the wallet's HD seed (since all private keys can be derived from the seed).\n+\n+So, theoretically, a single backup is enough. But it is recommended to make regular backups (1 time a day or a week) or when there is a relevant amount of new transactions in the wallet.\n+\n+### 1.5 Restoring The Wallet From a Backup\n+\n+To restore a wallet, an empty one must be created  first.  The backup file then rewrites the `wallet.dat` of this new wallet.\n+\n+The user must unload the wallet and load it again after replacing the file.\n+\n+```\n+$ bitcoin-cli createwallet \"restored_wallet\"\n+$ bitcoin-cli unloadwallet \"restored_wallet\"\n+$ cp ~/Backups/backup01.dat ~/.bitcoin/wallets/restored_wallet/wallet.dat\n+$ bitcoin-cli loadwallet \"restored_wallet\"\n+```\n+\n+After these steps, the wallet balance can be checked.\n+\n+`$ bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=\"restored_wallet\" getbalance`\n+\n+### 1.6 `-rescan` and `-reindex`\n+\n+The `-rescan` argument rescans the blockchain for missing wallet transactions during startup.\n+\n+`$ bitcoind -rescan`\n+\n+This is only necessary if there are missing transactions after restoring the wallet.\n+\n+A pruned node, however, is incompatible with the `-rescan` option, since it does not have the data to check for relevant transactions.\n+\n+In that case, it is necessary to restart the node with the `-reindex` command-line option to start over with the initial sync. The wallet will scan for relevant transactions during the synchronization and rediscover the funds and transaction history of the wallet.\n+\n+`$ bitcoind -reindex`\n+\n+### 1.7 Dumping The Wallet\n+\n+Alternatively, the `dumpwallet` command can be used to backup the wallet. It dumps all wallet keys (including the master private key) in a human-readable format into a file.\n+\n+Note that this file is not encrypted and the keys are exposed. An attacker in possession of the file could recreate the wallet and gain access to the keys.\n+\n+The file is generated on the server-side and so the user must have access to the server folders.\n+\n+`$ bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=\"wallet-01\" dumpwallet /home/node01/Backups/dump01.txt`\n+\n+### 1.8 Importing The Wallet From a Dump File\n+\n+The command `importwallet` imports keys from a wallet dump file.",

Users no longer lose funds when restoring old backups, as long as the addresses used were from the wallet's HD seed (since all private keys can be derived from the seed).\n+\n+So, theoretically, a single backup is enough. But it is recommended to make regular backups (1 time a day or a week) or when there is a relevant amount of new transactions in the wallet.\n+\n+### 1.5 Restoring The Wallet From a Backup\n+\n+To restore a wallet, an empty one must be created  first.  The backup file then rewrites the `wallet.dat` of this new wallet.\n+\n+The user must unload the wallet and load it again after replacing the file.\n+\n+```\n+$ bitcoin-cli createwallet \"restored_wallet\"\n+$ bitcoin-cli unloadwallet \"restored_wallet\"\n+$ cp ~/Backups/backup01.dat ~/.bitcoin/wallets/restored_wallet/wallet.dat\n+$ bitcoin-cli loadwallet \"restored_wallet\"\n+```\n+\n+After these steps, the wallet balance can be checked.\n+\n+`$ bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=\"restored_wallet\" getbalance`\n+\n+### 1.6 `-rescan` and `-reindex`\n+\n+The `-rescan` argument rescans the blockchain for missing wallet transactions during startup.\n+\n+`$ bitcoind -rescan`\n+\n+This is only necessary if there are missing transactions after restoring the wallet.",

    "diff_hunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,115 @@\n+# Managing The Wallet\n+\n+## 1. Backing Up and Restoring The Wallet\n+\n+### 1.1 Creating The Wallet\n+\n+Since version 0.21, Bitcoin Core no longer has a default wallet.\n+Wallets can be created with the RPC command `createwallet`. More information about this command can be found running `bitcoin-cli help createwallet`.\n+\n+The following command, for example, creates a descriptor wallet:\n+\n+`$ bitcoin-cli -named createwallet wallet_name=\"wallet01\" descriptors=true`\n+\n+If the node is running on testnet network, `-testnet` parameter should be added. Or `-signet` if on signet.\n+\n+`$ bitcoin-cli -testnet -named createwallet wallet_name=\"wallet01\" descriptors=true`\n+\n+The `descriptors` parameter can be omitted if the intention is to create a legacy wallet.\n+\n+For now, the default type is the legacy wallet, but that should change in the near future.\n+\n+By default, wallets are created in the `~/.bitcoin/wallets/wallet_name` folder. If the node is running on testnet, the wallets are created in `~/.bitcoin/testnet3/wallets/wallet_name` or if signet, `~/.bitcoin/signet/wallets/wallet_name`.\n+\n+### 1.2 Encrypting The Wallet\n+\n+The `wallet.dat` file is not encrypted by default and is, therefore, vulnerable if an attacker gains access to the device where the wallet or the backups are stored.\n+\n+The wallet must be encrypted with the following command:\n+\n+`$ bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=\"wallet-01\" encryptwallet \"passphrase\"`\n+\n+The `encryptwallet` command is used only when the wallet has not been encrypted yet. Otherwise, the `walletpassphrasechange` command should be used.\n+\n+`$ bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=\"wallet-01\" walletpassphrasechange \"oldpassphrase\" \"newpassphrase\"`\n+\n+The `-rpcwallet` is the name of the wallet that will be encrypted.\n+\n+The term \"encrypt the wallet\" used here is not very accurate. This command only encrypts only the private key. All other wallet information, such as transactions, is still visible.\n+\n+Note that if the passphrase is lost, all the coins in the wallet will also be lost forever.\n+\n+### 1.3 Backing Up The Wallet\n+\n+Wallets can be safely copied to another destination. This backup file should be stored offline, such as on a USB drive, another computer, or an external hard drive.\n+\n+If the wallet and backup are lost for any reason, the bitcoins related to this wallet will become permanently inaccessible.\n+\n+The command is `bitcoin-cli backupwallet \"destination\"`. The destination parameter must include the name of the file. Otherwise, the command will return an error message like \"Error: Wallet backup failed!\" for descriptor wallets. If it is a legacy wallet, it will be copied and a file will be created with the default file name `wallet.dat`.\n+\n+`$ bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=\"wallet-01\" backupwallet /home/node01/Backups/backup01.dat`\n+\n+### 1.4 Backup Frequency\n+\n+The Bitcoin Core wallet was originally a collection of unrelated private keys with their associated addresses. If a non-HD wallet had generated a key/address, had given that address out and then had restored a backup from before that key's generation, then any funds sent to that address would have been lost definitively.\n+\n+However, [version 0.13](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.13.0.md) introduced HD wallets.

But it is recommended to make regular backups (1 time a day or a week) or when there is a relevant amount of new transactions in the wallet.\n+\n+### 1.5 Restoring The Wallet From a Backup\n+\n+To restore a wallet, an empty one must be created  first.  The backup file then rewrites the `wallet.dat` of this new wallet.\n+\n+The user must unload the wallet and load it again after replacing the file.\n+\n+```\n+$ bitcoin-cli createwallet \"restored_wallet\"\n+$ bitcoin-cli unloadwallet \"restored_wallet\"\n+$ cp ~/Backups/backup01.dat ~/.bitcoin/wallets/restored_wallet/wallet.dat\n+$ bitcoin-cli loadwallet \"restored_wallet\"\n+```\n+\n+After these steps, the wallet balance can be checked.\n+\n+`$ bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=\"restored_wallet\" getbalance`\n+\n+### 1.6 `-rescan` and `-reindex`\n+\n+The `-rescan` argument rescans the blockchain for missing wallet transactions during startup.\n+\n+`$ bitcoind -rescan`\n+\n+This is only necessary if there are missing transactions after restoring the wallet.\n+\n+A pruned node, however, is incompatible with the `-rescan` option, since it does not have the data to check for relevant transactions.\n+\n+In that case, it is necessary to restart the node with the `-reindex` command-line option to start over with the initial sync. The wallet will scan for relevant transactions during the synchronization and rediscover the funds and transaction history of the wallet.\n+\n+`$ bitcoind -reindex`\n+\n+### 1.7 Dumping The Wallet\n+\n+Alternatively, the `dumpwallet` command can be used to backup the wallet. It dumps all wallet keys (including the master private key) in a human-readable format into a file.",

If it is a legacy wallet, it will be copied and a file will be created with the default file name `wallet.dat`.\n+\n+`$ bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=\"wallet-01\" backupwallet /home/node01/Backups/backup-01.dat`\n+\n+### 1.4 Backup Frequency\n+\n+The original Bitcoin Core wallet was a collection of unrelated private keys. If a non-HD wallet had received funds to an address and then restored from a backup made before the address was generated, then any funds sent to said address are lost forever because there's no deterministic mechanism to derive that address again.\n+\n+However, [version 0.13](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.13.0.md) introduced a deterministic mechanism from which to derive keys; HD wallets. Users no longer lose funds when restoring old backups because all addresses are derived from the HD wallet seed.\n+\n+This means that a single backup is enough to recover the coins at any time. It is still recommended to make regular backups (once a week) or after a significant amount of new transactions to keep the metadata such as labels.\n+\n+Metadata cannot be retrieved from a blockchain rescan, so if the backup is too old, it will be lost forever.",

This backup file should be stored on offline devices only, such as on a USB drive or an external hard drive.\n+\n+If the wallet and backup are lost for any reason, the bitcoins related to this wallet will become permanently inaccessible.\n+\n+The `backupwallet` RPC or the `Backup Wallet` GUI menu item must be used to ensure the file is in a safe state when the copy is made. The destination parameter must include the name of the file. Otherwise, the command will return an error message like \"Error: Wallet backup failed!\" for descriptor wallets. If it is a legacy wallet, it will be copied and a file will be created with the default file name `wallet.dat`.\n+\n+`$ bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=\"wallet-01\" backupwallet /home/node01/Backups/backup-01.dat`\n+\n+### 1.4 Backup Frequency\n+\n+The original Bitcoin Core wallet was a collection of unrelated private keys. If a non-HD wallet had received funds to an address and then was restored from a backup made before the address was generated, then any funds sent to that address would have been lost because there was no deterministic mechanism to derive the address again.\n+\n+Bitcoin Core [version 0.13](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.13.0.md) introduced HD wallets with deterministic key derivation. With HD wallets, users no longer lose funds when restoring old backups because all addresses are derived from the HD wallet seed.\n+\n+This means that a single backup is enough to recover the coins at any time. It is still recommended to make regular backups (once a week) or after a significant number of new transactions to maintain the metadata, such as labels. Metadata cannot be retrieved from a blockchain rescan, so if the backup is too old, the metadata will be lost forever.\n+\n+Wallets created before version 0.13 are not HD and must be backed up every 100 keys used since the previous backup, or even more often to maintain the metadata.\n+\n+### 1.5 Restoring the Wallet From a Backup\n+\n+To restore a wallet, an empty one must be created first. The backup file then rewrites the `wallet.dat` of this new wallet.",

If a non-HD wallet had received funds to an address and then was restored from a backup made before the address was generated, then any funds sent to that address would have been lost because there was no deterministic mechanism to derive the address again.\n+\n+Bitcoin Core [version 0.13](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.13.0.md) introduced HD wallets with deterministic key derivation. With HD wallets, users no longer lose funds when restoring old backups because all addresses are derived from the HD wallet seed.\n+\n+This means that a single backup is enough to recover the coins at any time. It is still recommended to make regular backups (once a week) or after a significant number of new transactions to maintain the metadata, such as labels. Metadata cannot be retrieved from a blockchain rescan, so if the backup is too old, the metadata will be lost forever.\n+\n+Wallets created before version 0.13 are not HD and must be backed up every 100 keys used since the previous backup, or even more often to maintain the metadata.\n+\n+### 1.5 Restoring the Wallet From a Backup\n+\n+To restore a wallet, an empty one must be created first. The backup file then rewrites the `wallet.dat` of this new wallet.",

However, this solution significantly increases the risk of losing coins due to forgotten passphrases. There is no way to recover a passphrase.

Backup files can be regularly tested to avoid problems in the future.\n+\n+If the wallet and backup are lost for any reason, the bitcoins related to this wallet will become permanently inaccessible.\n+\n+### 1.4 Backup Frequency\n+\n+The original Bitcoin Core wallet was a collection of unrelated private keys. If a non-HD wallet had received funds to an address and then was restored from a backup made before the address was generated, then any funds sent to that address would have been lost because there was no deterministic mechanism to derive the address again.\n+\n+Bitcoin Core [version 0.13](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.13.0.md) introduced HD wallets with deterministic key derivation. With HD wallets, users no longer lose funds when restoring old backups because all addresses are derived from the HD wallet seed.\n+\n+This means that a single backup is enough to recover the coins at any time. It is still recommended to make regular backups (once a week) or after a significant number of new transactions to maintain the metadata, such as labels. Metadata cannot be retrieved from a blockchain rescan, so if the backup is too old, the metadata will be lost forever.\n+\n+Wallets created before version 0.13 are not HD and must be backed up every 100 keys used since the previous backup, or even more often to maintain the metadata.\n+\n+### 1.5 Restoring the Wallet From a Backup\n+\n+To restore a wallet, first a directory must be created in the `walletdir` with a name that the user wants the wallet to be named, and then copy the backup file into that directory. The copied file must be named `wallet.dat`.\n+\n+Then the user can load the wallet passing the name of the  newly created directory as parameter.",

Backing Up and Restoring The Wallet\n+\n+### 1.1 Creating the Wallet\n+\n+Since version 0.21, Bitcoin Core no longer has a default wallet.\n+Wallets can be created with the `createwallet` RPC. More information about this command may be found by running `bitcoin-cli help createwallet`.\n+\n+The following command, for example, creates a descriptor wallet:\n+\n+`$ bitcoin-cli -named createwallet wallet_name=\"wallet-01\" descriptors=true`\n+\n+The `descriptors` parameter can be omitted if the intention is to create a legacy wallet.\n+\n+For now, the default type is the legacy wallet, but that should change in the near future.\n+\n+By default, wallets are created in the `wallets` folder of the data directory, which varies by operating system, as shown below. The user can change the default by using the `-datadir` or `-walletdir` initialization parameters.\n+\n+| Operating System | Default wallet directory                                    |\n+| -----------------|:------------------------------------------------------------|\n+| Linux            | `/home/<user>/.bitcoin/wallets`                             |\n+| Windows          | `C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Roaming\\Bitcoin\\wallets`           |\n+| macOS            | `/Users/<user>/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin/wallets` |\n+\n+### 1.2 Encrypting the Wallet\n+\n+The `wallet.dat` file is not encrypted by default and is, therefore, vulnerable if an attacker gains access to the device where the wallet or the backups are stored.\n+\n+One way to mitigate this problem is to encrypt the wallet. However, this solution significantly increases the risk of losing coins due to forgotten passphrases. There is no way to recover a passphrase. This tradeoff should be well thought out by the user.\n+\n+After encrypting the wallet or changing the passphrase, a new backup needs to be created immediately. The reason is that the keypool is flushed and a new HD seed is generated after encryption. Any bitcoins received by the new seed cannot be recovered from the previous backups.\n+\n+The wallet's private key may be encrypted with the following command:\n+\n+`$ bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=\"wallet-01\" encryptwallet \"passphrase\"`\n+\n+Once encrypted, the passphrase can be changed with the `walletpassphrasechange` command.\n+\n+`$ bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=\"wallet-01\" walletpassphrasechange \"oldpassphrase\" \"newpassphrase\"`\n+\n+The argument passed to `-rpcwallet` is the name of the wallet to be encrypted.\n+\n+Only the wallet's private key is encrypted. All other wallet information, such as transactions, is still visible.\n+\n+The wallet's private key can also be encrypted in the `createwallet` command via the `passphrase` argument:\n+\n+`$ bitcoin-cli -named createwallet wallet_name=\"wallet-01\" descriptors=true passphrase=\"passphrase\"`\n+\n+Note that if the passphrase is lost, all the coins in the wallet will also be lost forever.\n+\n+### 1.3 Backing Up the Wallet\n+\n+To backup the wallet, the `backupwallet` RPC or the `Backup Wallet` GUI menu item must be used to ensure the file is in a safe state when the copy is made.\n+\n+In the RPC, the destination parameter must include the name of the file. Otherwise, the command will return an error message like \"Error: Wallet backup failed!\" for descriptor wallets. If it is a legacy wallet, it will be copied and a file will be created with the default file name `wallet.dat`.\n+\n+`$ bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=\"wallet-01\" backupwallet /home/node01/Backups/backup-01.dat`\n+\n+In the GUI, the wallet is selected in the `Wallet` drop-down list in the upper right corner. If this list is not present, the wallet can be loaded in `File` ->`Open wallet` if necessary. Then, the backup can be done in `File` -> `Backup Wallet...`.\n+\n+This backup file can be stored on one or multiple offline devices, which must be reliable enough to work in an emergency, never have connected to online devices, and be malware free. Backup files can be regularly tested to avoid problems in the future.\n+\n+If the wallet and backup are lost for any reason, the bitcoins related to this wallet will become permanently inaccessible.\n+\n+### 1.4 Backup Frequency\n+\n+The original Bitcoin Core wallet was a collection of unrelated private keys. If a non-HD wallet had received funds to an address and then was restored from a backup made before the address was generated, then any funds sent to that address would have been lost because there was no deterministic mechanism to derive the address again.\n+\n+Bitcoin Core [version 0.13](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.13.0.md) introduced HD wallets with deterministic key derivation. With HD wallets, users no longer lose funds when restoring old backups because all addresses are derived from the HD wallet seed.\n+\n+This means that a single backup is enough to recover the coins at any time. It is still recommended to make regular backups (once a week) or after a significant number of new transactions to maintain the metadata, such as labels. Metadata cannot be retrieved from a blockchain rescan, so if the backup is too old, the metadata will be lost forever.\n+\n+Wallets created before version 0.13 are not HD and must be backed up every 100 keys used since the previous backup, or even more often to maintain the metadata.\n+\n+### 1.5 Restoring the Wallet From a Backup\n+\n+To restore a wallet, first a directory must be created in the `walletdir` with a name that the user wants the wallet to be named, and then copy the backup file into that directory. The copied file must be named `wallet.dat`.\n+\n+Then the user can load the wallet passing the name of the  newly created directory as parameter.",

Backing Up and Restoring The Wallet\n+\n+### 1.1 Creating the Wallet\n+\n+Since version 0.21, Bitcoin Core no longer has a default wallet.\n+Wallets can be created with the `createwallet` RPC. More information about this command may be found by running `bitcoin-cli help createwallet`.\n+\n+The following command, for example, creates a descriptor wallet:\n+\n+`$ bitcoin-cli -named createwallet wallet_name=\"wallet-01\" descriptors=true`\n+\n+In the GUI, the `Create a new wallet` button is displayed on the main screen when there is no wallet loaded. Alternatively, there is the option `File` ->`Create wallet`.\n+\n+The `descriptors` parameter can be omitted if the intention is to create a legacy wallet.\n+\n+For now, the default type is the legacy wallet, but that should change in the near future.\n+\n+By default, wallets are created in the `wallets` folder of the data directory, which varies by operating system, as shown below. The user can change the default by using the `-datadir` or `-walletdir` initialization parameters.\n+\n+| Operating System | Default wallet directory                                    |\n+| -----------------|:------------------------------------------------------------|\n+| Linux            | `/home/<user>/.bitcoin/wallets`                             |\n+| Windows          | `C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Roaming\\Bitcoin\\wallets`           |\n+| macOS            | `/Users/<user>/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin/wallets` |\n+\n+### 1.2 Encrypting the Wallet\n+\n+The `wallet.dat` file is not encrypted by default and is, therefore, vulnerable if an attacker gains access to the device where the wallet or the backups are stored.\n+\n+One way to mitigate this problem is to encrypt the wallet. However, this solution significantly increases the risk of losing coins due to forgotten passphrases. There is no way to recover a passphrase. This tradeoff should be well thought out by the user.\n+\n+After encrypting the wallet or changing the passphrase, a new backup needs to be created immediately. The reason is that the keypool is flushed and a new HD seed is generated after encryption. Any bitcoins received by the new seed cannot be recovered from the previous backups.\n+\n+The wallet's private key may be encrypted with the following command:\n+\n+`$ bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=\"wallet-01\" encryptwallet \"passphrase\"`\n+\n+Once encrypted, the passphrase can be changed with the `walletpassphrasechange` command.\n+\n+`$ bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=\"wallet-01\" walletpassphrasechange \"oldpassphrase\" \"newpassphrase\"`\n+\n+The argument passed to `-rpcwallet` is the name of the wallet to be encrypted.\n+\n+Only the wallet's private key is encrypted. All other wallet information, such as transactions, is still visible.\n+\n+The wallet's private key can also be encrypted in the `createwallet` command via the `passphrase` argument:\n+\n+`$ bitcoin-cli -named createwallet wallet_name=\"wallet-01\" descriptors=true passphrase=\"passphrase\"`\n+\n+Note that if the passphrase is lost, all the coins in the wallet will also be lost forever.\n+\n+### 1.3 Unlocking the Wallet\n+\n+If the wallet is encrypted and the user tries any operation related to private keys, such as sending bitcoins, an error message will be displayed.\n+\n+```\n+$ bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=\"wallet-01\" sendtoaddress \"tb1qw508d6qejxtdg4y5r3zarvary0c5xw7kxpjzsx\" 0.01\n+error code: -13\n+error message:\n+Error: Please enter the wallet passphrase with walletpassphrase first.\n+```\n+\n+To unlock the wallet and allow it to run these operations, the `walletpassphrase` RPC is required.\n+\n+This command takes the passphrase and an argument called `timeout`, which specifies the time in seconds that the wallet decryption key is stored in memory. After this period expires, the user needs to execute this RPC again.\n+\n+`$ bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=\"wallet-01\" walletpassphrase \"passphrase\" 120`\n+\n+In the GUI, there is no specific menu item to unlock the wallet. When the user sends bitcoins, the passphrase will be prompted automatically.\n+\n+### 1.4 Backing Up the Wallet\n+\n+To backup the wallet, the `backupwallet` RPC or the `Backup Wallet` GUI menu item must be used to ensure the file is in a safe state when the copy is made.\n+\n+In the RPC, the destination parameter must include the name of the file. Otherwise, the command will return an error message like \"Error: Wallet backup failed!\" for descriptor wallets. If it is a legacy wallet, it will be copied and a file will be created with the default file name `wallet.dat`.\n+\n+`$ bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=\"wallet-01\" backupwallet /home/node01/Backups/backup-01.dat`\n+\n+In the GUI, the wallet is selected in the `Wallet` drop-down list in the upper right corner. If this list is not present, the wallet can be loaded in `File` ->`Open wallet` if necessary. Then, the backup can be done in `File` -> `Backup Wallet...`.\n+\n+This backup file can be stored on one or multiple offline devices, which must be reliable enough to work in an emergency, never be connected to online devices, and be malware free. Backup files can be regularly tested to avoid problems in the future.",

Backing Up and Restoring The Wallet\n+\n+### 1.1 Creating the Wallet\n+\n+Since version 0.21, Bitcoin Core no longer has a default wallet.\n+Wallets can be created with the `createwallet` RPC. More information about this command may be found by running `bitcoin-cli help createwallet`.\n+\n+The following command, for example, creates a descriptor wallet:\n+\n+`$ bitcoin-cli -named createwallet wallet_name=\"wallet-01\" descriptors=true`\n+\n+In the GUI, the `Create a new wallet` button is displayed on the main screen when there is no wallet loaded. Alternatively, there is the option `File` ->`Create wallet`.\n+\n+The `descriptors` parameter can be omitted if the intention is to create a legacy wallet.\n+\n+For now, the default type is the legacy wallet, but that should change in the near future.\n+\n+By default, wallets are created in the `wallets` folder of the data directory, which varies by operating system, as shown below. The user can change the default by using the `-datadir` or `-walletdir` initialization parameters.\n+\n+| Operating System | Default wallet directory                                    |\n+| -----------------|:------------------------------------------------------------|\n+| Linux            | `/home/<user>/.bitcoin/wallets`                             |\n+| Windows          | `C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Roaming\\Bitcoin\\wallets`           |\n+| macOS            | `/Users/<user>/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin/wallets` |\n+\n+### 1.2 Encrypting the Wallet\n+\n+The `wallet.dat` file is not encrypted by default and is, therefore, vulnerable if an attacker gains access to the device where the wallet or the backups are stored.\n+\n+One way to mitigate this problem is to encrypt the wallet. However, this solution significantly increases the risk of losing coins due to forgotten passphrases. There is no way to recover a passphrase. This tradeoff should be well thought out by the user.\n+\n+After encrypting the wallet or changing the passphrase, a new backup needs to be created immediately. The reason is that the keypool is flushed and a new HD seed is generated after encryption. Any bitcoins received by the new seed cannot be recovered from the previous backups.\n+\n+The wallet's private key may be encrypted with the following command:\n+\n+`$ bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=\"wallet-01\" encryptwallet \"passphrase\"`\n+\n+Once encrypted, the passphrase can be changed with the `walletpassphrasechange` command.\n+\n+`$ bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=\"wallet-01\" walletpassphrasechange \"oldpassphrase\" \"newpassphrase\"`\n+\n+The argument passed to `-rpcwallet` is the name of the wallet to be encrypted.\n+\n+Only the wallet's private key is encrypted. All other wallet information, such as transactions, is still visible.\n+\n+The wallet's private key can also be encrypted in the `createwallet` command via the `passphrase` argument:\n+\n+`$ bitcoin-cli -named createwallet wallet_name=\"wallet-01\" descriptors=true passphrase=\"passphrase\"`\n+\n+Note that if the passphrase is lost, all the coins in the wallet will also be lost forever.\n+\n+### 1.3 Unlocking the Wallet\n+\n+If the wallet is encrypted and the user tries any operation related to private keys, such as sending bitcoins, an error message will be displayed.\n+\n+```\n+$ bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=\"wallet-01\" sendtoaddress \"tb1qw508d6qejxtdg4y5r3zarvary0c5xw7kxpjzsx\" 0.01\n+error code: -13\n+error message:\n+Error: Please enter the wallet passphrase with walletpassphrase first.\n+```\n+\n+To unlock the wallet and allow it to run these operations, the `walletpassphrase` RPC is required.\n+\n+This command takes the passphrase and an argument called `timeout`, which specifies the time in seconds that the wallet decryption key is stored in memory. After this period expires, the user needs to execute this RPC again.\n+\n+`$ bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=\"wallet-01\" walletpassphrase \"passphrase\" 120`\n+\n+In the GUI, there is no specific menu item to unlock the wallet. When the user sends bitcoins, the passphrase will be prompted automatically.\n+\n+### 1.4 Backing Up the Wallet\n+\n+To backup the wallet, the `backupwallet` RPC or the `Backup Wallet` GUI menu item must be used to ensure the file is in a safe state when the copy is made.\n+\n+In the RPC, the destination parameter must include the name of the file. Otherwise, the command will return an error message like \"Error: Wallet backup failed!\" for descriptor wallets. If it is a legacy wallet, it will be copied and a file will be created with the default file name `wallet.dat`.\n+\n+`$ bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=\"wallet-01\" backupwallet /home/node01/Backups/backup-01.dat`\n+\n+In the GUI, the wallet is selected in the `Wallet` drop-down list in the upper right corner. If this list is not present, the wallet can be loaded in `File` ->`Open wallet` if necessary. Then, the backup can be done in `File` -> `Backup Wallet...`.\n+\n+This backup file can be stored on one or multiple offline devices, which must be reliable enough to work in an emergency, never be connected to online devices, and be malware free. Backup files can be regularly tested to avoid problems in the future.",

However, this solution significantly increases the risk of losing coins due to forgotten passphrases. There is no way to recover a passphrase. This tradeoff should be well thought out by the user.\n+\n+After encrypting the wallet or changing the passphrase, a new backup needs to be created immediately. The reason is that the keypool is flushed and a new HD seed is generated after encryption. Any bitcoins received by the new seed cannot be recovered from the previous backups.\n+\n+The wallet's private key may be encrypted with the following command:\n+\n+`$ bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=\"wallet-01\" encryptwallet \"passphrase\"`\n+\n+Once encrypted, the passphrase can be changed with the `walletpassphrasechange` command.\n+\n+`$ bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=\"wallet-01\" walletpassphrasechange \"oldpassphrase\" \"newpassphrase\"`\n+\n+The argument passed to `-rpcwallet` is the name of the wallet to be encrypted.\n+\n+Only the wallet's private key is encrypted. All other wallet information, such as transactions, is still visible.\n+\n+The wallet's private key can also be encrypted in the `createwallet` command via the `passphrase` argument:\n+\n+`$ bitcoin-cli -named createwallet wallet_name=\"wallet-01\" descriptors=true passphrase=\"passphrase\"`\n+\n+Note that if the passphrase is lost, all the coins in the wallet will also be lost forever.\n+\n+### 1.3 Unlocking the Wallet\n+\n+If the wallet is encrypted and the user tries any operation related to private keys, such as sending bitcoins, an error message will be displayed.\n+\n+```\n+$ bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=\"wallet-01\" sendtoaddress \"tb1qw508d6qejxtdg4y5r3zarvary0c5xw7kxpjzsx\" 0.01\n+error code: -13\n+error message:\n+Error: Please enter the wallet passphrase with walletpassphrase first.\n+```\n+\n+To unlock the wallet and allow it to run these operations, the `walletpassphrase` RPC is required.\n+\n+This command takes the passphrase and an argument called `timeout`, which specifies the time in seconds that the wallet decryption key is stored in memory. After this period expires, the user needs to execute this RPC again.\n+\n+`$ bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=\"wallet-01\" walletpassphrase \"passphrase\" 120`\n+\n+In the GUI, there is no specific menu item to unlock the wallet. When the user sends bitcoins, the passphrase will be prompted automatically.\n+\n+### 1.4 Backing Up the Wallet\n+\n+To backup the wallet, the `backupwallet` RPC or the `Backup Wallet` GUI menu item must be used to ensure the file is in a safe state when the copy is made.\n+\n+In the RPC, the destination parameter must include the name of the file. Otherwise, the command will return an error message like \"Error: Wallet backup failed!\" for descriptor wallets. If it is a legacy wallet, it will be copied and a file will be created with the default file name `wallet.dat`.\n+\n+`$ bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=\"wallet-01\" backupwallet /home/node01/Backups/backup-01.dat`\n+\n+In the GUI, the wallet is selected in the `Wallet` drop-down list in the upper right corner. If this list is not present, the wallet can be loaded in `File` ->`Open wallet` if necessary. Then, the backup can be done in `File` -> `Backup Wallet...`.\n+\n+This backup file can be stored on one or multiple offline devices, which must be reliable enough to work in an emergency, never be connected to online devices, and be malware free. Backup files can be regularly tested to avoid problems in the future.",
