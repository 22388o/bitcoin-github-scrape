jonasschnelli,2016-04-25T14:06:51Z,Nice! Also though about this. Thanks.\n\nutACK 1f3b3fd48bb6c5787893529862430bd77b2c7fb3\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7939#issuecomment-214346660,214346660,
laanwj,2016-04-25T15:14:27Z,Another thing to consider here now may be to add some information to the window title. After all if there are multiple open it may be useful to distinguish them in taskbars etc.\n\nI'm not sure on what to add though; transaction id seems to be of limited usefulness. Maybe date/recipient/amount.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7939#issuecomment-214387378,214387378,

laanwj,2016-04-25T15:21:43Z,"Numbering doesn't seem more useful to me than just keeping them with the same window title.

jonasschnelli,2016-04-25T15:23:43Z,What about the shortened transaction id (middle truncated). Something like `4d8fad...8dd9f9` for `4d8fad408da55d4b54e3be97960db06d78489f5984e0a6e8ada082295e8dd9f9`?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7939#issuecomment-214391453,214391453,
