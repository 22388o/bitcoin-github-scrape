Diapolo,2014-05-02T12:50:26Z,@laanwj @sipa Now using **func** instead of a static function name.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3602#issuecomment-42027675,42027675,

laanwj,2014-04-22T10:22:38Z,"Please use `__func__` instead, it is standard (as of C++11) and has been in all c++ compilers for a while. `__PRETTY_FUNCTION__` is g++ only.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3602#discussion_r11846016,11846016,src/net.cpp

laanwj,2014-04-30T13:59:47Z,BTW: Any specific reason for using `__func__` and `%s` in some places but keeping the hardcoded function name in others (like here)? It looks a bit inconsistent.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3602#discussion_r12144341,12144341,src/net.cpp
Diapolo,2014-04-30T14:03:22Z,"No, It's just the fact that `catch (std::exception &e)` mostly uses **func** etc. and I left it that way,\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3602#discussion_r12144516,12144516,src/net.cpp
sipa,2014-04-30T14:04:04Z,I'd suggest changing it everywhere you can.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3602#discussion_r12144546,12144546,src/net.cpp
laanwj,2014-05-01T06:57:12Z,Agree with @sipa here. Using `__func__` instead of duplicating the function name means that the log messages cannot diverge if the name of the function changes. So it would be good to use it in all cases. But let's at least be consistent within a function \n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3602#discussion_r12180317,12180317,src/net.cpp
