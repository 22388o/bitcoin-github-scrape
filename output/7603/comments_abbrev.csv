The names are already set in the top Makefile as @BITCOIN_QT_BIN@ and @BITCOIN_WIN_INSTALLER@, we just need to modify BITCOIN_QT_BIN to not include a path. I'll work up a quick change for that.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7603#issuecomment-204066596,204066596,

JeremyRand,2016-04-06T11:23:42Z,"@theuni Hmm, in the use cases for changing these variables that I personally deal with (i.e. Namecoin) it's pretty much a given that when PACKAGE_TARNAME is changed, the binary filenames are going to change accordingly as well.  Is there a use case I'm not seeing, where it's likely that PACKAGE_TARNAME and the prefix of the binary filenames will be different?

laanwj,2016-04-06T14:12:34Z,"Well the idea would be to keep as much flexibility as possible, so to be able to configure various names separately from each other.\nI understand that you ideally want to keep your patch as small as possible, but if changing the executable names is at least centralized in one place that doesn't blow it up much.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7603#issuecomment-206390654,206390654,
JeremyRand,2016-04-06T22:27:29Z,"@laanwj Yes, agreed that flexibility is important here.  However, is there a loss in flexibility if a forked project has to change ""$PACKAGE_TARNAME"" to something else in the four binary name variables, rather than changing ""bitcoin"" to something else in the same variables?  I'm definitely not arguing that those four variables should be removed, I just think it makes sense for their default values",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7603#issuecomment-206596260,206596260,
MarcoFalke,2016-04-07T15:52:29Z,"The loss in flexibility appears when someone changes PACKAGE_TARNAME and is surprised all the binaries changed their name, too. So, has to go back and adjust the names of the binaries...\n\nI think 644e6de8f3e8a86022a2daa4666bb28dcd5a4e24 is an uncontroversial improvement (after squash), which can be merged right now.
