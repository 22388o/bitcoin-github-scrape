fanquake,2017-08-29T12:29:47Z,Agree with @MeshCollider that the typo fix isn't correct.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11190#issuecomment-325648622,325648622,
practicalswift,2017-08-29T13:20:45Z,@MeshCollider @fanquake Thanks for reviewing! Typo fix removed :-)  What about the remaining import fix? ACK? :-),https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11190#issuecomment-325661348,325661348,

jnewbery,2017-09-01T15:52:12Z,"There are many instances in the test/functional/test_framework directory of unused imports, wildcard imports, names being imported indirectly through wildcard imports, imports on the same line, imports not in PEP8 ordering, imports not being sorted, etc.\n\nI'd rather have a single PR that fixes all of those nits, rather than tackle it file-by-file.\n\nThat said, utACK c7e0abe1904bac179771985c",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11190#issuecomment-326616602,326616602,
MarcoFalke,2017-09-01T16:28:11Z,"Agree with @jnewbery if a fix is reasonable to do for the whole project in a single commit, that should be preferred. However, if that is not feasible for whatever reason or not worth it, nothing should be touched. (Unless you need to change the line anyway.)",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11190#issuecomment-326625108,326625108,
