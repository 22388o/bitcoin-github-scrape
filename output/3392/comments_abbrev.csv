Diapolo,2014-01-10T16:00:07Z,Should we still allow (because of license stuff) to show about Qt and also our own about (which contains OpenSSL license info)? Also the manu bar to exit the program would be nice perhaps.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3392#issuecomment-32039300,32039300,
laanwj,2014-01-10T16:07:42Z,The About options and Exit should still be available in the menu? Or did the rebase remove those?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3392#issuecomment-32040008,32040008,
