Diapolo,2012-06-27T16:09:58Z,I still dislike the parameter description.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1396#issuecomment-6607718,6607718,
rebroad,2012-06-27T21:15:42Z,@Diapolo what do you suggest for the parameter description? I changed it to that as per @luke-jr's suggestion.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1396#issuecomment-6615675,6615675,
Diapolo,2012-06-27T21:46:00Z,"I think the parameter name should somehow match the description, so I propose `Shrink debug.log file on client startup (default: 1 when no -debug)`, which uses a similar wording like -discover in the brackets. If you don't like that just keep it, I guess there are more important problems to discuss ;).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1396#issuecomment-6616439,6616439,

rebroad,2012-05-31T01:30:22Z,That would certainly make it closer to the previous behavior Happy to change this unless anyone objects.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1396#discussion_r904991,904991,src/init.cpp

Diapolo,2012-06-12T20:44:29Z,I'm not sure if that is a nice string and understandable by users ...\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1396#discussion_r971024,971024,src/init.cpp

Diapolo,2012-06-15T04:58:35Z,"Perhaps `Keep debug.log file size below 10MB (default: opposite of -debug)`.\nI just think ""small"" is too general.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1396#discussion_r990927,990927,src/init.cpp
rebroad,2012-06-15T08:23:43Z,"I think 10MB is too specific. Perhaps instead of a flag on whether to shrink or not, perhaps a flag on what size to shrink at (with zero meaning never shrink)?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1396#discussion_r991411,991411,src/init.cpp
Diapolo,2012-06-15T09:35:22Z,"So more like -maxdebuglogsize, which can be set to 0 (not limited) or or to a certain value that sets the limit, when reached, debug.log gets shrunken. I like this idea, if you would keep a default value > 0.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1396#discussion_r991697,991697,src/init.cpp
