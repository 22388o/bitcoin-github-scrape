Do you happen to know which core developers that would be appropriate reviewers for this work (on a deeper `GUARDED_BY(\u2026)` level for each module)?\r\n\r\nThe types of errors I might need some help from reviewers to avoid:\r\n* False positives: Too restrictive lock requirements. Requiring a lock where a lock is not needed. More concretely: unnecessary `GUARDED_BY(\u2026)` annotations. (The `EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED(\u2026)` annotations follow more or less mechanically for the `GUARDED_BY(\u2026)`.)\r\n* False negatives: Missing lock requirements. Not requiring a lock where a lock is needed. More concretely: missing `GUARDED_BY(\u2026)` annotations.\r\n\r\nAnd perhaps most importantly: help reviewing that the *added* locks in this PR looks reasonable. In constrast to the annotations they alter run-time behaviour.\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of `AssertLockHeld(\u2026)`:s that I've been unable to map to variables being guarded. I might need some help to track those down to add the corresponding `GUARDED_BY(\u2026)`:s (and hence `EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED(\u2026)`). I'm a bit hesitant to just add `EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED(\u2026)` to match the `AssertLockHeld(\u2026)` (which would be trivial) since that methodology hides the fact that the guard required hasn't been explicitly stated using an `GUARDED_BY(\u2026)` annotation yet.",
