  "body": "Add additional Clang thread safety analysis annotations as discussed with @sipa (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10866#issuecomment-316238630) and others.\r\n\r\nThis is a follow-up to #10866 ~~which this PR is rebased upon (awaiting merge of #10866). The first three commits (8a1dc09, e022990 and cbae151) can be reviewed in #10866.~~\r\n\r\nThis PR contains three types of changes:\r\n1. Add missing locks (based on the `GUARDED_BY(...)` analysis below). Please review thoroughly.\r\n2. Add `GUARDED_BY(...)` annotations to allow for Clang's thread safety analysis at compile-time. Does not change run-time behaviour.\r\n3. Add `EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED(...)` annotations to allow for Clang's thread safety analysis at compile-time. Does not change run-time behaviour.\r\n\r\nBackground reading: The [\"C/C++ Thread Safety Analysis\"](https://research.google.com/pubs/archive/42958.pdf) paper (Hutchins, Ballman & Sutherland, 2014) paper describing Clang thread safety analysis and how it is used for the Google C++ codebase:\r\n\r\n> They essentially provide a static type system for threads, and can detect potential race conditions and deadlocks. This paper describes Clang Thread Safety Analysis, a tool which uses annotations to declare and enforce thread safety policies in C and C++ programs.\r\n> [\u2026]\r\n> It has been deployed on a large scale at Google; all C++ code at Google is now compiled with thread safety analysis enabled by default.\r\n> [\u2026]\r\n> The `GUARDED_BY` attribute declares that a thread must lock `mu` before it can read or write to `balance`, thus ensuring that the increment and decrement operations are atomic. Similarly, `REQUIRES` declares that the calling thread must lock mu before calling `withdrawImpl`. Because the caller is assumed to have locked `mu,` it is safe to modify `balance` within the body of the method.",
