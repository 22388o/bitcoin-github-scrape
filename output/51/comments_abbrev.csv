gavinandresen,2011-01-31T13:28:23Z,Nice!  I'd like to make this part of a set of changes for the 0.3.21 release to deal with sub-bitcent amounts consistently across all the RPC methods and in the GUI.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/51#issuecomment-724712,724712,
davout,2011-01-31T14:28:29Z,Would it be possible to pull it in for 0.3.20 ?\nI'd really like that in order to keep the double balance check that occurs on BC before any transfer.\n\nAlso is there a way to manually fiddle with account balances other than moving bitcoins around until achievement of desired accounts statuses ?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/51#issuecomment-724848,724848,
