Reason it was written this way is that findBlock call is slow (it requires reading and deserializing the block from disk). With this change, reorgs during findBlock will go undetected so this can wind up scanning a block that's been reorged out, or choosing a  stale next block after a reorg and failing where it could have succeeded. \r\n\r\nMaybe all of this matters less after #16426. After #16426, cs_main isn't held in this function so reorgs can happen any time, not just during findBlock. But it still seems more reliable to wait for the next block to actually be needed before looking it up, instead of looking it up early before a slow operation where it could get out of date and cause unnecessary failures.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Fixed references to #16426 (not #15719)",

In that case, the wallet could miss transactions in the later blocks due to the [`IsFromMe`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/2af56d6d5c387c3208d3d5aae8d428a3d610446f/src/wallet/wallet.cpp#L956) check in `AddToWalletIfInvolvingMe`.
