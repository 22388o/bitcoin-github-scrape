jonasschnelli,2015-06-09T11:55:02Z,"@Alex-van-der-Peet: your contribution are very welcome! Thanks.\n\nThis PR would make things more convenient, but, i have a strong feeling that the `bitcoin.conf` file should stay readonly.

The idea would be not to generate a `bitcoin.conf`  - there are good reasons to keep config files read-only - but a special 'cookie' file for authentication.

Alex-van-der-Peet,2015-06-09T13:35:47Z,"@paveljanik Eh? That is how it is implented though. No file -> create file, file -> do nothing.\n\nAlso, I might be having a moment of stupidity, but a read-only config file? How would that work exactly?\n\nI checked the access rights of the created file in Ubuntu, I think they're correct.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6258#issuecomment-110359077,110359077,
