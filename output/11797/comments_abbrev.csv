laanwj,2017-11-30T11:54:52Z,"Thanks for the contribution, but I think we can't merge this. One longer-term goal is to remove the dependency of the core library on ENABLE_WALLET - see #7965 .\n\nWorking around that is going to be a mess. What I'd suggest is to just add ""if the wallet is enabled"" to that help message.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11797#issuecomment-348167499,348167499,
