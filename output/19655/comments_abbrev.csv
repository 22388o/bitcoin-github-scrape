luke-jr,2020-08-11 21:19:43,I think technically -1 is correct?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19655#issuecomment-672285302,672285302,
adaminsky,2020-08-11 22:13:44,The -1 is from a `CHECK_NONFATAL` so the error says an internal bug is detected. I was thinking that the -8 error is more helpful since it is consistent with the result when `target_confirmations = 0`.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19655#issuecomment-672312663,672312663,
luke-jr,2020-08-11 22:18:33,But `target_confirmations` 0 is in fact an invalid parameter. A too-large height just doesn't yield a useful result *yet*.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19655#issuecomment-672318801,672318801,
adaminsky,2020-08-11 22:57:22,"Yeah, so I guess the problem mentioned in the issue has been fixed by returning a -1 error. Maybe giving the genesis block hash when `target_confirmations` is too large makes sense. ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19655#issuecomment-672338095,672338095,
adaminsky,2020-08-12 16:38:17,@ryanofsky thank you for the review. My commit message is actually incorrect because the problem with the 0 hash was already fixed from when it was reported by returning the -1 error. I'll update this to return genesis block hash instead.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19655#issuecomment-672984261,672984261,

If you think it should be mentioned both places, maybe put the inserted text after ""e.g. 1 would mean the best block hash"" instead of before to avoid jumpin",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19655#discussion_r469529413,469529413,src/wallet/rpcwallet.cpp
