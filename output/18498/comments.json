    "body": "Thanks for the feeback. Below I'll try to summarize the different aspects as I (correctly or not) see them.\r\n\r\n#### Full connections by default instead of partial connections\r\n\r\n`add_p2p_connection` was added in March 2017 with 5e5725cc2b5, which means that for the past 3 years the functional test suite using this method was running without forcing full p2p connections (which were made by calling `sync_with_ping`). If I understand correctly, the motivation for fa9064704524a0fd1fa9ea73e was to hopefully reduce spurious test failures in the CI. Nevertheless, ISTM we would ideally prefer to avoid `sync_with_ping` everywhere by default and could verify regularly if it can be reverted without increasing the number of false test negatives.\r\n\r\n#### Allowing the previous default of partial connections\r\n\r\nIt seems we still need a way for tests to make partial connections. One reason is speed/performance: *Waste not;* gains may appear minor, but the functional suite will continue growing and its run time continue to increase, long-term discouraging people from running it and increasing our dependance on centralized third parties. A more immediately interesting reason is, are there tests that might now be false positives, because their partial connection was changed to a full one to reduce false negatives?\r\n\r\n#### Downside of allowing partial connections\r\n\r\nFor 3 years, connections were partial by default and required an additional `sync_with_ping` to become full. Now, connections are full by default and would only require an additional argument be partial. The complexity is roughly equivalent with only the default state changed, but inevitably we need to be able to test various kinds of connections.\r\n\r\nIn the worst case, a test that was using a partial connection might be modified to not longer need it without the author and reviewers noticing (if the changed test required a full connection, it would fail and be noticed/updated). In that worse case, the connection would function the way the functional test suite did for the previous 3 years. Only if the new test fails would it become an issue needing to be addressed (and the fix is trivial).\r\n\r\n#### Implementation of connection types\r\n\r\nI like @robot-visions' suggestion combining the states into one argument. Yes, I looked for cases where a partial connection is a better test or more practical e.g. followed by a sync already. There are likely more of them.",
