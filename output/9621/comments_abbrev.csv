JeremyRubin,2017-01-24T05:21:51Z,"Concept ACK. Having quantities like this defined centrally would be a boon for some of the things that I have worked on.\n\nI have a latent PR that defines code similar to this for a few other related quantities (but not specifically min_tx_size). I could push up just the constants commit if desired. However, I determined that these are more appropriately placed in validation.h than consensus.h ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9621#issuecomment-274712748,274712748,

TheBlueMatt,2017-01-24T23:19:09Z,"This is technically incorrect...someone relaying you a valid-to-deserialize and valid-work block which contained a 10-byte transaction would get banned, despite the BIP pretty clearly indicating they should be allowed to do so.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9621#discussion_r97676069,97676069,src/blockencodings.cpp
luke-jr,2017-01-25T05:56:24Z,Hmm. So compact blocks effectively force a specific deserialisation implementation into a consensus-critical status?
