It was hard to use, hardly used, and probably contributed to a false sense of security as the RPC interface is not hardened against untrusted users.\n\nThe release notes in 0.12 give a few alternatives: https://bitcoin.org/en/release/v0.12.0#rpc-ssl-support-dropped",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17747#issuecomment-565776814,565776814,
