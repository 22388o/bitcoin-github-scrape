instagibbs,2019-03-26T16:16:54Z,@jnewbery do we have a place to self-test python serialization/utility code? I've added this before to other tests. I can drop it here for now.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15664#issuecomment-476726917,476726917,
jnewbery,2019-03-26T16:24:40Z,"> do we have a place to self-test python serialization/utility code?\n\nWe don't. I don't think it's worth it to be honest. The python code is pretty simple.\n\nIf we did add it, I'd suggest adding it to `/test/functional/test_framework/` and using Python's [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) module. But again, I don't think it's worthwhile.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15664#issuecomment-476730359,476730359,

stevenroose,2019-03-26T14:24:47Z,You're apparently not supposed to use `getnewaddress` (a wallet call) in `mining_basic.py` because it is run even in builds where wallet is disabled.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15664#discussion_r269129443,269129443,test/functional/mining_basic.py
