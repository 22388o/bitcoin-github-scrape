TheBlueMatt,2011-08-02T14:58:28Z,"Re: it fails: yes it is supposed to, that is a bug that should be fixed (see #443 for a potential solution).\nRe: uint160, yea I tried to figure out why, but I cant seem to see why, maybe someone else can figure that out...In any case thats a fairly minor UI issue and isnt a regression.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/442#issuecomment-1709722,1709722,
sipa,2011-08-02T15:09:19Z,"I didn't mean to comment on the failure itself, only on the reporting thereof. It's a minor issue, but maybe it means the boost test framework isn't being used correctly.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/442#issuecomment-1709845,1709845,
TheBlueMatt,2011-08-02T15:57:35Z,"OK, updated with better naming...\nNot really anything that can be done within boost test to make the output more specific, so just name the AUTO_TEST_CASE well and use BOOST_CHECK_MESSAGE instead of BOOST_CHECK\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/442#issuecomment-1710227,1710227,
