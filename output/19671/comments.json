    "body": "I don't see any problem in removing this.  But the release note asserts that this functionality was added for the purpose of replacing transactions that didn't have RBF.   Rather, the functionality was added to help rescue wallets that had been messed up by malleability attack:  https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3659#issuecomment-34878999\r\n\r\nIt's my (non-researched) belief that the malleability motivation is no longer a reason to keep the functionality, because although wallets with non-segwit coins are still malleability-vulnerable, I believe other changes mean that conflicted transactions can just be abandoned.  If there is another rash of malleability attacks, users will have to be advised to use abandon on the unsuccessful mutants rather than be advised to zap as was the case when these attacks were an issue, along with spendzeroconfchange=false (or a narrower version that only avoids vulnerable inputs, if one is ever implemented).\r\n ",
