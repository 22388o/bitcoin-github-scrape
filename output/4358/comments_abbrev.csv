theuni,2014-06-17T21:07:09Z,"ACK, exactly what I had in mind.\n\nOnce we get some logs of this happening, might be worth checking to see why we're seeing this in the first place. Could be that we should be checking acceptor status before canceling?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4358#issuecomment-46365382,46365382,

laanwj,2014-06-18T13:28:15Z,"@theuni One reason I can think of would be that we're pushing acceptors to the list that have never been activated at all. For example if it couldn't listen on a port due to lack of IPv6 support etc.\nOr maybe they've been closed for another reason, but I can't think of one. Some kind of race condition.\n\nboost::asio is frustrating.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4358#issuecomment-46434892,46434892,
laanwj,2014-06-19T06:22:07Z,"I added a commit that I believe fixes the underlying issue: acceptors were added to the list even when listening failed. I suppose in that case, cancelling them generates an error.\nI'll still keep the first commit as exceptions during shutdown shouldn't disrupt the shutdown process.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4358#issuecomment-46527276,46527276,
