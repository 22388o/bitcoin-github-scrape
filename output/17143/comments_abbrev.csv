The original font that was used in most other places (like bitcoincore.org) is ""Helvetica Neue"" (which is not available everywhere).\nUsing ""Arial"" is probably the best substitute (not ""Arial Black"").\n\nI guess this also not fixes #16836.\nSee: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/16836#issuecomment-530961972\n\nI th",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17143#issuecomment-542191723,542191723,
