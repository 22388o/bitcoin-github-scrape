sipa,2014-04-25T14:44:33Z,"Some benchmarks:\n- operator/ is up to 10 times slower than the CBigNum version (10us vs 0.8us at -O2; 4us at -O3).\n- operator\* seems significantly faster (0.08us vs 0.5us), probably due to avoiding allocation overhead.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4076#issuecomment-41400268,41400268,

gmaxwell,2014-04-26T08:39:34Z,"ACK.  (reviewed the code, tested a mainnet and a testnet resync, and added some errors and checked that they were caught— I do note that triggering divide by zero in— say— block validation results in the exception being caught which surprised me momentarily).   \n\nThe division can be made another 10% faster by using CLZ instead of the inner loop, but further optimizations do not need to happen no",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4076#issuecomment-41463413,41463413,
