jonasschnelli,2015-08-27T07:01:40Z,Concept ACK.\nNot sure if `GetAdjustedTime()` as param is required. After this PR there would be 5 more calls to `GetAdjustedTime()` (which is maybe not very time critical but at least it locks `cs_nTimeOffset`).\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6591#issuecomment-135316109,135316109,
jtimon,2015-08-29T21:30:02Z,"@jonasschnelli `GetAdjustedTime()` is not welcomed in libconsensus. Maybe @theuni can give more details about why. A vague explanation would be that libconsensus has to be stateless.\nIn main.cpp (full of global variables anyway) it's just fine, but these functions will be eventually moved to consensus.cpp to be built independently for libconsensus (or at least that's my plan).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6591#issuecomment-136054291,136054291,
