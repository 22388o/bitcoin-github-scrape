      "message": "Update brew instructions to build Boost from HEAD\n\nPreviously, when trying to build master or v0.9.0, compilation on OS X\nwould fail [1]. This commit resolves these errors by building Boost from\nsource. Building from HEAD removes the guarantee of a repeatable build,\nbut this appears to be a necessity until the next version of Boost is\nreleased.\n\nAt the time of this writing, the current version of Boost is 1.55.0 [2].\nPresumably, the next release will include the changes now on HEAD, and\nonce that new version has been made available in Homebrew [3], this\ncommit should be reverted.\n\n[1]: https://gist.github.com/9704573\n[2]: http://www.boost.org/users/history\n[3]: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/commits/master/Library/Formula/boost.rb",
