    "body": "Please read the entire description. This is in no way a step backwards. Split yml files are a goal of yours that I have never shared. The package cache negates the need entirely. It will only rebuild the parts that are necessary. If a dep is changed, that dep gets rebuilt (and any anything that depends on it). That is superior to split yml's in every way.\n\nGitian is a mechanism for regulating the build environment. Using its descriptors as build recipes has always been fundamentally broken.\n\nLike it or not, we have to build the dependencies for releases. For that, some sort of package manager must be used. Until now, it was a hacked together set of scripts with no continuity. Don't pretend that it wasn't a package manager, it was just a really poor one. So it's a false argument to say \"we don't need a package manager\". Now, it's a coherent system. And since it's a coherent system, it makes sense to share it with other things that care about dependencies.\n\nDecoupling from the main repo would be senseless and self-defeating. In-repo, code in all branches is tied to the process it's built with, as it should be. There's no synchronization to worry about, or outside forces to break it. Automated systems can rely on this process. We'll know right away from the pull-tester if a new feature is incompatible with our release libs, just as we'll know that our released binaries will be functionally identical to what comes out of the pull-tester, just with the non-deterministic bits stripped out.\n\nThis fixes lots of real problems in a cohesive and maintainable way. I'm very willing to discuss substantive criticisms, but please be sure to attach actual arguments to them.\n",

Unified deps are useful for building bitcoin for dev (as @sipa probably just tested), for c-i, for release processes, etc. It's tightly tied to Bitcoin Core because it was designed to fit Bitcoin Core's needs - it sacrifices build-speed for determinism, and targets our release goals in terms of static/shared dependencies.\n\nSharing it outside of Core is uninteresting to me because it's designed to solve Core problems. Other projects could always fork the dir and patch to meet their requirements, but you can bet that they would choose to integrate it into their repositories because that's what makes sense. If there are direct benefits _for us_ having this out-of-repo, please list them.\n",

    "body": "@luke-jr To your points\n- If anything, this makes modularization easier. For example, with this in place, we could use libsecp256k1 and leveldb much more easily as external libraries, because we could be sure of how they were built for release. Same goes for new modules as we continue to break them out.\n- This does not increase anyone's burden. The Core build-system remains exactly as-is, this just replaces the way we build our binaries. To repeat myself: we already had a system for this in place, it's just been upgraded.\n- See above.\n- I don't see how Bitcoin Core could possibly have a goal of helping others build deterministic binaries. That's 100% beyond our scope. If that's your goal, contribute to the upstream tools that break determinism. I've already done this for binutils where it was needed. If there are other tools that need fixes, I encourage you to help fix them.\n\n@sipa That's a reasonable suggestion, but it breaks features with (seemingly) no gain. When in-repo, all branches, tags, and commits will have their dependencies and build-process tied to them. This is a huge benefit as it allows for pull-tester to verify them in real-time and for gitian to reproduce them. If out-of-repo, there'd be a constant synchronization game to deal with.\n\nFor the sake of discussion, if you're going to advocate moving this stuff out of core, please elaborate on what the actual benefits of that would be. Otherwise, I just can't see how the proper response isn't \"meh, just ignore the folder\".\n",

Deterministic binaries is outside the scope of Bitcoin Core in general, which is to be a full node and wallet implementation.

    "body": "@luke-jr In the case of projects that are happy to rely on a given build environment, say the standard packages of a known linux distribution then you would just accept the VM state. In a project that does not trust the dependencies except those which it compiles itself, you recreate your deps. It doesn't sound like you have much experience of CI in the real world. It's very common to have multiple CI projects interacting, each project has it's own CI process, various super projects are triggered when child projects trigger.\n\nCI is simply the automation of everything you would and should do to test your code quality all the way through to the final build. Often those tasks are so onerous and time-consuming, so us humans do them only occasionally. Building and compiling the gitian sources packages is one of those tasks. So in CI you must replicate all the step, which include fetching the sources, compiling them and building the build environment. And you **shouldn't care**, since the process is automated, unless you are worried about carbon footprint, which frankly is a joke compared to the Bitcoin network's carbon footprint ;)\n\nI don't understand your argument, nor why you would complain about such a monumental leap in progress for Bitcoin. This project has been **crying out** for decent CI. It will make everyone's life better so in the end, we can spend more time coding and testing features than struggling. With full CI it becomes possible to download the binaries for every single patch made - now anyone, including normal users can test out new GUI features etc (remember the whole watch wallets PR? think how many more people could have participated in the testing if we had proper CI running then?).\n\nFinally, CI means that when Wladamir pushes an RC, the only thing we need to do here to sign it off is compare out gitian builds. If we have a CI system anyone can replicate, verifying builds are in fact as they should be (hashes match) will be a trivial exercise.\n",

You've now confirmed that you've neither read the description nor the readme, and that you drew your conclusions based on the file structure alone. As I said earlier, I'm happy to have a spirited debate about the merits or implementation of the work. But I'm not going to argue your preconceived notions, there's nothing to be gained by that. Please just don't be so vocal about them, it only serves to derail the discussion.\n\nIf you'd like to give it a go, check it out, hit a 'make' in the depends dir, and wait a while. You'll notice that all builds are now cached in the 'built' folder. Hit make again, and nothing is rebuilt. Now bump a dependency's revision and 'make', and it'll be rebuilt alone (along with anything that depends on it).\n\nTravis understands how to use this cache, once our account is setup correctly. Jenkins could too, or whatever ci is desired. I pasted a link in the summary to the PR that teaches gitian to understand it as well. With this implementation, at any given time, a full Gitian build boils down to a single command that completes in 3-4 min.\n",

I hooked up ccache as well, so the actual 'make' is down to a few seconds.\n- As suggested by @sipa, the comparison tool is fetched as a dependency for now.\n- Also suggested by @sipa, build revisions have been eliminated in favor of hashing the package recipes and patches themselves.\n- Build on OSX works.\n\nAll that remains now is a quick fix for OSX packaging, then onto cleanup and documentation.\n",

In the above example, a dir named i686-w64-mingw32 will be created. To use it for Bitcoin: \n> \n>  ./configure --prefix=`pwd`/depends/i686-w64-mingw32\n\nI'm not sure that using '--prefix' for this is  the right way here. Prefix is the install prefix of bitcoin itself, which is not necessarily the same as the temporary prefix of the dependencies.\n",

    "body": "The --prefix thing is an autoconf trick, and I'm afraid there's probably no avoiding it (if you want the convenience of it, anyway). When --prefix is used, it checks $prefix/share/config.site for data that can be used to seed configure. One slightly possible alternative is using a config.cache instead, but I think that would be quite a bit of trouble.\n\nThe cost of not using the --prefix trick is having to manually specify all of the variables needed (host, toolchain, boost, qt, protoc, flags, etc). Personally I don't think using --prefix is too bad, since end-user builders are unlikely to ever build this way, so running the binaries from the srcroot is the most likely outcome (if not building with a pull-tester or gitian anyway).\n",

I added some docs in depends, please fire away with additional questions and I'll add answers there.\n\nPulling this in won't change anything, as Travis and Gitian are not yet hooked up. Once merged, I'm hoping to have Travis setup and running along-side the current pull-tester a few days later. After that, I'll PR the overhauled gitian descriptors that take advantage of the dependencies builder.\n",
