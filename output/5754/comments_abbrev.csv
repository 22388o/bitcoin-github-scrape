laanwj,2015-02-04T15:44:28Z,"You have it the wrong way around: getblocktemplate did have a wallet lock before #5711 (every RPC call got both the wallet lock and the main lock), but it now no longer takes it, so it also doesn't need to release it.\nGood catch anyway, ACK.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5754#issuecomment-72877723,72877723,

laanwj,2015-02-04T16:04:32Z,"Hmm - The problem in  getblocktemplate_proposals.py indeed seems to be unrelated to #5711. Bitcoin thinks it is in initial block download, and refuses to execute getblocktemplate.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5754#issuecomment-72881716,72881716,
laanwj,2015-02-04T16:16:11Z,"Verified that the problem with proposals exists at least as far back as 631e698, so I'm going to go ahead and merge this - that problem will have to be solved separately.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5754#issuecomment-72884077,72884077,
