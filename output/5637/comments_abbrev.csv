jonasschnelli,2015-01-12T09:31:46Z,some spaced after if nits but i assume we discussed that... but i was looking forward to once 'nit' you. :)\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5637#discussion_r22780550,22780550,src/qt/bitcoinamountfield.cpp
Diapolo,2015-01-12T09:35:30Z,"Haha :), got me. Well the only reason I did not add a space was because the surrounding if clauses also have the wrong style ^^.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5637#discussion_r22780656,22780656,src/qt/bitcoinamountfield.cpp
Diapolo,2015-01-13T10:54:08Z,"@jonasschnelli As I picked up a small suggestion, I also fixed your nit ^^. Can you Re-ACK this now?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5637#discussion_r22854954,22854954,src/qt/bitcoinamountfield.cpp
