Code that is conditionally or externally included rots.\n\nIdeally we should be building libsecp256k1 every time we build bitcoin.  Thus, Makefile would always exist.\n\nThen, one could use bitcoin Makefile configury to select which library and glue gets linked at link time.\n",

    "body": "I would agree with that, and would be fine doing it that way. My main concern is initial teething pains. After merge, there are bound to be small build bugs in libsecp that cause build failures. I'd hate to see bitcoin fail to build because of an unwanted library's failure. But on the flip-side, that's the quickest way to flesh out those bugs and get them fixed, so I wouldn't complain either way.\n",
