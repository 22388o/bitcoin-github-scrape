    "body": "thanks jgarzik for taking your time to explain this issue, i do not fully agree here but will not continue with probably already answered questions. A \"committer guide\" will be nice though to maintain some order and less troubles for the main devel :)\n\nI'm not experienced with git so i will be redoing all the forking and committing stuff to fully comply, doing your work harder was not my intention.\n",
