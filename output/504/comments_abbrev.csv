jgarzik,2011-09-11T03:12:28Z,"The commit deletes *.mo, which is not the desired effect.\n\nYour commit needs to simply modify *.po, and touch nothing else.\n\nThanks.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/504#issuecomment-2062313,2062313,
paraipan,2011-09-11T11:54:16Z,"yeah, that would be my goal in every commit but with this one i had some troubles cause the editor overwrites the *.mo at the same time when you save the translation. I didn't know it was this difficult for you guys to manage submitted work from other people, i will try not to bother again.

jgarzik,2011-09-11T18:53:51Z,"It becomes difficult for the very few engineers with pull requests, if each pull request requires manual modification after it is submitted.\n\nIt is -normal- in an open source project to request the submittor update their pull request in response to feedback.  See the Linux kernel, or Apache, or Eclipse, or any number of other open source projects for similar feedback-response-update workflow.\n\",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/504#issuecomment-2065140,2065140,
paraipan,2011-09-11T19:59:05Z,"thanks jgarzik for taking your time to explain this issue, i do not fully agree here but will not continue with probably already answered questions. A ""committer guide"" will be nice though to maintain some order and less troubles for the main devel :)\n\nI'm not experienced with git so i will be redoing all the forking and committing stuff to fully comply, doing your work harder was not my intenti",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/504#issuecomment-2065450,2065450,
