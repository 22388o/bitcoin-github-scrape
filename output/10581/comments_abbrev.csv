morcos,2017-06-27T17:57:13Z,"posthumous utACK\n\n@sipa, I'd misinterpreted this https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10559#issuecomment-307276253 to imply you wanted ViewMempool functions to include whether the mempool contains a spend.  But now I think you didn't want that and are happy with where we are now?  If so, so am I.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10581#issuecomment-311436432,311436432,

ryanofsky,2017-06-22T16:12:19Z,What's the point of the two InsecureRandBits calls skipping the new BOOST_CHECKs? It seems like the checks should always pass and aren't very expensive. Is the point to avoid creating cache entries during the test? Maybe add a comment saying why this only randomly checks HaveCoin results.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10581#discussion_r123555279,123555279,src/test/coins_tests.cpp
