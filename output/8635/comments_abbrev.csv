instagibbs,2016-09-12T17:50:04Z,"Looks like you snagged a couple commits from another PR in here. That intentional?\n\nFollowing this logic, any follow-up softfork from Core codebase would assume previous softforks will be followed then?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8635#issuecomment-246432019,246432019,
jl2012,2016-09-12T18:14:19Z,"@instagibbs I just rebased on top of that PR. It was not merged at that time. Should I rebase again?\n\nThis one is special. Since segwit is a completely new tx format, there is no excuse for not respecting any known softforks, which have been enforced for months.\n\nFollowing this logic, it should have been mandatory for version 2 transactions to follow all existing softforks (expect segwit), sin",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8635#issuecomment-246439740,246439740,
