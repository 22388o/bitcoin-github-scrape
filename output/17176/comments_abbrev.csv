MarcoFalke,2019-10-17 15:40:19,">  I'm not sure what the specific goals of #13728 were\n\nI assumed it was a low-risk change that would provide us with some experience of macOS on travis (to help go forward with #16597). It also had several ACKs https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13728#issuecomment-520917697, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13728#pullrequestreview-274735332",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17176#issuecomment-543234900,543234900,
MarcoFalke,2019-10-17 16:56:14,"Also, now that #16597 is merged, we should be more cautious with using too much travis resources. On weekdays a backlog of macOS builds up here: https://www.traviscistatus.com/",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17176#issuecomment-543267002,543267002,

It's still the case that people will run Mac OS environments.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17176#issuecomment-543285256,543285256,
MarcoFalke,2019-10-17 18:24:54,"There is a backlog of about 400 jobs on macOS travis right now (see the link in my previous comment). I don't think it is worth it to use those resources for linters, when mac users can simply not run the linters (they are run on travis as the fist step, real quick) or install GNU sed via brew or run them in a bionic docker container.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17176#issuecomment-543301977,543301977,
