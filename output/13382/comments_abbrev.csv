Empact,2018-08-11T23:10:10Z,"I guess I'm more wondering: what is the justification for it? If it doesn't help with significant performance optimizations (ala `move`) and we don't expect it to affect the error performance of the method (because we don't expect it to throw) then why should we apply the treatment? If we should apply it here, should we apply it to most methods? Just a notion.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13382#issuecomment-412307457,412307457,
