    "body": "@sipa I tend to disagree pretty strongly. I know you prefer primitives/* to be very dumb-data-storage objects, but since CTransaction is const, it would be quite a waste to not use that to store any precomputed thing we can in it. @sdaftuar had a previous version of this patch that made CTransactionRef a wrapper around a shared_ptr to the CTransaction as well as the precomputed data, but that, too, goes in primitives and ended up just being more complication for no reason.\r\n\r\nAnyway, we're already halfway between \"dumb storage\" and \"precalculated\" anyway, since we precalculate the hash and store that. The distinction of not precalculating the witness hashes seems arbitrary to me.",

I ran into some issues with that approach that might also make it objectionable, but maybe there are ways to better solve those problems that would make it workable.\r\n\r\n@dcousens Regarding the performance gain: I've been running some benchmarks on my workstation, and over the last 100 blocks, it looks like this speeds up validation by about 7%.",
