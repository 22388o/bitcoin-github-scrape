jonasschnelli,2015-10-15T06:41:14Z,Agree with @fanquake: 0.11x release notes make not much sense in the 0.10 branch.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6831#issuecomment-148296290,148296290,
laanwj,2015-10-15T10:46:30Z,"Agreed, let's not do this (in the worst case this creates N \* N pull requests/commits...) Most important is that the master branch has the historical release notes so people can find them through the github interface. Apart from that maybe the most recent release branch.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6831#issuecomment-148349206,148349206,
