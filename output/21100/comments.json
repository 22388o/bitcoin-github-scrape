    "body": "@fanquake: Thanks for pointing out. `verify_ecdsa` is indeed unused, but was in the dead-code linters whitelist since its introduction (removed recently in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16961/commits/f4beb4996d27f2cdaf4f0a63e7dc044bf17decce), so I guess the community's wish is to keep it (to have a complete Python ECDSA implementation)? Force-pushed now with the change of replacing `sign_pubkey` with an underscore.",
