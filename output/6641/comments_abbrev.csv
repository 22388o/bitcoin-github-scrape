I don't see any significant usability issues with allowing this right away since SPV clients will just look for more nodes if they get disconnected(the percentage,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6641#issuecomment-156392682,156392682,
jonasschnelli,2015-11-25T09:27:09Z,"Concept ACK.\nAlthough there is one problem: `Misbehaving(pfrom->GetId(), 100)` results in a ban,  `fDisconnect=true` allows a node to reconnect. My tests have shown that SPV clients tend to directly reconnect, call filter commands, get disconnected, a.s.o. Which happens in connect/disconnect loops multiple times per second.\nNot sure what is best here, maybe it's reasonable to ban the node for se",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6641#issuecomment-159546686,159546686,

TheBlueMatt,2015-11-26T02:18:21Z,"@jonasschnelli I think fDisconnect is the only reasonable behavior we can do (unless we implement a temporary ban, but that wouldnt add much given that either way it results in disconnect after only one or two roundtrips). We certainly cant completely ban given that we really want the ""wait, why is my node not syncing? Oh, there's an update to my software"" flow to work.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6641#issuecomment-159783823,159783823,
