It does not (IIRC) reverse -I order.\r\nIn the example that I give in the OP, `primitives/block.h` includes `\"primitives/transaction.h\"`, it will look in `src/primitives/primitives`, failing that it goes down the entire -I chain, to finally try in `src/`.\r\nSo that would find `/usr/include/primitives/transaction.h` first.\r\n\r\nDuplicated include files can lead to more confusion with relative includes as it  can be ambiguous which one is included. At least with `-I` you can just follow the include path when figuring out the issue.\r\n\r\n> Much more likely if there was an ordering bug though, would be a compilation failure. A subdir would at least save us from those. Would it make sense to use -I$(top_builddir) and #include <src/amount.h> as a precaution?\r\n\r\nI think on the longer run we should make sure all source files are in directories under `src/`, not `src` itself. Many bigger open source projects seem to have this convention.\r\n\r\nI really dislike using top_builddir as an intermediate step though. It'd work, but feels dirty to add `src/` before each include. I'd rather just close this.\r\n\r\nRegarding active paranoia, someone could still put a `src/amount.h` in your include path and it will take precedence.\r\n\r\nOnly insanely disciplined relative inclusion (using explicit `./` and `../`) could avoid that \"attack\", I think. That's... crazy though :( In any case if your include path is compromised, there are lots of other ways to create harm.",

Or are there other problems?\r\n\r\nMy earlier scripted diff ([branch](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/commits/pr/inc)) is neutral with respect to the issue theuni is talking about because it leaves includes that are relative to the source directory intact, and only modifies includes that rely on the include path from <> to \"\". So for example, if an amount.h were added to an prepended include path, nothing different would happen than already happens now.\r\n\r\nMore broadly though, it is hard to imagine taking this issue seriously, because the project already uses a mix of <> and \"\" includes, and all of the existing <> includes (as well as nearly all the \"\" includes in subdirectories below src/) are already relying on the configured include paths. And as laanwj pointed out this change is only removing include paths, not adding any, so it is strictly decreasing whatever ambiguities there may be in interpreting #include directives compared to what we are doing now.",

I don't see any way out of that, he's right and we're already screwed, and this doesn't make it better (though it does make things more consistent, if they mess up! I have to stand by that. You won't have file A including the right copy and file B including the wrong one, for instance.).\r\n\r\n> So for example, if an amount.h were added to an prepended include path, nothing different would happen than already happens now.\r\n\r\nI did think about that, and that would be true if we weren't using subdirectories ourselves. However as soon as we `#include \"amount.h\"` in one of the subdirectories of `src`, the same thing happens! This is what I mean with \"insanely disciplined relative inclusion\" two posts back. `#include \"../amount.h\"` would be unambiguous (if you do this consistently, I guess you could even remove `-I` completely for the project itself).\r\n",

    "body": "Thanks! Just to give my opinion, I think any of the following changes would be simple and minimally disruptive improvements on the status quo:\r\n\r\n1) A change using `-Isrc` and `#include<full_path>` everywhere that would make the build slightly more vulnerable to theuni's issues than we already are, but would make it more obvious what file is being included in the normal case where you don't have a messed up build configuration. This is implemented in the current PR.\r\n\r\n2) A change dropping `-Isrc` and using `#include \"../rel_path\"` everywhere that would prevent the issues raised by theuni in present and future code. This should not be hard to implement with a variation of laanwj's scripted diff.\r\n\r\n3) A change that would not alter current behavior at all, but just improve readability by replacing current hodgepodge of `#include \"rel_path\"` and `#include \"full_path\"` with `#include \"rel_path\"` and `#include <full_path>`, to make it clear when the include path is supposed to be interpreted as a relative path, and when it's supposed to be interpreted as a full path. My [pr/inc](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/commits/pr/inc) branch basically does this already but it would need a tweak to handle bitcoin-config.h.\r\n\r\nSlight preference for (1) over (2) over (3), but I think any of these could be good improvements and there may be other simple solutions as well (like using `-iquote` or `-I-`). \r\n\r\nIf more disruptive changes are ok, it'd also be nice to move headers in the src/ root to appropriate subdirectories. But I think that type of change would be better to handle separately and should not block simple improvements like the one implemented in this PR.",
