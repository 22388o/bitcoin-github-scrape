practicalswift,2017-11-15T15:13:49Z,@luke-jr Thanks for reviewing. Closing this PR. I'll probably create a new PR with a subset of the `getblocktemplate` changes. More precisely I'll let the `cs_main` remain as-is but add additional locking where required for `chainActive`.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11691#issuecomment-344622963,344622963,
