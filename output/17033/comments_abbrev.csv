laanwj,2019-10-03 03:00:12,"I disagree with this, hardening should never be automatically disabled. Things such as stack cookies do not interfere with debugging at all, and if they do that's a bug that needs to be solved, it should be the default to debug as closely to the original code as possible. \n\nIf this particular hardening feature really interferes with debugging then disable that, not all hardening features.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17033#issuecomment-537764138,537764138,
achow101,2019-10-03 16:16:55,I've changed this to just disable `_FORTIFY_SOURCE` when `--enable-debug`. It appears that it doesn't do anything with optimization level 0 (as we do for `--enable-debug`) except print that warning.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17033#issuecomment-538016342,538016342,
