(Even if its just a tiny amount and right now basically never happens?)\r\n\r\nAs for this PR: Yes, I agree that 1 WU (and 1 SigOp cost) is totally neglectible, I more opened it for idealistic reasons, as I think the behaviour was not intended by the author and could readers lead to the conclusion that the maximum values are meant to be exclusive.",
