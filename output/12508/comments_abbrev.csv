kallewoof,2018-04-09T00:41:30Z,"So, the new `IsAllFromMe` code does not check if `GetDebit(ISMINE_ALL) > 0`, which `IsMine` does. The result is that the existing code will say 'not eligible' and the new code will say 'eligible', for many of the coin selector test cases. I think adding a check for `GetDebit` to `IsAllFromMe` is the right approach, but I believe @morcos removed this part for a reason in #9167.\n\nPing @morcos.

If a random person checks a coinbase transaction, I think it will claim it is theirs now.
