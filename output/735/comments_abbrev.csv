sipa,2012-01-04T12:46:13Z,"Forgot to mention: because name lookups happen using the unified getaddrinfo() call, a #define _WIN32_WINNT 0x501 was necessary, which means WIndows XP or later.

jgarzik,2012-01-06T16:03:33Z,"overall ACK\n\nMinor quibble, maybe ignore-able:  The connection logic in CService feels like it belongs in a separate class.  CService and CNetAddr seem more focused on address and/or endpoint datum, whereas the connect() logic seems more in the socket realm.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/735#issuecomment-3386369,3386369,
