Empact,2018-09-19T13:50:40Z,Main argument for this is that it is protective against another constructor being added but neglecting to initialize these vars properly.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14266#issuecomment-422811421,422811421,

sipa,2018-12-13T17:49:20Z,@MarcoFalke I expect that this will have no effect on performance (the default initializers being invoked instead of delegating to the default constructor should do the exact same thing).\n\nutACK,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14266#issuecomment-447059460,447059460,
