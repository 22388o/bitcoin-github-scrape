I know several use cases where you have many `wallet.dat` files and with this, you can remove all the notes around the files you have to select between them.\n\nI can even imagine removing/deprecating `encryptwallet`, `walletpassphrasechange` and such from `bitcoind` afterwards.\n\nWe have to take care of proper file locking when",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8745#issuecomment-247756809,247756809,

This does the CDB::rewrite step as done after encryption, but is meant to get rid of no-longer-used 'junk' blocks in the wallet.
