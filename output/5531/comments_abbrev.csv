Diapolo,2014-12-23T13:40:23Z,"Just asking, what happens when not using it during build of libsecp256k1? Are you using own routines for doing what libgmp was used for?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5531#issuecomment-67951538,67951538,
sipa,2014-12-23T13:45:31Z,"@Diapolo indeed. GMP can be used for getting a faster modular inverse implementation, or for implementing field arithmetic (operations modulo p = 2^256 - 2^32 - 977), while there are other implementations for both too.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5531#issuecomment-67951944,67951944,

laanwj,2014-12-23T14:15:46Z,"@diapolo yes, and note that libgmp is not used for any routines that version 0.10 actually uses from secp256k1 (ie, signing), so it was a useless dependency\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5531#issuecomment-67954572,67954572,
