laanwj,2015-06-01T08:07:51Z,Original code seems fine to me too. No strong opinion for or against this.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6207#issuecomment-107352787,107352787,
luke-jr,2015-06-02T04:35:09Z,Seems like it'd be cleaner to just add a CNodeStats to CNode.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6207#issuecomment-107799618,107799618,
laanwj,2015-06-02T07:06:53Z,"@luke-jr That indeed sounds like a very clean solution. If indeed every field is copied, I don't see any immediate drawbacks.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6207#issuecomment-107833476,107833476,

Diapolo,2015-06-06T09:55:46Z,"I guess the proposed change could also requires some changes in rpcconsole and peertablemodel? Perhaps another dev takes a look at it, if we want to hurry... otherwise I'm going to look into this after the weekend.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6207#issuecomment-109561243,109561243,

jgarzik,2015-06-07T02:39:34Z,meh.  Code goes from clean to less clean.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6207#issuecomment-109677150,109677150,
Diapolo,2015-06-08T06:47:18Z,"I was asked to do so, but perhaps I did it the wrong way? We need to wait for @laanwj @luke-jr and @sipa to see their comments.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6207#issuecomment-109881643,109881643,
sipa,2015-06-08T10:06:58Z,"Not what I meant.\n\nI meant removing the CNode values that are also in CNodeStats from CNode, and replacing them with a nodestats field. GetStats would then just return a copy of the nodestats field.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6207#issuecomment-109940288,109940288,
Diapolo,2015-06-08T11:51:55Z,"@sipa Well, `nodestats` is just the name of the CNodeStats attribute that you wanted me to add to the CNode class, right? So mine is currently named just `stats`. Only thing that differs is that I guess you wanted me to remove or rework `CNode::copyStats()` so that it returns a CNodeStats copy. Is this correct?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6207#issuecomment-109963340,109963340,
sipa,2015-06-08T11:59:34Z,"I meant moving all statistics into it, include nLastSend etc. Once you do that, CopyStats can just copy the nodestats field in its entirely, rather than copying all values from within CNode.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6207#issuecomment-109965229,109965229,
Diapolo,2015-06-08T12:22:37Z,"@sipa Right, as I've written I just wanted to be sure my change goes into the right direction (that's why I only included nServices).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6207#issuecomment-109975264,109975264,
laanwj,2015-06-10T07:54:36Z,"As this trivial issue appears to be controversial, I think it's not worth spending more time on. The original code is already clear in intent.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6207#issuecomment-110641695,110641695,
