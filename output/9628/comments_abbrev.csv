morcos,2017-01-25T15:13:00Z,Could you pass an increased `wait` here or maybe better yet make sync_blocks calculate a wait based on timeout unless it's explicitly passed.   Otherwise the 1000 lines of the debug log that travis saves quickly fill up.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9628#discussion_r97798605,97798605,qa/rpc-tests/pruning.py
sdaftuar,2017-01-25T15:21:13Z,"Forgot about that, thanks -- bumped the wait to 5 seconds.  No objection to teaching sync_blocks to be smarter as well, but I'd like this merged asap to get the test suite working again.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9628#discussion_r97800640,97800640,qa/rpc-tests/pruning.py
