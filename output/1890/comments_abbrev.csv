Diapolo,2012-09-30T10:07:07Z,"Idea is a good one, what I would love to see is avoid HTML-format tags in strings we use in translations. This is not always possible, but I would split that mega string into smaller pieces and use e.g. `+ QString(""<br>"")  +` or `+ ""<br>"" +` in between.\n\nEdit: What does the `<qt>` tag do or achieve there?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1890#issuecomment-9012320,9012320,

runeksvendsen,2012-09-30T11:57:49Z,"Good point about HTML in translation strings. I've removed the tags from the strings in tr(). And also made it somewhat more readable.\n\nI'm wondering if we should include a more detailed description in the message, as previous backups don't exactly become useless as soon as the wallet is encrypted.
