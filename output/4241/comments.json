    "body": "Pushed a cleaned up and rebased version with some additional changes. On @gavinandresen's advise, I'm not going to bother breaking the move from .am's to .include's into smaller chunks for the sake of easier review. It's a pretty straightforward change.\n\nNow that we're non-recursive, things like AM_CPPFLAGS become global to all builds. I've removed our usage of those globals in favor of setting the flags per-target.\n\nAlso (mainly to help in my testing of the changes) I've silenced the qt build spew. Now, the usual `make V=1` shows the full output as would be expected.\n\nAs discussed with @laanwj yesterday: This does not address the issue in #3955, but it doesn't regress it eaither. That can be addressed as a follow-up.\n\nI've removed the RFC description as (if pull-tester is happy) I believe this is now merge-ready.\n",
