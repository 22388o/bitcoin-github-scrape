I'll close this pull request, and hope that someone submits the human-readable timestamp patch instead.\n\nAlso:  there was a privacy concern related to universal timestamps, so maybe add an option -logtimestamp, thereby defaulting the timestamps /off/ by default.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/91#issuecomment-853273,853273,
jhyslop,2011-03-10T03:29:58Z,"Actually, I plan to rework the logging slightly, so I'll add the optional timestamp when I do that. And since I'm adding a flag, there's no reason it can't be '-logtimestamp=<off | numeric | human-readable>'.\n\nWhat was the privacy concern, do you remember?\n\nMy plan is to modify OutputDebugStringF to accept two parameters, one indicating the verbosity level (off, critical error, error, warning,",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/91#issuecomment-854558,854558,
jhyslop,2011-03-13T22:02:48Z,"Jeff, I've been working on the code as mentioned. Can you elaborate on the privacy concerns? I don't really see how the timestamps in the log could be a privacy concern.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/91#issuecomment-867037,867037,

I shouldn't try to read his mind, but I THINK what he was thinking is somebody subpoena's N bitcoin services for their debug.logs to try to figure out where transactions were originating\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/91#issuecomment-867066,867066,
jhyslop,2011-03-13T23:49:31Z,"I wondered it might be something along those lines. As a side note, it would be an interesting challenge to figure out how many nodes you'd have to subpoena in order to determine with any degree of certainty the origin of a coin.\n\nMy revisions to OutputDebugStringF will, by default, NOT log anything to do with individual transactions. Basically, only infrequent status messages such as the hash r",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/91#issuecomment-867270,867270,
jgarzik,2011-03-13T23:52:29Z,"In general, incremental approaches tend to work better than grand rewrites, so I would rather test the waters with BlueMatt's patch.
