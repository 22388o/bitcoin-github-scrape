promag,2018-04-14T08:49:17Z,Also use `ShutdownRequested()`? I realize that`fRequestShutdown` is used in `src/init.cpp` (the function is also used) but I wonder if using `ShutdownRequested()` should be used instead.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12980#discussion_r181546417,181546417,src/init.cpp

promag,2018-05-03T12:08:33Z,I'll try to follow up a refactor here: this error should come from `LoadBlockIndex` and therefore the above condition is not necessary.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12980#discussion_r185775598,185775598,src/init.cpp
l2a5b1,2018-07-06T12:48:05Z,"I would find it difficult to ACK this prior to #13235, because the use of `ShutdownRequested` would create a circular dependency between `txdb` and `init.cpp` where the `ShutdownRequested` function is implemented. Rebasing onto master solves this ðŸ˜ƒ.  ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12980#discussion_r200642634,200642634,src/txdb.cpp
