practicalswift,2021-09-04 13:51:34,Strong Concept ACK,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22815#issuecomment-912977870,912977870,
laanwj,2021-08-27 14:31:45,"I don't think it's correct to assume `clang++` exists here, as well as is the compiler that is used to compile qt?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22815#discussion_r697489586,697489586,depends/packages/qt.mk
laanwj,2021-08-27 14:35:55,"Oh, I misunderstand what this does. It doesn't actually *run* the command but searches for it in expanded `$($(1)_cxx)`.\n\nIt does seem somewhat over-specific to look for `clang++ -stdlib=libc++`.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22815#discussion_r697492857,697492857,depends/packages/qt.mk
hebasto,2021-08-27 14:36:43,"I think it is not an assumption, rather an option. If `clang++` compiler with `-stdlib=libc++` flag is used to compile the `qt` package, we just choose the correct `linux-clang-libc++` mkspec.\n\nOtherwise, the `linux-g++-64` mkspec is used as usually.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22815#discussion_r697493492,697493492,depends/packages/qt.mk
hebasto,2021-08-27 14:39:43,"> It does seem somewhat over-specific to look for `clang++ -stdlib=libc++`.\n\nTrue. Because `clang++ -stdlib=libc++` requires the `linux-clang-libc++` mkspec.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22815#discussion_r697495835,697495835,depends/packages/qt.mk
laanwj,2021-08-27 19:50:32,"But what if say, the version of clang uses libc++ by default? Looking *only* at the argument (which should *directly* follow the compiler name) looks kind of fragile and will not catch every case where someone links against libc++.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22815#discussion_r697683792,697683792,depends/packages/qt.mk
hebasto,2021-08-27 20:40:50,"Fair point...\n\nHave you any suggestions?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22815#discussion_r697707709,697707709,depends/packages/qt.mk
hebasto,2021-09-28 09:06:31,Suggesting to continue this discussion in #22814 where this commit belongs to.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22815#discussion_r717377501,717377501,depends/packages/qt.mk
