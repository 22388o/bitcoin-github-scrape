fanquake,2021-09-21 04:44:06,"Not sure what you expect to be done here. Even if Github, Appveyor and DrahtBot are all wrong about there being a conflict, if this PR can't be merged using the [merge-script](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-maintainer-tools/blob/master/github-merge.py) (it currently can't), it's not going to be merged. The fact that no CI is running is also a blocker. I'd suggest rebasing on a master more",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23027#issuecomment-923619367,923619367,
