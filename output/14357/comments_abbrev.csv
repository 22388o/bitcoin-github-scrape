practicalswift,2018-10-02T09:12:39Z,"@donaloconnor Agreed! It could be that @jimpo meant to give `seek` absolute seek (`SEEK_SET`) behaviour (alternative 2 in the PR description) and the `-6` (instead of `0`) in the test is just a typo. With that solution the switch to signed integer is not needed :-)\n\nI'll await some clarification on the intention here and adjust accordingly.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14357#issuecomment-426204473,426204473,
