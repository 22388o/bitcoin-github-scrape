laanwj,2012-10-12T22:04:37Z,I just tried importing from transifex myself and get the same result. So you did nothing wrong. I still can't explain it though.\n\nEdit: seems that the message was in the translations and one of the duplicates is now removed. OK.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1922#issuecomment-9394183,9394183,

laanwj,2012-10-12T21:58:47Z,"Huh, it may be that something went wrong. For example, why is this message being removed from all languages? It's still there in `forms/addressbookpage.ui`.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1922#discussion_r1834389,1834389,src/qt/locale/bitcoin_bg.ts
Diapolo,2012-10-12T22:11:26Z,"I'm rather sure this was removed, because of the bitcoingui.cpp cleanup I did some time ago. That string was a tooltip as far as I remember. And it is still used and in the translation files for the sign/verify message dialog.\n\nEdit: Found it: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1705/files#L1L229\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1922#discussion_r1834508,1834508,src/qt/locale/bitcoin_bg.ts
