apoelstra,2012-12-27T02:17:41Z,"On Linux, you can get the analyzer to run by adding\n\nCXX=clang++ --analyze\n\nright above the ""LINK=$(CXX)"" line in makefile.unix, then do a full build. It will output its warnings as though it were a compiler (though it won't actually compile anything). I'm not familiar with the Windows build process, sorry.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2123#issuecomment-11698994,11698994,
laanwj,2013-01-05T15:55:51Z,"I've also seen these warnings by the analyzer, but I'm not so sure about removing the code. It's there to make maintenance easier (ie, will make it somewhat more robust when adding code by making sure hSOCKET will never have an invalid value, and nSize will always be up to date). Compilers are generally smart enough to remove dead code like this in the binary.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2123#issuecomment-11915547,11915547,
