jgarzik,2014-08-13T19:33:38Z,Perhaps better to follow rpcrawtransaction.cpp in this regard?  https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/rpcrawtransaction.cpp#L650\n\nWhat compiler are you building with?  I don't see any warnings.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4696#issuecomment-52098674,52098674,
laanwj,2014-08-14T08:53:55Z,ACK. Clearly the brace grouping per record was missing. Looks like a correct change to me.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4696#issuecomment-52158584,52158584,
sipa,2014-08-14T09:38:21Z,Untested ACK\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4696#issuecomment-52163261,52163261,
jgarzik,2014-08-14T12:14:10Z,"It would have been nice to have a response to my feedback, before merging.  That is the purpose of leaving feedback.  I don't ask these questions just to hear myself talk.\n\nThe code in question came from rpcrawtransaction.cpp originally.\n\nThe change as merged diverges further from rpcrawtransaction, rather than converging.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4696#issuecomment-52175569,52175569,
laanwj,2014-08-14T12:42:12Z,"@jgarzik You can still use a different way to solve this, if you think it matters. To keep the number of open pulls from getting out of hand, merging trivial and obviously correct changes quickly makes sense.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4696#issuecomment-52177963,52177963,
laanwj,2014-08-14T12:51:22Z,"You do make a good point that the code is duplicated, though. It would be better to have this mapping only in one place.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4696#issuecomment-52178822,52178822,
jgarzik,2014-08-14T13:10:54Z,"Yes, the two pieces of code perform exactly the same function, and keeping the parsing interfaces unified is better long term.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4696#issuecomment-52180737,52180737,
theuni,2014-08-14T15:16:41Z,"@jgarzik sorry for not responding before merge. Warning comes from most compilers I tried, specifically g++ 4.7 I'm using now and shows it. I didn't look into how it was being used, just fixed the aggregate initialization as the compiler pointed out.\n\nI can move findSighashFlags to a utility class somewhere, I agree that it's strange to find that implemented twice. Where would make the most sens",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4696#issuecomment-52196981,52196981,
