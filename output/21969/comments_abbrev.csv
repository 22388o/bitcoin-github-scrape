MarcoFalke,2021-05-17 11:43:58,"Not sure what you mean. This tells the compiler to select the uint8_t-serialization for the ASCII-character `N` (or `K`).\n\nNone of the ASCII characters use the ""sign""-bit, so the serialization of them is identical, regardless of whether they are serialized as `int8_t, char, unsinged char, uint8_t, or signed char`",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21969#discussion_r633458956,633458956,src/addrman.cpp

MarcoFalke,2021-05-20 07:47:05,"Is this a philosophical question?\n\nPreviously the compiler produced code to serialize the value `78` (which is 'N') by selecting the `char` serialization template.\nNow, the compiler produces code to serialize the value `78` (which is also 'N') by selecting the `uint8_t` serialization template.\n\nBoth templates map to the same code, so the binary should be identical.
