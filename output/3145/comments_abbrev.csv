Diapolo,2013-10-27T20:58:52Z,Updated:\n- re-worked some UI tooltips to better understand (secure -> verified and insecure -> unverified)\n- changed code to use SendCoinsRecipient.message for storing the memo\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3145#issuecomment-27179058,27179058,
laanwj,2013-10-28T15:08:31Z,"I've tested a bit, works great.\n\nNext thing we need to deal with is how payment request-generated transactions are shown in the transactions list.

Diapolo,2013-10-28T16:38:40Z,"Thanks for testing, I'm with you, we should rework how pr are shown in the tx list.

laanwj,2013-10-28T16:43:26Z,"Eh yes, I certainly am not proposing that you add that to this pull req, it was just a general remark :)\n(BTW as unverified payments requests don't really have a recipient name/label, just the memo, this makes it challenging to show them in the transaction list in the same way as other transactions)\n\nAnd indeed a delete button would be useful, currently the only way to get rid of payment reques",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3145#issuecomment-27229432,27229432,
Diapolo,2013-10-28T16:51:11Z,"@laanwj A further thing to consider is our baloon pop-up when a transaction is detected. I mainly use 3 addresses I sent coins to when testing a payment request. This is really ugly with the pop-up, as we only show 1 a time, but the 3 are practically created right in a row... any idea here?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3145#issuecomment-27230304,27230304,
laanwj,2013-10-28T16:56:55Z,"It should really show only one popup per transaction, not per output.\n\nFor the transaction list some kind of grouping makes sense too. Right now we always generate one record per output. Grouping on transaction level would be too coarse, but it should ideally show paid payment requests (which can involve multiple consecutive outputs) as one row and not multiple.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3145#issuecomment-27230970,27230970,

laanwj,2013-10-28T12:14:41Z,Can you be sure that the new SendCoinsRecipient is always the first one? (index 0)\nNit: It may be better to first build a SendCoinsRecipient and append it to recipients at the end of the function. This also avoids a lot of repeated `recipients[0]`.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3145#discussion_r7245794,7245794,src/qt/paymentserver.cpp
Diapolo,2013-10-28T12:24:09Z,"I locally changed all QList<SendCoinsEntry> usages with processPaymentRequest() to a single SendCoinsEntry, as we don't have multiple SendCoinsEntries with payment requests (as that is one of the things which this pull is changing), so yes I can be sure (as long as there are no subtle bugs left then).\n\nYour nit should be fixed by the next push to this branch :).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3145#discussion_r7245969,7245969,src/qt/paymentserver.cpp
