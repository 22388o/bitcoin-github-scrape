MarcoFalke,2020-11-15 17:17:17,"There are some more changes that I haven't yet pushed to increase coverage even further. They change the seed format as well, so I am going to mark this as draft for now.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20370#discussion_r523786715,523786715,src/test/fuzz/process_messages.cpp
Crypt-iQ,2020-11-22 23:31:22,"What is the procedure for when a PR needs to modify the fuzzing harness and may invalidate all of the seeds? Should something akin to a database migration be used if possible, applied to the seeds to get at least the same coverage as before?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20370#discussion_r528422682,528422682,src/test/fuzz/process_messages.cpp
MarcoFalke,2020-11-23 08:05:16,"The format might be arbitrarily complex (even depending on the consensus rules or other Bitcoin Core code), so I don't think this can be done automatically in a trivial manner. I mostly do it manually if the fuzz engine can't figure it out by itself after a bit of CPU time.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20370#discussion_r528522387,528522387,src/test/fuzz/process_messages.cpp
