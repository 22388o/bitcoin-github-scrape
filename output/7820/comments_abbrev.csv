jtimon,2016-10-14T18:07:25Z,"Rebased and fixed one error, but it is still failing.\nStill not sure what to do with AmountErrMsg and ParseAmountFromArgs. For the latter to use the former, both need to be put together in either util.o or ui_interface.o.\nI pushed an alternative simpler option without creating the policy interface nor removing the global minRelayTxFee in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/compare/master...jtimon",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7820#issuecomment-253878042,253878042,

jtimon,2016-11-04T00:12:03Z,EDIT: needed rebased and rebased https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/compare/master...jtimon:0.13-consensus-dust-out-minimal \nping @btcdrak since the two branches are kind of competing and he advised me against doing that with 2 open PRs because people tend to get confused.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7820#issuecomment-258311661,258311661,
jtimon,2016-12-05T05:45:58Z,"Apart from being failing tests and needing rebase, this is going to conflict with #9243.
