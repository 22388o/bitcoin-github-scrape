jgarzik,2015-10-29T00:40:18Z,Agree w/ @gmaxwell - we want to avoid patching leveldb\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6899#issuecomment-152041342,152041342,

mcelrath,2015-10-29T02:10:02Z,"Dunno, I wouldn't want leveldb in the core in the first place...\n\nI haven't analyzed these sign comparisons to see if they could overflow, but I find the idea pretty scary.  But I don't think this is an argument worth having.  Will backout everything except the rpcserver change.  We can remove the -Wno-self-assign when we actually switch to C++11.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6899#issuecomment-152052116,152052116,

mcelrath,2015-10-29T12:55:07Z,"FWIW, the unsigned change was all to do with the ""n"" parameter of a Bloom filter, which is its number of bits, and is nonsensical for it to be negative.  I'm sure these warnings have nothing to do with C++11 mode...\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6899#issuecomment-152171676,152171676,
