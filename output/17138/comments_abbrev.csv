ariard,2019-10-15 18:11:36,I think this error message is wrong. You can rescan in pruned mode if rescan height is in range of non-pruned blocks. It's really likely it's going to fail if wallet has been disabled for a long time but not sure. Maybe a warning?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17138#discussion_r335102028,335102028,src/wallet/init.cpp

I see the message in CreateWalletFile keeps the suggestion to use -reindex, so this looks good to me.\n\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17138#discussion_r335103029,335103029,src/wallet/init.cpp
