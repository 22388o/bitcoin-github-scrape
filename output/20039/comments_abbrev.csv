sipa,2020-09-29 18:30:40,It's a type annotation. It has no operational semantics (so execution will be identical to not having them at all). All it does is fail type checking if that's enabled.\n\nI assume OP is incorrectly assuming that it actually determines the runtime type.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20039#discussion_r496952333,496952333,test/functional/mempool_accept.py

laanwj,2020-09-30 11:26:19,"I don't think this is correct. Python never interprets inline numbers as Decimal, and the type annotation doesn't change that.

guggero,2020-10-04 10:28:38,These are the values from L170 and L188. I think we should extract those to a proper variable that is also of type `Decimal`.
