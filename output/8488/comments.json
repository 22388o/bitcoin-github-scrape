    "body": "There has been much discussion on this in the past:\n- #1653 Ability to freeze / erase private keys\n- #3314 Exposed / Compromised (must sweep) / Used / Imported (?) flags on addresses\n- #8338 Ability to hide/delete receive addressess\n- #5525 Add removeaddress RPC call (remove watch-only address)\n- #8338 Allow removing/expiring or firewalling bitcoin addresses\n\nFirst, I don't want to merge functionality that irrecoverably removes private keys. That's just too much of a foot-shooting gun, as well as is easy to use in the wrong way - people will use it to generate one-shot keys, by generating a key then removing it, but this can't provide any guarantee at all.\n\nAnd with HD wallets it makes no sense anyhow.\n\n'hiding' addresses or 'neutering' keys, however, is fine. So is forgetting watchonly keys.\n",
