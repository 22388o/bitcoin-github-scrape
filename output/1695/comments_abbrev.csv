sipa,2012-08-21T18:09:16Z,"@Diapolo Normally, block files do not contain orphan blocks (by which i mean blocks that have no known parent), they do have chains of stale chains that got reorganised away (which is what I assume you're talking about). This only prevents real orphan blocks from being imported.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1695#issuecomment-7910355,7910355,
