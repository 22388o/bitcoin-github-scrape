jonatack,2021-03-15 14:51:31,"Did more testing and bumping the timeout from the default 60 to only 120 (instead of 480) appears to be enough to resolve the issue for me locally. If the CI is green, we could start with that. Tested at each point with both 1 and 10 blocks generated and didn't see a difference in timeout behavior.
