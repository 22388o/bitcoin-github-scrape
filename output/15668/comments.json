    "body": "This is a near perfect distinguisher that lets a network observer tell wallet generated transactions from non-wallet generated transactions. E.g. if you are a spy, also connect in to anyone who connects out to you.  Then observe transactions which were announced on the outbound links but are not included in announcements on your links into them.\r\n\r\nVirtually any network behaviour that is different for wallet txn and non-wallet txn results in strong distinguishers.\r\n\r\n> The transaction is still added to the mempool, which means an active (tx-creating) attacker could find that we were the source of the transaction in some corner cases. (E.g. They can create descendant txs and trigger a mempool limit). However, it should not be possible to simply request the transaction, since it was only added to a peer specific relay map.\r\n\r\nThey don't need to do anything as elaborate as creating descendant txs, they can just INV the transaction at you to see if you're aware of it. :)",
