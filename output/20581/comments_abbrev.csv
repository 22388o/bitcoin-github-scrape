glozow,2021-01-18 23:22:45,"Er, would it be alright if I changed the `Workspace` here back to non-const? I'd interpret Workspace as an ""in-out"" parameter used throughout `MemPoolAccept::AcceptSingleTransaction`. As I understand it, this PR makes it `const` for 2 of the intermediate steps based on some code analysis, but I think it might just be coincidentally unmodified inside those functions 😅 I'd like to be able to update ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20581#discussion_r559833388,559833388,src/validation.cpp
