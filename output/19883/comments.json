    "body": "> I'm not sure if it's good idea to return enum's `int` value. If the enum is changed/refactored clients get broken. IMO string is fine and enough.\r\n\r\nIf a string was returned, changing the string name would be a breaking change, and string names are likely to be bike-shed or changed. OTOH there is no reason why the enum integer values would ever have to change. The `enum class` itself can separate the `int` values from the rest with no need for extra methods; it can remain stable even if the enum element naming or order is otherwise changed. And the integer is the easiest data for API clients to parse, bounds check and use as an index into a data structure.",

The RPC API, on the other hand, is more-or-less machine-first and constrained by stability and the desire to avoid causing suffering for software clients downstream, even if it does not for human users of the RPC like us. That is what this PR focuses on. An additional human-friendly convenience field could be an option if people feel the tradeoffs are worth it, but that's orthogonal to this proposal.\r\n\r\n> changing the string names isn't a breaking change\r\n\r\nRenaming a connection type not only entails cascading codebase changes for long-format name ids, it is also a breaking API change if the client no longer recognizes the connection type. This can be avoided by using a standard integer id decoupled from the naming. I will provide a demonstration with code a bit later.\r\n\r\n> getpeerinfo isn't a performance critical call\r\n\r\nThis field is called in a loop. API clients may be interested in performance, either because they call this frequently or at high frequency (I do) or from clients/to servers that are constrained in CPU, memory, or internet bandwidth. If it's available with a couple of lines, why dunk on it?\r\n\r\n> all the numbers are encoded as strings anyway -- it's json\r\n\r\nI could be wrong but don't think this is true. https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159\r\n\r\n> and even if none of that were true, you should be providing benchmarks\r\n\r\nRequesting benchmarks for the simplest, standard practice is a bit pedantic. No one asked for benchmarks, for instance, when in #19731 I proposed to send Unix epoch times instead of a human-friendly datetime format.\r\n\r\n> I don't know where this is coming from, but it's not even literally true: [\"id - The request id. This can be of any type.\"](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification_v1) and [\"id .. MUST contain a String, Number, or NULL value if included\"](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification)\r\n\r\nThanks for confirming that we can use numbers. Now...do you see any long-format, non-numerical string ids in https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification#examples and https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification_v1#a4.CommunicationExamples? Right, neither do I (maybe I need glasses; I have been putting it off for a long time). Sure, you *could* use ersatz long-format strings, but ideally not as your primary id. \"I want to depend on long-format names that [people are already proposing to change](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19958), please send me that\" said no API client to me ever. However, the clients might be ok with it as an optional convenience field that they can request on a per-call basis.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, thank you for having a look. Mind giving a concept ACK?",

    "body": "Concept NACK.\r\n\r\nI don't think we should be exposing internal enums, as its mapping between numbers and connection type semantics is arbitary. Exposing it via RPC is cementing it in stone, for no good reason. The set of available connection types will change over time, and that will very likely mean that some types that currently exist won't remain.\r\n\r\nAs I've pointed out https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19725#issuecomment-699265953, if you want an actual stable mapping with the advantages of machine-readability of numbers over the strings assigned by #19725, I think you'd need to maintain a separate set of numbers for the RPC interface, in which old numbers may retire if connection types are removed/split or even just substantially change meaning. I don't think that's worth the effort.\r\n\r\n",
