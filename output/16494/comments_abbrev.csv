jonasschnelli,2019-07-30 18:09:43,"Nice cleanup.\nI kinda dislike the name ""OldKey"" (I should have raised that concern in #16475 though). The term ""Old"" in software-code, is a very much dynamic and should IMO be avoided. It's unclear to the reader what ""Old"" means and what an ""old wallet"" exactly is. Ideally we would have a bit more information like since what version we stopped writing such keys, etc.\n\nutACK d7855d0a445ea0d82",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16494#issuecomment-516530959,516530959,
