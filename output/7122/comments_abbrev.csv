gmaxwell,2015-11-28T10:00:22Z,Er. This would prevent me from figuring out which of my daemons was testnet/mainnet/regtest... and still doesn't make it actually secure.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7122#issuecomment-160270817,160270817,

laanwj,2015-11-30T09:13:54Z,"This provides a false sense of security. There is a time window in which the arguments are visible, it may be possible to time this exactly, if not then the brute force 'request the process list in a tight loop' would work to get the credentials at least some of the time (once would be enough.)\n\nUnder Linux you can use the `hidepid` mount option: http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-hide-processes",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7122#issuecomment-160565733,160565733,

laanwj,2015-12-07T16:28:04Z,"I'm not talking about an interactive mode. Interactive mode is less straightforward to implement, e.g. nice prompt handling, intermediate variables, etc. It would be useful but I think it'd be better to write a different script/application for that, e.g. based on a Python (or Javascript) shell.\n\nNo, what I mean is simply to read the input (once) from stdin so a script or user using `bitcoin-cli`",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7122#issuecomment-162578480,162578480,
