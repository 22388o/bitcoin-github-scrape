theuni,2015-03-05T20:14:53Z,"Looks fine to me (assuming the merge is removed).\nIf you'd like, though, I think you should be able to just set `BOOST_TEST_RANDOM=$TRAVIS_BUILD_ID` in the global section to get the same effect.\n\nBUILD_ID should be the same for each builder on each run.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5855#issuecomment-77442458,77442458,
gavinandresen,2015-03-05T20:51:26Z,"@theuni : good idea, but it'll have to be $(( TRAVIS_BUILD_ID + 1 ))  ... because we don't want -random=1 (that means really and truly random). Can the travis variable assignments be arbitrary bash expressions?\n\nAlso: why isn't Travis building commit 6cfd49f ?  (which I added just to make sure failures actually fail)\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5855#issuecomment-77448967,77448967,

Something like `BOOST_TEST_RANDOM=1$TRAVIS_BUILD_ID` ?\n\nIt looks like Travis had some downtime earlier today, it may just still be processing its backlog.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5855#issuecomment-77453579,77453579,
