jgarzik,2014-11-05T11:51:39Z,NAK.  (1) duplicates linearize   (2) no need to build this into bitcoind at all.\n\nSee https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/master/contrib/linearize\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5217#issuecomment-61796352,61796352,
laanwj,2014-11-05T11:58:27Z,"Agreed @jgarzik \n\nYou could just have asked how we make a bootstrap.dat file? That script has existed for a while, but maybe it's underdocumented. Anyhow, on the positive side, now you gained some experience in patching bitcoind...\n\nEdit: no, the blocks are not queried using RPC in the current export script, just the block hashes are, and that's done using batched JSON-RPC so very fast\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5217#issuecomment-61797006,61797006,

Elbandi,2014-11-05T13:29:02Z,"the main reason was the speed: the old rpc based script was running many hours (~10 hours, 600k blocks) on [Diamon](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=580725) altcoin. With in-wallet export, this need <20 minutes. If this new python script are same fast, that's good. :)\n\nThe second reason, is more complex: many altcoin are based on your codebase. they may have multihashing algo or new field",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5217#issuecomment-61806440,61806440,
jgarzik,2014-11-05T13:39:05Z,"@Diapolo It duplicates existing scripts, adding complexity where none is needed.  The current trend is to move code _out_ of bitcoind, not the other way around.\n\n@Elbandi  If alt-coins refuse to upgrade their codebase, the maintenance cost is on them, not us.  Our linearize script is sufficiently fast.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5217#issuecomment-61807665,61807665,

laanwj,2014-11-05T13:54:34Z,"@Diapolo Running a bare Python script on Windows is not ugly at all. We had lots of Python code at my last employer, running on Windows as well. It gets ugly when you need dependencies such as PyQt, but that's not the case here, the script has no dependencies beyond the base library.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5217#issuecomment-61809635,61809635,
laanwj,2014-11-05T14:02:34Z,"Note that the bootstrap file has become a lot less important now that headers-first synchronization has been implemented, so there's no use to have two ways to do it.\n\nIf this makes sense for altcoins, then apply it to altcoins. For us it doesn't, so I'm closing this.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5217#issuecomment-61810664,61810664,
