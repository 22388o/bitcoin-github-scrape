Those changes have gone through half a dozen iterations, but never been merged because they're constantly moving in and out of PRs. Now you've tacked it on to something else that will need more review, essentially putting the brakes on it again. Worse yet, it fails to build.\n\nPlease, just wait for one chunk at a time.

    "body": "I'm sorry, I just wanted to show that this (and everything necessary to expose VerifyHeader) is independent from #5696, from whether MANDATORY_SCRIPT_VERIFY_FLAGS is consensus, policy, or none of them. And if the includes in #5696 (not so many now that the policy stuff is left out) trigger a rebase (like they have done many times before), this could still not need rebase and have an older commit ID the replacement of https://github.com/jtimon/bitcoin/commit/691161d419fe3d82d7a49b511ef80e2b24332aac.\nI also wanted to show additional motivation for  #5975 (or maybe merge both together, it's not that big of a change), for example, to support the argument for merging #5975 before #6055.\n\nAbout the building error, I don't know why forgetting .h files in the makefile doesn't fail in my computer, but fixed.\n\nAnyway, even if it's independent from #5696, merging one would trigger a trivial rebase on the other, so closing until #5696 and #5975.\n",
