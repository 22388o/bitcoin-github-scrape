jonasschnelli,2015-06-21T10:45:13Z,@Diapolo: right. UniValue has some json_spirit compatibility functions which should be removed/changed (but not in this PR). Also some functions should be renamed `IsNull()` vs `get_str()` looks after a json_spirit compatibility relict.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6316#issuecomment-113884299,113884299,
