For instance: (off the top of my head) bind uses it. The entirety of the priv escalation code in the kernel (setuid binary processing, etc) uses it. The bounding set feature that lets you set a mask of capabilities that can be re-enabled is fairly new but the underlying mechanisms have been in place since 2.4 iirc.\n\nAnd to answer you sgimenez this code isn't just removing all capabilities. It's setting the _capabilities bounding set_ so that _nothing spawned from the bitcoin process can ever re-enable them_. See the referenced documentation in the original pull.\n",
