However, the line was in there way before that. \nSome deeper git forensics shows that the first commit in which the printf redefinition was in `src/rpc.cpp` was 84c3fb0. This appears to be _also_ a reorganization commit, in which `/rpc.cpp` was renamed to `src/rpc.cpp`.\nDigging even deeper, 22f721d was really the first commit in which it was introduced (by Satoshi himself).\n\nLooks like it was added for \"MSVC 8 compatibility\".\n\nFYI, the git command to grep a while throughout all commits:\n\n```\n git grep OutputDebugStringF $(git log --pretty=format:%h) -- rpc.cpp\n```\n",
