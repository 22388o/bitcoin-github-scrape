We include util.h quite often and it's mostly before boost headers...\n\n@laanwj It was your pull, perha",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1977#issuecomment-10049209,10049209,
laanwj,2012-11-04T11:03:06Z,"That line is actually ancient.\n\nIt's showing up the text as being from me because I renamed `src/rpc.cpp` to `src/bitcoinrpc.cpp`. However, the line was in there way before that. \nSome deeper git forensics shows that the first commit in which the printf redefinition was in `src/rpc.cpp` was 84c3fb0. This appears to be _also_ a reorganization commit, in which `/rpc.cpp` was renamed to `src/rpc.c",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1977#issuecomment-10049324,10049324,

After all, as you say, all the rpc*.cpp spinoffs work fine without it.\n\nThough my real preference would still be to remove the re-definition of printf, rename OutputDebugStringF to some sane name such as debug_log(), and use that throughout the source code. But I don't think everyone agrees.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1977#issuecomment-10049397,10049397,
