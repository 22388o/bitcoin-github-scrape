JeremyRubin,2017-03-30T17:38:32Z,"200 seems a bit small, and I'd imagine if we get a big error we don't expect we'd want to see it all? Maybe a slightly better way to do it is to filter on message type -- can you detect things that are big that we don't really want, e.g. messgae.startswith('bigmsgstartswith')?\n\nalso I prefer doing repr(message)[:200] than format string hacking as I always have to re-read format string rules to",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10124#discussion_r108989588,108989588,test/functional/test_framework/mininode.py

At the moment, a test like pruning.py , which sends hundreds of full blocks, will result in a log file that is GBs in size.\n\nI can't think of a way to detect things that we don't want. A tx message could be up to 1MB, so should we filter them all out? How about block messages?
