Even absent seeding, eventually it should learn something via the four that are up or via feelers.\n\nThe alternative I considered to the connect-to-relevant commit was adding something to periodi",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8949#issuecomment-254371609,254371609,

(Or even running a re-seed every 24 hours)?\n\nIncreasing load on the DNS seeds, as well as privacy  - when the DNS seed gets a request every time it still knows you're running a node. For these reasons the number of requests to DNS seeds is minimized (see also #4559). There is an option to force querying them though.\",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8949#issuecomment-254736142,254736142,
