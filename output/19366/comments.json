I guess the linker doesn't go looking for unresolved symbols with no main?\r\n[14:11] <sipa> cfields: hmm, what symbols are missing?\r\n[14:12] <cfields> sipa: zmq/miniupnpc/etc.\r\n[14:12] <sipa> oh\r\n[14:12] <sipa> that sounds fixable?\r\n[14:12] <cfields> We could tack them on, but that kinda sucks.\r\n[14:13] <cfields> Yeah, there's another approach though to avoid linking altogether though, 1 sec.\r\n[14:13] <sipa> or maybe it's just not an issue\r\n[14:13] <sipa> because if it's not a problem for real fuzzing, why would it here?\r\n[14:13] <sipa> perhaps it's due to not having main() indeed\r\n[14:17] <cfields> different approach: https://github.com/theuni/bitcoin/commit/d36b2b9cfe7d3916f261e88b63c03a7a3edd9ea5\r\n[14:17] <cfields> That one's verbose though, requires us to c/p the object names to that list.\r\n[14:20] <sipa> that's somewhat annoying (it's already annoying to need to add a blob to the makefile for every new fuzz test)\r\n[14:20] <sipa> but not terrible i guess\r\n[14:24] <cfields> I'll play with the linker errors a bit, see if there's a quick fix.\r\n[14:49] <wumpus> even just compiling and not linking would find the largest part of the errors introduced by changes and drift i guess\r\n[14:50] <wumpus> link-time errors are kind of rare",

Hopefully writing fuzz tests to show a basic level of robustness for new code will soon be almost as natural as writing unit or functional tests for new code :)  Building the fuzzers by default will hopefully help us get there even sooner.",
