I'm not really declining this, my point was only that \"reviewable straightforward code\" is important from a security perspective and this sometimes trumps pure performance (depending on the part of the code). Especially in a memory-unsafe language like C++ where it's so easy to reach outside a buffer. We've had some discussions about this in the past when Base58 seemed to attract a lot of pretty arbitrary \"make it faster\" changes. At least you're doing proper benchmarking.",
