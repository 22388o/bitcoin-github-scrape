MarcoFalke,2018-08-22T20:34:09Z,"Yeah, submitblock had zero test coverage previously, which is why this was missed during review I guess.\n\nPersonally I don't care about the specificness of the return code for invalid blocks (since in normal operation you'd never submit invalid blocks), but we might want to backport this if some miner cares.\n\nCC @TheBlueMatt @luke-jr ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13983#issuecomment-415170202,415170202,

MarcoFalke,2018-09-14T18:50:55Z,"@ryanofsky I believe the changes here only affect the return value of invalid blocks. I'd be surprised to see someone submitting invalid blocks in production. Also, I believe this restores the behavior that existed before 0.17.0.\n\nIf someone feels strongly they could backport that to 0.17.0, but at this point it might be too late to get in.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13983#issuecomment-421451604,421451604,
