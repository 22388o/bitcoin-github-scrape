Sjors,2021-09-29 09:14:05,"External signers can in principle be used without wallet support, though currently only the `enumeratesigners` RPC call works (not very useful). See `rpc_signer.py`. This is consistent with RPC calls like `signrawtransactionwithkey` which also don't need a wallet. This is why I initially picked the Node interface. Not sure how much this matters, or even if anyone cares about using external signers",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23004#issuecomment-929995625,929995625,
