This fixes a buffer overflow in\n+the XML parser during initial network discovery.\n+\n+Details can be found here: http://talosintel.com/reports/TALOS-2015-0035/\n+\n+This applies to the distributed executables only, not when building from source or\n+using distribution provided packages.\n+\n+Additionally, upnp has been disabled by default. This may result in a lower\n+number of reachable nodes on IPv4, however this prevents future libupnpc\n+vulnerabilities from being a structural risk to the network\n+(see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6795).\n+\n+Test for LowS signatures before relaying\n+-----------------------------------------\n+\n+Make the node require the canonical 'low-s' encoding for ECDSA signatures when\n+relaying or mining.  This removes a nuisance malleability vector.\n+\n+Consensus behavior is unchanged.\n+\n+If widely deployed this change would eliminate the last remaining known vector\n+for nuisance malleability on SIGHASH_ALL P2PKH transactions. On the down-side\n+it will block most transactions made by sufficiently out of date software.\n+\n+Unlike the other avenues to change txids on transactions this\n+one was randomly violated by all deployed bitcoin software prior to\n+its discovery. So, while other malleability vectors where made\n+non-standard as soon as they were discovered, this one has remained\n+permitted. Even BIP62 did not propose applying this rule to\n+old version transactions, but conforming implementations have become\n+much more common since BIP62 was initially written.\n+\n+Bitcoin Core has produced compatible signatures since a28fb70e in\n+September 2013, but this didn't make it into a release until 0.9\n+in March 2014; Bitcoinj has done so for a similar span of time.\n+Bitcoinjs and electrum have been more recently updated.\n+\n+This does not replace the need for BIP62 or similar, as miners can\n+still cooperate to break transactions.  Nor does it replace the\n+need for wallet software to handle malleability sanely[1]. This\n+only eliminates the cheap and irritating DOS attack.\n+\n+[1] On the Malleability of Bitcoin Transactions\n+Marcin Andrychowicz, Stefan Dziembowski, Daniel Malinowski, \u0141ukasz Mazurek\n+http://fc15.ifca.ai/preproceedings/bitcoin/paper_9.pdf\n+\n+Minimum relay fee default increase\n+-----------------------------------\n+\n+The default for the `-minrelaytxfee` setting has been increased from `0.00001`\n+to `0.00005`.\n+\n+This is necessitated by the current transaction flooding, causing\n+outrageous memory usage on nodes due to the mempool ballooning. This is a\n+temporary measure, bridging the time until a dynamic method for determining\n+this fee is merged (which will be in 0.12).\n+\n+(see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6793, as well as the 0.11.0\n+release notes, in which this value was suggested)\n+\n+0.10.3 Change log\n+=================\n+\n+Detailed release notes follow.

There\n+are also a few bug fixes and updated translations. Upgrading to this release is\n+recommended.\n+\n+Please report bugs using the issue tracker at github:\n+\n+  https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues\n+\n+How to Upgrade\n+===============\n+\n+If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely\n+shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the\n+installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on Mac) or\n+bitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux).\n+\n+Notable changes\n+================\n+\n+Mining and relay policy enhancements\n+------------------------------------\n+\n+Bitcoin Core's block templates are now for version 3 blocks only, and any mining\n+software relying on its `getblocktemplate` must be updated in parallel to use\n+libblkmaker either version 0.4.2 or any version from 0.5.1 onward.\n+If you are solo mining, this will affect you the moment you upgrade Bitcoin\n+Core, which must be done prior to BIP66 achieving its 951/1001 status.\n+If you are mining with the stratum mining protocol: this does not affect you.\n+If you are mining with the getblocktemplate protocol to a pool: this will affect\n+you at the pool operator's discretion, which must be no later than BIP66\n+achieving its 951/1001 status.\n+\n+0.9.5 changelog\n+================\n+\n+- `74f29c2` Check pindexBestForkBase for null\n+- `9cd1dd9` Fix priority calculation in CreateTransaction\n+- `6b4163b` Sanitize command strings before logging them.\n+- `3230b32` Raise version of created blocks, and enforce DERSIG in mempool\n+- `989d499` Backport of some of BIP66's tests\n+- `ab03660` Implement BIP 66 validation rules and switchover logic\n+- `8438074` build: fix dynamic boost check when --with-boost= is used\n+\n+Credits\n+--------\n+\n+Thanks to who contributed to this release, at least:\n+\n+- 21E14\n+- Alex Morcos\n+- Cory Fields\n+- Gregory Maxwell\n+- Pieter Wuille\n+- Wladimir J. van der Laan\n+\n+As well as everyone that helped translating on [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/bitcoin/)."
