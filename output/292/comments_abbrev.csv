mikegogulski,2011-06-05T00:03:06Z,"The danger with the ""grab any PO"" advice above is that someone takes an existing EN->XX .po file and does the translation based on the XX rather than the EN. I confess, I'm being pedantic. I spent a few minutes trying to build a good example of how this can fail over three languages. The results weren't compelling, but translators can be _very_ creative! :)\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/292#issuecomment-1303109,1303109,
