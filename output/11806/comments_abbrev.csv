theuni,2017-12-06T21:02:39Z,utACK. Looks good to me after addressing @fanquake's [comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11806#issuecomment-348404246),https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11806#issuecomment-349773642,349773642,

laanwj,2017-12-01T12:09:24Z,"Shouldn't this check be right after `if test x$use_boost = xyes; then`, not after AX_BOOST_BASE?

theuni,2017-12-06T21:00:20Z,"Annoyingly, it's the AX_BOOST_BASE macro that does the --with-boost handling (along with the actual checks), and sets ""want_boost"" so this looks ok to me. Thankfully, the tests won't run if want_boost is false, so ""--without-boost"" should work as expected here.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11806#discussion_r155359394,155359394,configure.ac
