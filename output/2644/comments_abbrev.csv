jgarzik,2013-05-12T18:46:53Z,"Code looks sane and ACK-worthy.  The concept is similar to something I did in pynode.\n\nDid you actually instrument ""no effect on memory usage"", or is that a guess?  I would like to see before and after numbers proving that :)\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2644#issuecomment-17782949,17782949,
sipa,2013-05-12T19:45:14Z,"@jgarzik Just reasoning. For each CBlockIndex representing a node in the active chain, we remove 8 bytes from the CBlockIndex, and add 8 bytes to vBlockIndexByHeight. Actually, it should reduce memory usage slightly, as non-best-chain nodes also lose 8 bytes.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2644#issuecomment-17784069,17784069,
