It, however, dies sometimes and fails to test properly.  If you are waiting on a test, please check timestamps to verify that the test.log is moving at http://jenkins.bluematt.me/pull-tester/cu",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3420#issuecomment-30609300,30609300,
sipa,2013-12-15T15:53:36Z,"ACK, though I expect that maybe we'll need to update this further in future, based on runtime environments.\n\nA more long-term solution is perhaps introducing an own exception class for this, and checking it specifically.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3420#issuecomment-30609931,30609931,
Kangmo,2013-12-15T17:31:33Z,"Agreed with sipa, currently the test case was the only case expecting a specific type of exception thrown.\nThanks sipa for the comment!\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3420#issuecomment-30613743,30613743,
