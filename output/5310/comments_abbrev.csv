Diapolo,2014-11-28T16:29:55Z,Would have been quicker to merge instead of adding a tag :-P.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5310#issuecomment-64910720,64910720,
laanwj,2014-12-05T10:58:42Z,I'll cherry-pick the script_error change and leave bitcoinconsensus.h for now.\n\nMerged via 4c83c0e\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5310#issuecomment-65775001,65775001,
laanwj,2014-12-05T10:18:55Z,I'm not sure about this. `bitcoinconsensus.h` is a header that we export as interface. Having the internal directory structure reflected in it makes no sense then.\nEspecially as there is a large chance that it will move around later.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5310#discussion_r21364701,21364701,src/script/bitcoinconsensus.h
sipa,2014-12-05T10:26:04Z,"It should move to include/bitcoinconsensus.h, instead of being in src/script/, imho.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5310#discussion_r21364990,21364990,src/script/bitcoinconsensus.h
