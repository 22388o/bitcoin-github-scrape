dongcarl,2020-03-16 15:39:22,"Code Review ACK db146ecd7fabff3457102c9a6ef35d2bd1b7c3b0\nWould like it if we took the opportunity to make the syntax highlighting hints more uniform but no worries. (I'm guessing ""shell"" means POSIX-compliant shell?)",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18340#issuecomment-599605656,599605656,
fanquake,2020-03-18 00:05:08,"Given the syntax highlighting was pointed out twice, I've pushed to fix that up. I settled on using `bash` because that resulted in more highlighting in the editor I was looking at.  On GitHub using `bash` vs `shell` doesn't seem to make a difference.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18340#issuecomment-600358649,600358649,

vasild,2020-03-16 08:17:56,"nit: since you replaced `bash` with `shell` in `build-netbsd.md`, if you would be updating the patch, maybe `s/bash/shell/` also here in `build-openbsd.md`. But the patch is good to go as is IMO since its purpose is to deal with `MAKE=gmake` issue.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18340#discussion_r392846456,392846456,doc/build-openbsd.md
