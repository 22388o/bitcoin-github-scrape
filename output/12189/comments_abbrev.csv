Sjors,2018-01-15T15:43:10Z,"I think the transaction confirmation dialog should use the same unit as the send screen. So you could make two pull requests:\n\n1 - add sat / (v)byte to the dropdown on the send screen\n2 - add fee per (kilo)byte to the confirmation screen (this PR) \n\nNit: I would move the fee per size inside brackets at the end, e.g. ""0.00002220 BTC added as transaction fee (0.221 kB at 10.0452 sat/byte)""",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12189#issuecomment-357718179,357718179,
ericallam,2018-01-17T12:32:42Z,"@Sjors I agree that it's a good idea to do 2 different PRs for these changes. Adding the ability to specify custom fees in sat/vbyte is a decent chunk of work because of the way the Custom Fee text field reuses the `BitcoinAmountField` widget which is used in a couple different places in the UI (like when selecting an amount of BTC to send in a transaction, and to receive). \n\nI think the best ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12189#issuecomment-358290633,358290633,

jonasschnelli,2018-04-10T18:53:40Z,This may loos precision since formatBytes() does show 1.2kb as 1kb... not sure if this is a problem though. Maybe better keep it the way it was.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12189#discussion_r180531860,180531860,src/qt/sendcoinsdialog.cpp
