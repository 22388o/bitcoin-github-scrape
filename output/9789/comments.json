    "body": "Cory and I talked a bit about this in IRC.\r\n\r\nMy 2\u00a2:\r\n\r\nI think that the usefulness of travis is somewhat finicky. If builds are failing for some large set of style reasons, then this is going to really slow down feature branch development, where this can be fixed up later but getting functional results are more important. Or people will place lower value on red-x's from Travis during development if errors are frequent. Furthermore, just building locally isn't really an option as I think I'm not in the minority that use Travis to test against whatever build platforms travis tests. Ideally, Travis would have multi-axis failures, where you can say code passes functional tests but not style tests. Code that passes functional tests could be ready for review from others, and in some cases, nudging the compiler in the right direction is non-obvious (as is the case with some of the VLA things)! This could be done by only running style checks on bitcoin/bitcoin.\r\n\r\nOne problem with just enabling style checks on bitcoin/bitcoin (and not on forks) is that it will be really frustrating if you pass travis on your fork, and then you PR master and then it fails due to style checks you didn't run yourself.\r\n\r\nI think one way to do this is to add another (few?) travis build targets where strong-er flags are tested. That way, you can see easily if your build fail was from styler errors or from functional errors. It's not ideal in that a style failed build will still get an overall red-x, but at least one can see that a build fail was caused by style & not functionality without needing to muck around in the travis logs.\r\n\r\nAnother nice way to do this would be to add a style-check branch that has the style checks enabled, that one can PR-against on their own branch before PR'ing master, and only enable the style checks on any PR in bitcoin/bitcoin OR on PR to any branch named style-check.",
