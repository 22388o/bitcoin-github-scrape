theuni,2017-02-21T15:37:59Z,"@laanwj I like the idea of having Travis yell about new warnings. Not just this one.\n\nMany projects have an --enable-werror setting. How about we keep this as a warning, add a --enable-werror, and turn it on for travis (after cleaning up the straggler warnings we have)? We can always disable them case-by-case as they come up, and that keeps Werror from affecting regular user builds.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9789#issuecomment-281379916,281379916,

theuni,2017-02-22T06:58:15Z,"Updated. Split into 2 commits in case we want to backport the vla warning.\n\nWe'll definitely have to do some housecleaning if we enable Werror wholesale for Travis, and I suspect that will cause some grumbles about changing code for the sake of shutting up the compiler.\n\nSo maybe instead we should begin to slowly add warnings we definitely want Travis to error on?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9789#issuecomment-281586199,281586199,

JeremyRubin,2017-02-22T07:32:00Z,"Cory and I talked a bit about this in IRC.\n\nMy 2Â¢:\n\nI think that the usefulness of travis is somewhat finicky. If builds are failing for some large set of style reasons, then this is going to really slow down feature branch development, where this can be fixed up later but getting functional results are more important. Or people will place lower value on red-x's from Travis during developm",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9789#issuecomment-281591405,281591405,
laanwj,2017-02-22T08:28:34Z,"@JeremyRubin I agree in general but please, let's not get into that discussion here. This is not merely a style check! VLAs cause stack-protection to not work for that function, so effectively decrease the hardening of the code. I'm fine with making it the only warning that stops travis, but it should do that.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9789#issuecomment-281601985,281601985,
theuni,2017-02-23T06:08:56Z,"Ok, I narrowed werror to only vla's for now. We can add to the list as we come up with more obvious errors.\n\nAs @JeremyRubin had a few concerns about how to actually hook this up to travis, I left that out here. We can do that as a next step.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9789#issuecomment-281903919,281903919,
