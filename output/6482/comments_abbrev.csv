The performance improvement for transactions with lots of inputs is significant, but those transactions are pretty rare.\n\nSo, to do this safely, the wallet should only sign with SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY if it knows it has never signed any other transactions with an identical set of outputs.\n\",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6482#issuecomment-130829723,130829723,
