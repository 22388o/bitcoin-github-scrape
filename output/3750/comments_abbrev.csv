gavinandresen,2014-02-26T15:38:59Z,I need somebody to tell me the magic incantation to either:\n- build Qt5 from source in a way that we can distribute (-openssl-linked ? static libs versus framework ?)\n  or\n- compile against the downloaded Qt5 binary (distributed as a framework... I can't figure out  how to get autotools to link against it)\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3750#discussion_r10084068,10084068,doc/build-osx.md
laanwj,2014-02-26T15:53:15Z,"Yes using Qt5 as frameworks was tricky. I remember someone on IRC was doing that. It is a matter of making sure that the configure script can find the pkg-tool .pc files. But he also had to edit the .pc files to fix the include path, as somehow that was wrong in the framework release.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3750#discussion_r10084811,10084811,doc/build-osx.md
