This case has been violated twice, and overlooked twice by reviewers, so an automatic check seems helpful, if we agree that it should not be violated.\r\n\r\nOn that point, I agree with MarcoFalke: \"Including a cpp file seems extremely wrong.\"\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13230#discussion_r189439444\r\n\r\nThat said, I'm not clear how to value the cost of ~~having an extra file in the contrib/devtools directory, or~~ having this command run with each CI run.
