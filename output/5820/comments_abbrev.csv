sipa,2015-03-07T13:07:51Z,"@SergioDemianLerner I would really prefer avoiding checkpoints for this. Wouldn't a nHeight-based check be just as good to prevent that, similar to the check added in this patch?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5820#issuecomment-77688655,77688655,
SergioDemianLerner,2015-03-07T15:27:39Z,"We have several possibilities:\n1. Some basic housekeeping that can be done when a block is received during download to prevent strange things like blocks with a current time-stamp but low height. Assume for a moment that blocks before a checkpoint have a nTime field that are lower than the checkpoint time (generally this requires to check only about 12 previous blocks, although theoretically one ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5820#issuecomment-77693762,77693762,

You look at the\ndifference in nChainWork between the requested block and the best known\nheader, divided by the best difficulty seen, multiplied by the block\ninterval. This yields something with time units: the amount of time an\nattacker with 100% of the current observable hash rate would need to expend\nto build on top of the fork to beat the",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5820#issuecomment-77699290,77699290,
