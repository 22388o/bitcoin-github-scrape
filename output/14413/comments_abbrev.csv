ryanofsky,2018-10-08T02:17:05Z,"Code change seems reasonable, but I don't understand the issue. \n\nWhat would cause the RPC handler to become unregistered while the test framework is in `wait_for_rpc_connection`? Why would the nodes be getting shut down if the test framework isn't shutting them down?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14413#issuecomment-427707572,427707572,
MarcoFalke,2018-10-08T02:23:48Z,@ryanofsky If the node can't initialize itself shuts down itself without having the test framework shut it down.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14413#issuecomment-427708142,427708142,

MarcoFalke,2018-10-08T02:22:03Z,Maybe just `pass` this on as well? This way we'd make sure to always have an exit code as opposed to randomly this message or an exit code due to the racyness.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14413#discussion_r223238923,223238923,test/functional/test_framework/test_node.py
ryanofsky,2018-10-08T02:47:07Z,"I think this comment is confusing without mentioning why the server is shutting down.  Maybe change it to something like:\n\n```python\n# Service unavailable, RPC server started but is shutting down due to error\n```",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14413#discussion_r223240139,223240139,test/functional/test_framework/test_node.py
ryanofsky,2018-10-08T02:49:32Z,"Would it be good to call self.process.wait() here and include the exit code in the exception, so this is more similar to the previous FailedToStartError exception above?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14413#discussion_r223240287,223240287,test/functional/test_framework/test_node.py
