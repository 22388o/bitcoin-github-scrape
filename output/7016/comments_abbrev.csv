laanwj,2015-11-16T08:54:43Z,"Concept ACK\n\nThough what I think is interesting here is that we have a `severity` argument, just not the definition of `EVENT_LOG_WARN`. Looking at the changelog the old (now deprecated) name for EVENT_LOG_WARN was prefixed with an underscore. Can you try:\n\n```\n#ifndef EVENT_LOG_WARN\n#define EVENT_LOG_WARN _EVENT_LOG_WARN\n#endif\n```\n\nBTW: If you plan on doing any benchmarking or advanced",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7016#issuecomment-156958617,156958617,

gmaxwell,2015-11-14T20:38:31Z,Gah. What it doesn't to is it doesn't fail to compile; so much for type safety. Good spotting; thats what I get from changing from the always debug to always no debug at the last second. :-/\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7016#discussion_r44863288,44863288,src/httpserver.cpp
