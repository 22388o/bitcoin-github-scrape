    "body": "@mzumsande \r\n\r\n> I think the main issue is that this code is inside of a loop over the DNS seeds, and regtest doesn't have any. If there was a unreachable dummy dns seed for regtest, this could be tested:\r\nThreadDNSAddressSeed sleeps for 11s/5min depending on addrman size before querying, during this time one could add block-relay-only or full outbound peers and test that the behavior is different e.g. by looking at log messages.\r\n\r\nyup, this was the approach I took- added dummy seeds to regtest chain params & from the test made sure addrman has addresses & was asserting against log messages. the step I haven't been able to figure out is adding the connections during the sleep, with the test framework timing playing nicely with bitcoind timing. the branch is a bit of a mess, but lmk if you'd like me to clean it up and share- very possible I'm missing a viable solution!
