    "body": "> This discussion drifted away from the scope of this PR a bit - but what is the motivation behind the idea of replacing the `fRelay` mechanism by a MAX_FILTER feefilter?\r\n\r\nSorry about that \ud83d\ude05. AFAIK, `fRelay` was introduced as a `VERSION` field in BIP37 as a way to turn tx relay off until a bloom filter is sent. That means it's not very flexible, since you can't send multiple versions and we don't use bloom filters anymore.",
