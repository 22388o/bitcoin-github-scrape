sipa,2016-05-10T17:53:48Z,I'd make the buffers smaller (1 MiB?). That gives both more consistent times and more relevant results (it's hard to guess that the output is seconds per 32 MiB of data).\n\nTested ACK otherwise.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8039#issuecomment-218237617,218237617,

Or even 1MB - this is not a memory benchmark, there's no deep reason why this should be in MiB.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8039#issuecomment-218424883,218424883,
