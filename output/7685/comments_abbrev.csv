paveljanik,2016-03-15T20:12:26Z,Please remove `primitives/block.h` from the network layer. Compute the size of the block in `main.cpp` and pass the size instead of the block itself into `FilterStatsProcessBlock()`.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7685#discussion_r56232088,56232088,src/net.h
jonasschnelli,2016-03-16T16:39:02Z,"I have also thought about this during the time of writing the code. I think its more flexible the way it is now. `FilterStatsProcessBlock` could also count transactions or the total amount of vins/vouts per block (which is basically where the filter needs to ""go through"").\n\nIncluding `block.h` should be not a problem.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7685#discussion_r56367990,56367990,src/net.h
