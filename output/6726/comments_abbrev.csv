And other nodes accepting txs over the network don't care about (high) fees when adding them to their own mempool.

sipa,2015-09-26T12:35:25Z,@laanwj The reason the fee check in AcceptToMemoryPool exists is because\nthere is no other way to sanity check the fee of raw transactions. Wallet\ntransactions are always created with a known fee anyway.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6726#issuecomment-143433087,143433087,
jonasschnelli,2015-09-28T06:52:57Z,I understand the motivation of this PR.\nDoes it make sense to have this absurde-fee-checks in the mempool logic? I think the mempool should not enforce a such policy.\n\nConceptual i think having a function that could check if a transaction would be accepted to the mempool (or `AcceptToMemoryPool()` with a `dontAdd` boolean).\n\nIMO the wallets send functions as well as the `sendrawtransaction` R,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6726#issuecomment-143655291,143655291,
