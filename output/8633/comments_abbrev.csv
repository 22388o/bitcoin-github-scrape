theuni,2016-09-01T18:19:29Z,"I'm hitting a slightly different problem [here](https://travis-ci.org/bitcoin/bitcoin/jobs/156677791) where the boost test itself appears to be taking >10min. I addressed that here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8631/commits/195f143df82694ddfb92c7fc4c667c1f6ef92211, which simply skips the automake test harness altogether for travis.

JeremyRubin,2016-09-09T17:38:39Z,"@MarcoFalke Well, sometimes it can be hard to reproduce why a test is timing out locally & eat a lot of dev time to build windows or whatever.\n\nThis also means that if tests ever grow to take more than 10 minutes (just because there are a lot of them) it will keep working so long as no individual test is that long.
