laanwj,2014-03-13T10:08:09Z,This should definitely be worked around. Requiring boost 1.55 is not acceptable IMO.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3857#issuecomment-37516689,37516689,
zander,2014-03-13T17:28:06Z,"I'm not sure how to work around the issue, but I cleaned up the commit as a simple docs commit so its hopefully mergable anyway.\n\nAdditionally, it seems my initial assesment was wrong, this compile issue was not due to any change in bitcoin. I failed to compile even various months old versions of the 0.9.0 branch against boost1.54.  The issue is certainly not a showstopper AFAICT.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3857#issuecomment-37561178,37561178,

laanwj,2014-03-13T15:20:23Z,ACK on this as well. Boost 1.37 is ancient.\nThough which boost version is available exactly depends on the distribution...\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3857#discussion_r10569033,10569033,doc/build-unix.md
