    "body": "This seems like a moderately important area for optimization.  One thing that might be worth keeping in mind:  It would probably be useful to support a \"fast but imprecise\" accounting method for the first block template after a new block.  This is really easy to do with the current code (just skip updating the costs while inserting transactions), not sure if your work would change that.\r\n\r\n[Aside, usually when talking about improving asymptotic complexity people ignore constant factors. You might want to use different language when describing this work to avoid confusing people.]\r\n\r\nIn theory, I think the common case where confirmation includes an entire disjoint subgraph at once it should be possible to make that linear time (by basically noticing that the entire subgraph is removed, so any cost updates can be skipped).  Interestingly: for attack resistance the worst case (permitted by policy) is what matters... but for revenue reasons the average case is more important.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if there are greater wins though from speedups or from latency hiding hacks. e.g. if one keeps a small redundant highest fee only mempool perhaps without CPFP dependency tracking at all, and uses it while the real stuff is updating in the background... then it probably doesn't matter that much if the main mempool is taking tens of seconds.",

    "body": "Thanks for the review @gmaxwell.\r\n\r\nI think the \"fast but imprecise\" accounting method is not affected at all by this change, but someone who has implemented that should verify.\r\n\r\nI've also used the terminology correctly RE: asymptotes. Imagine a set of O(N) transactions which each have 1 output, and a single transaction which spends all outputs. Assembling the ancestors (e.g., in CalculateMemPoolAncestors) will iterate over O(N) inputs and make O(N log N) comparisons in set entries. In the new code I've written, you do O(N) work as it's O(1) (rather than O(log N)) to query if we've already included it.\r\n\r\nNow, you're correct to note that in the benchmark I gave, it's only a constant factor. This is the purpose of the benchmark; a \"believable\" transaction workload. As noted above, the O(N^2) work manifests as a result of the structure of that test specifically -- you have N transactions you're inserting into the mempool, and you need to percolate the updated package info up the tree every insert. Thus, you end up making N*N traversals. Thus, short of some sort of magic metadata data structure, any implementation's improvements will manifest lower-bounded by W(N^2).\r\n\r\nI can generate some micro benchmarks which show that Epoch Mempool beats out the status quo in asymptotes. I figured it's less interesting than showing it's better in the domain of believable workloads, because while it's easy to see that these algorithms win in the asymptotes, it's less clear that they win on realistic workloads.\r\n\r\nAlso, some of the \"composed\" algorithms have two parts -- one half is improved by this PR, and the other half isn't -- yet. For example in addUnchecked, we have two components: 1 builds setParentTransactions and the other calls UpdateParent on everything in setParentTransactions. Normally, building setParentTransactions is O(N log N), but with this update it becomes O(N). However, the *internals* of UpdateParent are  an ordered set, so we gain back the log N factor. However future work can update those data structures to make UpdateParent O(1).\r\n\r\nTo your point about making subtree detaching O(N), this work actually already does that moslty. removeRecursive was previously O(N log N), with this PR it is now basically O(N) (we skip the metadata updating in removeRecursive's call to RemoveStaged with updateDescendants = false, but removeUnchecked removes n items from a std::set so it regains a log(n) factor, but it's a pretty conceptually easy follow up PR to make txlinksMap a std::unordered_set).\r\n\r\nI haven't pushed the changes I was working on w.r.t. changing the std::sets to std::unordered_sets because while conceptually simple, they have a lot more edge case in if it will be better or worse (esp when it comes to memory). So the epoch's seemed like a better one as there's really no downside.",
