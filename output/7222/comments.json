    "body": "Concept ACK\n\n> Which RPC calls should return this information?\n\nI think at least `listtransaction`, `gettransaction` (wallet functions) should also support this.\n\n> Would it be helpful to distinguish between a transaction signaling RBF itself [...], versus inheriting the signal from some unconfirmed parent?\n\nYes. This would be useful IMO.\n\n> The answer can only be definitive for transactions that are in the mempool; transactions that are not in the mempool might have unknown parents which could signal RBF and we wouldn't know it. Is it worth trying to answer this question for transactions not in the mempool, and if so, what information should be returned?\n\nI don't see a use-case for getting the RBF signal for confirmed transactions (maybe for potential reorgs risk calculations?). But I agree, without `-txindex`, parents RBF signal is probably unknown.\n",

    "body": "@petertodd  I don't agree, but I can understand your concern about offering a feature that could mislead users.  So rather than change existing RPC calls as I initially proposed, what about just adding two new RPC calls, one that would return the txid's of unconfirmed parents of a transaction and one that would return txid's of in-mempool descendants?  That seems to me to be more broadly useful and basically addresses my underlying concern, that users who want to do calculations relating to whether a transaction might be replaced would have to reinvent the wheel to efficiently trace mempool chains.\n",

    "body": "Pardon my tardy response. With due respect to the prior arguments, they're more strongly an argument against showing unconfirmed transactions at all by default. Not against this.\n\nAn indicator for BIP125 (in particular, in listtransactions) would be both labor saving for users, and also make it more likely that parties looking at it get it right (and, for example, don't consider confirmed transactions to be BIP125 mempool replaceable).\n\nMoreover, it was always my expectation that it would work this way-- and this small affordance is an aspect of how I explained BIP125 to others without getting any protest so I expect many also expected this. Importantly, while many people do objectively confused things with unconfirmed transactions, the elegance of BIP125 was that it avoided the difficult task of educating people which so far many have failed with; by providing something that allowed their activities to continue without conflict. But it doesn't do so if getting access to the information is too burdensome. Because of this I consider this a release blocker.\n\nI was concerned that the patch for this would be complex, but it turns out to be quite clean... which I think makes this a no-brainer. \n",

    "body": "On further thought I've removed the opt-in RBF signaling information in `getrawmempool`. I  timed that RPC call -- without this change -- on a node with a large mempool and it took over 6seconds.   Potentially multiplying that by the average chain length (limit of 25 by default) seems like a bad performance hit to suddenly introduce.\n\nI had an issue with the build not working after pulling the code out of `rpcblockchain.cpp`; the second commit which moves `policy/rbf.cpp` to `libbitcoin_wallet` seems to be a workaround.  I imagine there may be a better way of fixing the build, but leaving it here for now to make travis happy and so the rest of this pull can be reviewed.  We can replace or squash the second commit as appropriate...\n\n@cfields Thanks for looking at this; let me know if you figure out a better way to make everything work.\n",
