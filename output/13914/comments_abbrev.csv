fanquake,2018-08-09T01:20:51Z,"NACK in it's current form. When building on macOS, this generates, and fills the build output with hundreds of warnings from our dependencies (mostly libevent and openssl).

Empact,2018-08-10T21:11:33Z,"I am working on a way of fixing the dependency warning issue. The steps to that are:\n1) Move tinyformat to a subtree or subdir (#13845 #13846)\n2) Move dependency includes from `-I` to `-isystem` (wip here: https://github.com/Empact/bitcoin/tree/isystem)\n\nUsed -Wzero-as-null-pointer-constant to drive it out.
