practicalswift,2019-03-17T17:17:57Z,@pstratem Thanks for clarifying! Any other intentional deviations from a pure refactoring? :-),https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15613#issuecomment-473686055,473686055,
pstratem,2019-03-17T17:39:04Z,@practicalswift the timing constraint is changed from > to >= as it's measured in microseconds. a ping time of zero seconds is almost certainly in error.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15613#issuecomment-473687886,473687886,
