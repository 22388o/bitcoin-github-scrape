MarcoFalke,2021-11-20 07:39:49,This is an invalid call. Can you explain why you are changing this line in the first place?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23558#discussion_r753647164,753647164,test/functional/rpc_generateblock.py
DariusParvin,2021-11-20 07:53:41,ah okay I didn't appreciate the difference I had made. I've changed the calls back to how they were before.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23558#discussion_r753648129,753648129,test/functional/rpc_generateblock.py
MarcoFalke,2021-11-20 07:55:45,"why are the named args removed? Again, why is this line changed at all?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23558#discussion_r753648301,753648301,test/functional/rpc_generateblock.py
DariusParvin,2021-11-20 07:59:22,The args were not named on the other calls so I removed it here for consistency too. I've added it back so that it's the same as before.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23558#discussion_r753648517,753648517,test/functional/rpc_generateblock.py
