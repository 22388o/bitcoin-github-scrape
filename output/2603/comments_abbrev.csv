gavinandresen,2013-05-02T18:40:25Z,ACK.\n\nTested by removing the bestblock record from a -testnet wallet.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2603#issuecomment-17356234,17356234,

petertodd,2013-05-20T08:07:23Z,Looks like if you delete your wallet after Bitcoin creates the new one it triggers a rescan of every block.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2603#issuecomment-18136356,18136356,
sipa,2013-05-20T22:27:12Z,"Indeed, I'll look at this. It's not a regression though, before there was just a chance of missing stuff, as no accurate bestblock was written either.\n\nThe solution is doing an explicit write of the bestblock record at wallet unload/exit time.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2603#issuecomment-18177957,18177957,
gmaxwell,2013-05-20T22:35:10Z,If we knew the bestblock at the time we created the wallet (I don't think we've loaded the chain at that point) it would be simple to just have it set the best block to be the current best block when creating it.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2603#issuecomment-18178278,18178278,
gmaxwell,2013-05-21T00:56:40Z,Another possible fix is doing the key birthday thing and using the min(birthday) to control the rescan. \n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2603#issuecomment-18183116,18183116,
sipa,2013-05-21T01:08:50Z,"@gmaxwell That'd be a nice improvement, but doesn't change the fact that we need to write updated bestblock records more frequently to avoid spurious rescans.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2603#issuecomment-18183493,18183493,
