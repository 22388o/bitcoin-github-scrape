gavinandresen,2011-04-25T00:39:31Z,"Can you start a forum thread about this?  There was some concern about possible attacks revealing private keys if the attacker can send arbitrary data to be signed.\n\nAlso some nits:  indentation looks messed up on the git diff, and isn't there a better way to get a string into a vector<unsigned char> ?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/183#issuecomment-1051317,1051317,

amiryal,2011-05-07T16:15:59Z,"Nice work, khalahan; thanks!\n\nI am not familiar with the JSON RPC protocol, so this may be a silly question: is it necessary for the server to echo some of the parameters back to the caller?

sipa,2011-05-08T12:20:51Z,"The pubkey can indeed not be inferred from the address.
