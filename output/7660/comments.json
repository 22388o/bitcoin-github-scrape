    "body": "I don't know what is the expected usage, but wouldn't it be simpler to just add a CFeeRate::GetFeeSatoshis(size) method ?\nMaybe that would be too disruptive for the indended use, I don't really know.\n\nEDIT: \nAlthough it may look unrelated, maybe this would also a good opportunity to move CFeeRate, CTxOut::GetDustThreshold() and CTxOut::IsDust() finally out of libconsensus. Something like https://github.com/jtimon/bitcoin/commit/dc1b96d368d471ea5242ca021148f9f900f69661 or #5114 but maybe not based on #6068, since #6068 seems extremely hard for reasons I still don't understand. I guess I just leave it there in case someone wants to rebase or rewrite such a thing. Sorry, I cannot help remembering every time I review changes in amount.o.\n",
