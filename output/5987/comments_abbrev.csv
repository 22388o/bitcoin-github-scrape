They could also disable checkpoints in their test, but I don't have\na strong opinion: I'm fine removing it if that's the motivation.\nWhat about the rest of my feedback (ie making sure all ghains have a\ngenesis checkpoint and using hardcoded values as little as possible)?\",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5987#issuecomment-141907816,141907816,
