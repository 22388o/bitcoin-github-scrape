ryanofsky,2017-08-03T15:52:21Z,"In commit ""Always wait for threadGroup to exit in bitcoind shutdown""\n\nThis is a nice change and seems safe given what you describe in your commit message. I guess we should look out for shutdown issues with #10286, though, since after #10286, the part about ""validationinterface has an effectively-dummy reference to [CScheduler]"" will no longer be true\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10919#discussion_r131182240,131182240,src/bitcoind.cpp
ryanofsky,2017-08-03T16:19:55Z,"In commit ""Fix resume-of-reindex-after-restart""\n\nMaybe make this more specific. You could say ""From here on out fReindex may be true even if fReset is false (indicating the node was shut down mid-reindex).""",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10919#discussion_r131189526,131189526,src/init.cpp
