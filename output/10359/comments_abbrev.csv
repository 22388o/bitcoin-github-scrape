jnewbery,2017-05-31T21:50:54Z,"rebased. It'd be really helpful to get this merged so we can make some progress on #10082 . This is the only disruptive changeset in that larger PR - the rest of the changes are restricted to the test_framework directory.\n\nThis PR touches a lot of files, but it should be a trivial review. It's simply changing calls from `stop_node()` to calls to `self.stop_node()` etc wrapper functions in the ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10359#issuecomment-305328139,305328139,

jimmysong,2017-05-31T22:27:39Z,The plan is to change `start_node` so assignment here would be unnecessary in the future?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10359#discussion_r119489745,119489745,test/functional/abandonconflict.py

jimmysong,2017-05-31T22:30:14Z,I assume that `self.start_nodes` would also do the assignment in the future?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10359#discussion_r119490155,119490155,test/functional/fundrawtransaction.py
jimmysong,2017-05-31T22:31:35Z,Nit: I personally like comma endings so adding new imports has cleaner diffs.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10359#discussion_r119490360,119490360,test/functional/net.py
ryanofsky,2017-05-31T22:33:56Z,Maybe move these up one line so nodes[1].encrypt and pop(1) can be next to each other.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10359#discussion_r119490758,119490758,test/functional/fundrawtransaction.py

jnewbery,2017-06-01T14:05:36Z,yes - that's certainly something we can do in a future PR once the BitcoinTestFramework class is responsible for tracking and stop/starting the nodes.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10359#discussion_r119622762,119622762,test/functional/abandonconflict.py
