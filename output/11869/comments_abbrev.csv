By defintion, if they're unspendable they're not part of the utxo, right?\nI don't quite get why, but changing the genesis block of regtest (ie using the custom regtest proposed in #8994 ) makes this function return unspendable utxos and thus make segwit.py fail.\nOr in other words, I don't quite get why the function",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11869#issuecomment-351067792,351067792,
