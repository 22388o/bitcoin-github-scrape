If your testing setups were identical (started with the same fee estimates and started the nodes at the same time), then the way you might see substantial differences is if your testing nodes have to catch up a little bit when you start them, then this code will decay your old estimates and the old code",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9138#issuecomment-263027165,263027165,
