    "body": "Couple of things that I wanted to discuss and I don't think there will be a better place because its related to Bitcoin Core and Tor:\r\n\r\n1. Dandelion++ was not implemented in Bitcoin Core. Details here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/20203 So Tor is very important for Bitcoin Core users. How do we make it easier for everyone to use and get more users running onion service when using Bitcoin Core? Maybe make the documentation user friendly? Can we add few screenshots? Can we add using Bitcoin Core on Android using ABCore or Nayuta as mentioned in the last part here: https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/98913/how-to-run-bitcoin-core-as-onion-service-on-windows-ubuntu-and-android\r\n\r\n2. Tor recently had a [consensus bug](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/tor/-/issues/40237) and I think it has lot of issues which are regularly exploited on different levels with some of them mentioned here: http://hackerfactor.com/blog/index.php?/archives/906-Tor-0day-The-Management-Vulnerability.html How do we improve privacy in Bitcoin Core without being dependent on Tor which has its own issues to deal with? Can we contact the author of this above mentioned blog and request to patch Tor for a good use (Bitcoin Core) and we maintain a fork of Tor? Are there enough developers interested to work on something like this which will involve lot of code, review, tests etc. ? \r\n\r\nI tried asking on Twitter but there was no response: https://twitter.com/prayankgahlot/status/1305919047398162434",

    "diff_hunk": "@@ -117,37 +117,104 @@ for normal IPv4/IPv6 communication, use:\n \n ## 3. Automatically create a Bitcoin Core onion service\n \n-Starting with Tor version 0.2.7.1 it is possible, through Tor's control socket\n-API, to create and destroy 'ephemeral' onion services programmatically.\n-Bitcoin Core has been updated to make use of this.\n-\n-This means that if Tor is running (and proper authentication has been configured),\n-Bitcoin Core automatically creates an onion service to listen on. This will positively\n-affect the number of available .onion nodes.\n-\n-This new feature is enabled by default if Bitcoin Core is listening (`-listen`), and\n-requires a Tor connection to work. It can be explicitly disabled with `-listenonion=0`\n-and, if not disabled, configured using the `-torcontrol` and `-torpassword` settings.\n-To show verbose debugging information, pass `-debug=tor`.\n-\n-Connecting to Tor's control socket API requires one of two authentication methods to be\n-configured. It also requires the control socket to be enabled, e.g. put `ControlPort 9051`\n-in `torrc` config file. For cookie authentication the user running bitcoind must have read\n-access to the `CookieAuthFile` specified in Tor configuration. In some cases this is\n-preconfigured and the creation of an onion service is automatic. If permission problems\n-are seen with `-debug=tor` they can be resolved by adding both the user running Tor and\n-the user running bitcoind to the same group and setting permissions appropriately. On\n-Debian-based systems the user running bitcoind can be added to the debian-tor group,\n-which has the appropriate permissions. Before starting bitcoind you will need to re-login\n-to allow debian-tor group to be applied. Otherwise you will see the following notice: \"tor:\n-Authentication cookie /run/tor/control.authcookie could not be opened (check permissions)\"\n-on debug.log.\n-\n-An alternative authentication method is the use\n-of the `-torpassword=password` option. The `password` is the clear text form that\n-was used when generating the hashed password for the `HashedControlPassword` option\n-in the tor configuration file. The hashed password can be obtained with the command\n-`tor --hash-password password` (read the tor manual for more details).\n+Bitcoin Core makes use of Tor's control socket API to create and destroy\n+ephemeral onion services programmatically. This means that if Tor is running and\n+proper authentication has been configured, Bitcoin Core automatically creates an\n+onion service to listen on. The goal is to increase the number of available\n+onion nodes.\n+\n+This feature is enabled by default if Bitcoin Core is listening (`-listen`) and\n+it requires a Tor connection to work. It can be explicitly disabled with\n+`-listenonion=0`. If it is not disabled, it can be configured using the\n+`-torcontrol` and `-torpassword` settings.\n+\n+To see verbose Tor information in the bitcoind debug log, pass `-debug=tor`.\n+\n+### Control Port\n+\n+You may need to set up the Tor Control Port. On most Linux distributions there\n+will be the following commented-out settings in `/etc/tor/torrc`:\n+\n+```\n+ControlPort 9051\n+CookieAuthentication 1\n+CookieAuthFileGroupReadable 1",
