gmaxwell,2014-12-27T09:52:44Z,Please explain to me why 148.251.238.178 is still staying pinned up to every node in the network? It was my understanding that after the last round of concerns you said you would discontinue that behaviour.\n\nAre you saying you have no other hosts connecting outbound at large scale to the network than 148.251.238.178?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5545#issuecomment-68174085,68174085,

ayeowch,2014-12-27T10:16:56Z,@luke-jr My background is in networking so I may be looking at different perspective as I imagine it is inefficient to disconnect from nodes that you are already connected to if you are going to connect to them again after hearing about them from addr response from a peer in the next crawl.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5545#issuecomment-68174550,68174550,
