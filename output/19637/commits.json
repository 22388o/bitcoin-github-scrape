Wait until it has completely\n+shut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run the\n+installer (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt` (on Mac)\n+or `bitcoind`/`bitcoin-qt` (on Linux).\n+\n+Upgrading directly from a version of Bitcoin Core that has reached its EOL is\n+possible, but it might take some time if the data directory needs to be migrated. Old\n+wallet versions of Bitcoin Core are generally supported.\n+\n+Compatibility\n+==============\n+\n+Bitcoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systems\n+using the Linux kernel, macOS 10.12+, and Windows 7 and newer.  Bitcoin\n+Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not as\n+frequently tested on them.  It is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core on\n+unsupported systems.\n+\n+From Bitcoin Core 0.20.0 onwards, macOS versions earlier than 10.12 are no\n+longer supported. Additionally, Bitcoin Core does not yet change appearance\n+when macOS \"dark mode\" is activated.\n+\n+Known Bugs\n+==========\n+\n+The process for generating the source code release (\"tarball\") has changed in an\n+effort to make it more complete, however, there are a few regressions in\n+this release:\n+\n+- The generated `configure` script is currently missing, and you will need to\n+  install autotools and run `./autogen.sh` before you can run\n+  `./configure`. This is the same as when checking out from git.\n+\n+- Instead of running `make` simply, you should instead run\n+  `BITCOIN_GENBUILD_NO_GIT=1 make`.\n+\n+Notable changes\n+===============\n+\n+Changes regarding misbehaving peers\n+-----------------------------------\n+\n+Peers that misbehave (e.g. send us invalid blocks) are now referred to as\n+discouraged nodes in log output, as they're not (and weren't) strictly banned:\n+incoming connections are still allowed from them, but they're preferred for\n+eviction.\n+\n+Furthermore, a few additional changes are introduced to how discouraged\n+addresses are treated:\n+\n+- Discouraging an address does not time out automatically after 24 hours\n+  (or the `-bantime` setting). Depending on traffic from other peers,\n+  discouragement may time out at an indeterminate time.\n+\n+- Discouragement is not persisted over restarts.\n+\n+- There is no method to list discouraged addresses. They are not returned by\n+  the `listbanned` RPC. That RPC also no longer reports the `ban_reason`\n+  field, as `\"manually added\"` is the only remaining option.\n+\n+- Discouragement cannot be removed with the `setban remove` RPC command.\n+  If you need to remove a discouragement, you can remove all discouragements by\n+  stop-starting your node.\n+\n+Notification changes\n+--------------------\n+\n+`-walletnotify` notifications are now sent for wallet transactions that are\n+removed from the mempool because they conflict with a new block. These\n+notifications were sent previously before the v0.19 release, but had been\n+broken since that release (bug\n+[#18325](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/18325)).\n+\n+PSBT changes\n+------------\n+\n+PSBTs will contain both the non-witness utxo and the witness utxo for segwit\n+inputs in order to restore compatibility with wallet software that are now\n+requiring the full previous transaction for segwit inputs. The witness utxo\n+is still provided to maintain compatibility with software which relied on its\n+existence to determine whether an input was segwit.\n+\n+0.20.1 change log\n+=================\n+\n+### Mining\n+- #19019 Fix GBT: Restore \"!segwit\" and \"csv\" to \"rules\" key (luke-jr)\n+\n+### P2P protocol and network code\n+- #19219 Replace automatic bans with discouragement filter (sipa)\n+\n+### Wallet\n+- #19300 Handle concurrent wallet loading (promag)\n+- #18982 Minimal fix to restore conflicted transaction notifications (ryanofsky)\n+\n+### RPC and other APIs\n+- #19524 Increment input value sum only once per UTXO in decodepsbt (fanquake)\n+- #19517 psbt: Increment input value sum only once per UTXO in decodepsbt (achow101)\n+- #19215 psbt: Include and allow both non_witness_utxo and witness_utxo for segwit inputs (achow101)\n+\n+### GUI\n+- #19097 Add missing QPainterPath include (achow101)\n+- #19059 update Qt base translations for macOS release (fanquake)\n+\n+### Build system\n+- #19152 improve build OS configure output (skmcontrib)\n+- #19536 qt, build: Fix QFileDialog for static builds (hebasto)\n+\n+### Tests and QA\n+- #19444 Remove cached directories and associated script blocks from appveyor config (sipsorcery)\n+- #18640 appveyor: Remove clcache (MarcoFalke)\n+\n+### Miscellaneous\n+- #19194 util: Don't reference errno when pthread fails (miztake)\n+- #18700 Fix locking on WSL using flock instead of fcntl (meshcollider)\n+\n+Credits\n+=======\n+\n+Thanks to everyone who directly contributed to this release:\n+\n+- Aaron Clauson\n+- Andrew Chow\n+- fanquake\n+- Hennadii Stepanov\n+- Jo\u00e3o Barbosa\n+- Luke Dashjr\n+- MarcoFalke\n+- MIZUTA Takeshi\n+- Pieter Wuille\n+- Russell Yanofsky\n+- sachinkm77\n+- Samuel Dobson\n+- Wladimir J. van der Laan\n+\n+As well as to everyone that helped with translations on\n+[Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/)."
