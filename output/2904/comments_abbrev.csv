gmaxwell,2013-08-16T05:03:24Z,"So, the design choices here were to reuse or prompt when the keypool ran dry.  Reuse has the advantage that the behavior would never change even when the pool empties, but it would reuse a previously assigned address, which is really surprising.  There would also be an option to reuse after prompting if the wallet didn't unlock. \n\nCodeshark, said prompt on empty. I agree.
