    "body": "While this is advertised (e.g. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=665191.0) as a decentralized redlist proposal what is actually does is quite different\u2014 it polls a hard coded URL and blocks whatever it returns, an overtly centralized mechanism.\n\nEven the few fringe people with a poor understanding of the important of fungibility as a social fiction (\u2014 which is all it is even for classic forms of fiat currency) to enable money like goods to be useful would not find a mechanism with some unspecific central control desirable; and there is no existence proof for a globally accepted authority for the censorship of monetary transactions anywhere now or in history.\n\nBack to the effects on the network\u2014 and ignoring the moral and economic implications this functionality, the mechanism presented here guarantees no consistency between participants. It doesn't even make an effort to achieve consistency beyond hoping all users use the same central authority at the same time and that authority gives an identical list to every user. Because node running this code will attempt to reorganize the chain (at least for a depth of 2) based on inconsistent information even transactions unrelated to the blacklist may be reversed and replaced with competing spends. This reduction in convergence reliability will cause innocent unrelated third parties to be robbed. While this kind of block discouragement has been proposed previously and could be an effective tool for certain network upgrade situations, the lack of any method to ensure that the enforcing side would be consistent would be very bad for convergence.\n\nMost importantly, I am relatively confident that practically no one would run code containing this software. Obviously you are free to go run it yourself or encourage other people to do so (though, for my own part I would strenuously encourage them not to), but including it in this repository would accomplish nothing of value except cause users to obtain their Bitcoin software from another source. (But it is nice to see proposals come with source!)\n\nCheers.\n",

    "body": "Incidentally, I coined the term \"redlist\" exactly so we could talk about a _very different_ system than this. It's quite annoying to see you take that term and use it to mean blacklisting, did the term blacklist not appeal or something? Please don't mis-appropriate terminology like that in future, these discussions are complex enough without people deliberately muddying the waters by redefining terms on the fly.\n",
