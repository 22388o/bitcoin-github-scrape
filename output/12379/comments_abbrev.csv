Sjors,2018-02-20T17:57:43Z,"I ran `test_runner.py` on MacOS 10.13.3. `wallet_encryption.py`, `wallet_multiwallet.py` and `wallet_multiwallet.py --usecli` failed. I ran them again individually and they still failed. See [logs](https://gist.github.com/Sjors/fcd54278678d989e37f8a478c7e01498). The first test fails on master too (see #12375), but those other two pass on master (ffc6e48b2).",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12379#issuecomment-367063010,367063010,
