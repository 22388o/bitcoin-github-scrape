MarcoFalke,2015-11-16T12:17:22Z,> I think we should remove the if.\n\n@laanwj did not like that.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6951#issuecomment-157011021,157011021,

It's a ""belt-and-suspenders check"".\nSo, it shouldn't hurt and might protect from insane fees if we once change the wallet layer.\n\nChanged my mind:\nTested ACK.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6951#issuecomment-157011586,157011586,
