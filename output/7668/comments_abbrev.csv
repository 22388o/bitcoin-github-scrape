History is not deleted after font size changed in the UI.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7668#issuecomment-195495801,195495801,
jonasschnelli,2016-03-11T19:02:27Z,"Hmm... when I had implemented this, I encountered that the font size change only works after clearing the console (because of some html subsystem). The console content should be restored at L494.\n\nAre you sure the console window gets cleared when changing the font size? If so, what platform?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7668#issuecomment-195499556,195499556,
achow101,2016-03-11T19:05:30Z,"@jonasschnelli It isn't the console, but rather the history in the text box for commands. When you hit the up arrow you can choose a previously entered command but after changing the font size that history is cleared. This fixes that\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7668#issuecomment-195500980,195500980,
