JeremyRubin,2017-01-19T04:16:54Z,Maybe move the declarations (not definitions) to the header?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9579#discussion_r96789914,96789914,src/net_processing.cpp
JeremyRubin,2017-01-19T04:22:19Z,"I think CNetMsgMaker::Make could be const, which might be worth doing to be able to make this reference const.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9579#discussion_r96790259,96790259,src/net_processing.cpp
jtimon,2017-01-21T09:16:47Z,The idea was to leave them as static rather than expose them (unless someone else wants to expose some of them later). Perhaps I should have started from the top to avoid the extra declarations. No big deal for me to change it if we decide to divide the whole function ala #9579,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9579#discussion_r97194811,97194811,src/net_processing.cpp
