achow101,2017-06-08T23:31:17Z,"NACK `-testsafemode` is not unused. It is part of GetWarnings and will set a warning for strStatusBar, strRPC, and strGUI which will then trigger the safe mode handling of RPCs. Safe mode is still used in the RPCs to disable certain RPCs if safe mode is enabled.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10560#issuecomment-307255188,307255188,
practicalswift,2017-06-08T23:44:45Z,"@achow101 Ah, sorry. I missed that the safe mode logic in `OnRPCPreCommand` is triggered by `strRPC != nullptr` (via `GetWarnings(""rpc"")` :-)  Thanks for clarifying.

practicalswift,2017-06-09T05:25:54Z,@achow101 I intentionally left it commented out instead of removing it. By commenting it out we get rid of unused constant warnings until it is used :-),https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10560#discussion_r121051130,121051130,src/consensus/validation.h
