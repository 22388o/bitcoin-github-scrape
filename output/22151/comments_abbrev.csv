hebasto,2021-06-07 13:14:48,"> What will the effect of these changes to the `xlf` to translators? Do all the messages go back to untranslated or unreviewed?\n\nI don't know for sure (it is out of my personal experience, and it is not documented by Transifex).\n\nExpecting the following:\n- the ""Translated"" status will not be changed\n- the ""Reviewed"" status will be set to ""No""",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22151#issuecomment-855917095,855917095,

But it could change the internal Transifex machinery behavior in a way that would make additional post-processing in bitcoin-core/bitcoin-maintainer-tools#103 unneeded (that is only my guess).\",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22151#issuecomment-855947535,855947535,
