Wait until it has completely\n+shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the\n+installer (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt` (on Mac)\n+or `bitcoind`/`bitcoin-qt` (on Linux).\n+\n+Upgrading directly from a version of Bitcoin Core that has reached its EOL is\n+possible, but it might take some time if the datadir needs to be migrated. Old\n+wallet versions of Bitcoin Core are generally supported.\n+\n+Compatibility\n+==============\n+\n+Bitcoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systems using\n+the Linux kernel, macOS 10.10+, and Windows 7 and newer. It is not recommended\n+to use Bitcoin Core on unsupported systems.\n+\n+Bitcoin Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not\n+as frequently tested on them.\n+\n+From Bitcoin Core 0.17.0 onwards, macOS versions earlier than 10.10 are no\n+longer supported, as Bitcoin Core is now built using Qt 5.9.x which requires\n+macOS 10.10+. Additionally, Bitcoin Core does not yet change appearance when\n+macOS \"dark mode\" is activated.\n+\n+In addition to previously supported CPU platforms, this release's pre-compiled\n+distribution provides binaries for the RISC-V platform.\n+\n+0.19.1 change log\n+=================\n+\n+### Wallet\n+- #17643 Fix origfee return for bumpfee with feerate arg (instagibbs)\n+- #16963 Fix `unique_ptr` usage in boost::signals2 (promag)\n+- #17258 Fix issue with conflicted mempool tx in listsinceblock (adamjonas, mchrostowski)\n+- #17924 Bug: IsUsedDestination shouldn't use key id as script id for ScriptHash (instagibbs)\n+- #17621 IsUsedDestination should count any known single-key address (instagibbs)\n+- #17843 Reset reused transactions cache (fjahr)\n+\n+### RPC and other APIs\n+- #17687 cli: Fix fatal leveldb error when specifying -blockfilterindex=basic twice (brakmic)\n+- #17728 require second argument only for scantxoutset start action (achow101)\n+- #17445 zmq: Fix due to invalid argument and multiple notifiers (promag)\n+- #17524 psbt: handle unspendable psbts (achow101)\n+- #17156 psbt: check that various indexes and amounts are within bounds (achow101)\n+\n+### GUI\n+- #17427 Fix missing qRegisterMetaType for `size_t` (hebasto)\n+- #17695 disable File-\\>CreateWallet during startup (fanquake)\n+- #17634 Fix comparison function signature (hebasto)\n+- #18062 Fix unintialized WalletView::progressDialog (promag)\n+\n+### Tests and QA\n+- #17416 Appveyor improvement - text file for vcpkg package list (sipsorcery)\n+- #17488 fix \"bitcoind already running\" warnings on macOS (fanquake)\n+- #17980 add missing #include to fix compiler errors (kallewoof)\n+\n+### Platform support\n+- #17736 Update msvc build for Visual Studio 2019 v16.4 (sipsorcery)\n+- #17364 Updates to appveyor config for VS2019 and Qt5.9.8 + msvc project fixes (sipsorcery)\n+- #17887 bug-fix macos: give free bytes to `F_PREALLOCATE` (kallewoof)\n+\n+### Miscellaneous\n+- #17897 init: Stop indexes on shutdown after ChainStateFlushed callback (jimpo)\n+- #17450 util: Add missing headers to util/fees.cpp (hebasto)\n+- #17654 Unbreak build with Boost 1.72.0 (jbeich)\n+- #17857 scripts: Fix symbol-check & security-check argument passing (fanquake)\n+- #17762 Log to net category for exceptions in ProcessMessages (laanwj)\n+- #18100 Update univalue subtree (MarcoFalke)\n+\n+Credits\n+=======\n+\n+Thanks to everyone who directly contributed to this release:\n+\n+- Aaron Clauson\n+- Adam Jonas\n+- Andrew Chow\n+- Fabian Jahr\n+- fanquake\n+- Gregory Sanders\n+- Harris\n+- Hennadii Stepanov\n+- Jan Beich\n+- Jim Posen\n+- Jo\u00e3o Barbosa\n+- Karl-Johan Alm\n+- Luke Dashjr\n+- MarcoFalke\n+- Michael Chrostowski\n+- Russell Yanofsky\n+- Wladimir J. van der Laan\n+\n+As well as to everyone that helped with translations on\n+[Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/)."
