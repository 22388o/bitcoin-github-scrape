gkrizek,2019-01-18T04:55:37Z,Just to make a note: This was pretty hard to find because it seems the `travis_wait` command in CI doesn't print the output of the script it's calling. At least not stderr.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15196#issuecomment-455427614,455427614,

gkrizek,2019-01-18T15:50:37Z,"@practicalswift That's a good question and I tried to think about that as I fixed this. Ultimately, I think this is a pretty far off edge case. We should not be downgrading our Python version in CI very often at all (only upgrading obviously). So to take the time to write tests to check for features that aren't available in the running Python version is a waste of time I think because it happens s",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15196#issuecomment-455592212,455592212,

gkrizek,2019-01-18T16:52:27Z,"Talked with someone at Travis and the reason it doesn't output the logs is because we see `errexit` on the script. So it exits as soon as a command fails and doesn't get a chance to output the log. \n\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/.travis.yml#L53\n\nWe could stop using `travis_wait` and execute the `verify-commits.py` script directly.
