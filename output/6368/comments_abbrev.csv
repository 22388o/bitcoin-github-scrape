petertodd,2015-07-03T22:54:08Z,"Seems that this test is nearly identical to the one at https://github.com/eordano/bitcoin/blob/test/cltv/src/test/data/tx_invalid.json#L160, other than being in the scriptSig vs. scriptPubKey, and using 1 as the threshold rather than 0. Is that correct, or am I misunderstanding something?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6368#discussion_r33882573,33882573,src/test/data/tx_invalid.json
petertodd,2015-07-03T22:56:01Z,"Duplicate of https://github.com/eordano/bitcoin/blob/test/cltv/src/test/data/tx_invalid.json#L139, but triggered in the scriptSig instead of scriptPubKey. How about you move this test to be next to that one to keep the similar testcases together?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6368#discussion_r33882598,33882598,src/test/data/tx_invalid.json
petertodd,2015-07-03T22:58:41Z,"Again, lets move this to be next to https://github.com/eordano/bitcoin/blob/test/cltv/src/test/data/tx_invalid.json#L151 to keep the similar tests together. Very good idea to test this one though with both scriptPubKey and scriptSig versions! Come to think of it, adding a version that's in a redeemScript as well it wouldn't be a bad idea.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6368#discussion_r33882648,33882648,src/test/data/tx_invalid.json
