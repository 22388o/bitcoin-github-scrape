    "body": "@btcdrak To hide all consensus rule changes activation code in one place and also create GetFlags() as a function candidate to be exposed in libconsensus alongside VerifyScript(). Another option would be to put that code in a deployments module that depends on versionbits similar to what @CodeShark attempted in the past. Yet another option would be to put it in header_verify.cpp (see #8337 ). But if we want to expose GetFlags() in libconsensus, it simply can't stay in main.cpp. I'm happy to hear other suggestions.\n\n@NicolasDorier Sounds like a plan. I'm also happy to put together a PR with the commits we both like so that we can have that as a more stable common base. But for doing that I need to know which commits do you like. It would be also helpful for me to know what you don't like about the ones you don't like, since that may allow me to fix them. Or maybe I can explain the motivation for the things you don't like.\n",
