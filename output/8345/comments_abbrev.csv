Another option would be to put that code in a deployments module that depends on versionbits similar to what @CodeShark attempted in the past. Yet another option would be to put it in header_verify.cpp (see #8337 ). But ,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8345#issuecomment-233140018,233140018,
