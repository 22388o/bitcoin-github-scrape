laanwj,2014-04-14T06:04:27Z,Is the arch still x86_64 in case of x32? Wouldn't this possibly cause the detection process to confuse 64-bit and x32 libs?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4032#discussion_r11572097,11572097,src/m4/ax_boost_base.m4
luke-jr,2014-04-14T06:21:45Z,x86_64-pc-linux-gnux32\n\nThis code is already very confused if there are x86_64 libs installed on a x86_32 OS with x86_64 kernel.
