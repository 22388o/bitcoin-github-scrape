    "body": "> As I2P support hasn't even been released yet, it's much simpler and safer not to insert I2P addresses where port! = 0.\r\n\r\nThe thing is that I2P does support ports other than 0, just not in the currently used SAM proxy version (3.1). But there is no reason future versions of bitcoin core, or other clients, couldn't support I2P with ports. So I'm kind of divided on ignoring them completely, as that will give problems with such addresses not propagating later.

I am a little bit inclined to leave I2P ports as they are, now that ResetI2PPorts() has been removed.\r\n\r\nI haven't been following the I2P work closely, but I really don't understand the motivation for adding code to addrman in #22112. There are only a handful of people using (pre-release) I2P support, so why was code added to master to patch their addrmans if the intention was to remove that code before release?\r\n\r\nI don't understand why we'd want to keep I2P addresses in addrman before bitcoind supports them. With the original version of this PR, it would have been easy to implement that - as soon as bitcoind supports non-port-0 I2P addresses, just remove the line from `IsValidForAddrman()` that disallows them.\r\n\r\nIn any case, #22497 was opened shortly after this PR and quickly merged, removing all of the I2P-specific code from addrman, so I've dropped the first commit.\r\n\r\n> This PR seems to be complicating the already complicated Unserialize().

Currently, addresses are deserialized from peers.dat, added into buckets, and then removed if they're invalid. It's much simpler to just not add them into those buckets if they're invalid.",
