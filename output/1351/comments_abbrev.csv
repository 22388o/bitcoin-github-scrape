It would be better to get rid of usage of strncasecmp all together and use boost's case-insensitive string support.\n\nE.g.\n    -        if (strlen(argv[i]) > 7 && strncasecmp(argv[i], ""bitcoin:"", 8) == 0)\n    +        if (boost::algorithm::istarts_with(argv[i], ""bitcoin:""))\n\nistarts_with is in  boost/algorithm/string/predicate.hpp \n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1351#issuecomment-5801603,5801603,

gavinandresen,2012-05-19T23:16:49Z,"RE: ""massive boost usage"" :\n\nI'm all for making the code clearer and more cross-platform, and we're dependent on boost anyway. The string algorithms are nice little self-contained pieces of functionality.\n\nBut I'm on the fence for changes like sipa's pull request that uses boost::variant for bitcoin addresses (and requires writing little visitor classes to do simple things). I think template m",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1351#issuecomment-5805496,5805496,
laanwj,2012-05-20T08:15:57Z,"_creates cryptic compiler messages, etc._\n\nOne nitpick: you could use clang. In contrary to gcc, it has wonderfully clear error messages, even with template metaprogramming. Also it compiles much faster.\n\nBut I agree that usage of boost should improve readability, not decrease it. \n\nAnd compile-time work is great for time-sensitive inner loops that need to be optimized for specific cases, bu",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1351#issuecomment-5807274,5807274,
