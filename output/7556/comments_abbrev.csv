jtimon,2016-02-26T17:30:51Z,"I still disagree that storing the last sizelimit passed to CTxMemPool::TrimToSize() are the right semantics. It strikes me as hackish, unclean and not very reusable.\nI would prefer any of the multiple solutions I offered in #7115. But at that point none of the solutions were acceptable to you, in fact, you were strongly opposed to https://github.com/morcos/bitcoin/commit/cf95aa1225df59139c774ca98",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7556#issuecomment-189383217,189383217,
morcos,2016-02-26T18:26:57Z,"@jtimon Actually the only piece of this I care about is the first commit, storing the sizeLimit in TrimToSize and not having to pass it into GetMinFee.  In my opinion that is the design of the code:\n- The mempool is limited (there is no reason for that limit to be static).  \n- The size of that limit is set with TrimToSize.

jtimon,2016-02-26T19:59:55Z,"> The mempool is limited (there is no reason for that limit to be static).\n\nTrue, but is currently static. Are there any plans to make it dynamic? Can you share more about that?\n\n> The size of that limit is set with TrimToSize. (unchanged in this PR)\n\nNo, before this PR, it is set in `GetArg(""-maxmempool"", DEFAULT_MAX_MEMPOOL_SIZE)`, not in TrimToSize (apart from the unittests).

morcos,2016-02-26T20:38:35Z,@jtimon I don't mean to be difficult but I would like to get a8261ae merged.  Will it be easier for me to achieve that if I keep your commits in this PR or if I remove them?  I am indifferent.  I'll add the commenting you suggest either way.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7556#issuecomment-189474952,189474952,
