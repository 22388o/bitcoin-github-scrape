And now we have the same problem that you report but in the right column .\n\nI haven't mastered the art of showing only little information on a page without it seeming empty either, but these kind of incremental changes don't improve it in my eyes. Overview page needs a radical redesign, maybe for 1.0.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3507#issuecomment-32090491,32090491,
cozz,2014-01-11T16:06:36Z,"Yes I agree, I think this is mostly a question of what you are used to. And if it looks different\nyou first thought is ""this looks weird"". Updated the pull req again.
