laanwj,2014-12-13T09:00:17Z,"I didn't do this yet because people are reading the documentation on github, and having `doc/remove_bootstrap.md` still be there in the default branch is mildly useful as long as `0.9.x` is still most common. But tagging for 0.11 is OK. By that time I assume parallel block download is commonly used and bootstrapping is, for most purposes, a thing of the past.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5469#issuecomment-66870098,66870098,
