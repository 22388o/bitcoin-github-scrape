sipa,2013-04-30T19:37:38Z,"Winsock 2.2 was released in 1996, and doesn't seem to have changed much. I doubt the version will change much still. The API specifies that if you request a lower version than the latest one supported, you still get the one you requested. So it shouldn't matter much, but it should be safe.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2598#issuecomment-17249432,17249432,

Diapolo,2013-05-02T20:45:00Z,"@sipa I'm not sure if I understand your comment.\nFor -maxreceivebuffer=<n> we have `Maximum per-connection receive buffer, <n>*1000 bytes (default: 5000)` for example, which seems to be the same format as above?\n\nPerhaps negative should be replaced via `<0 = leave <n> CPUs free`...\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2598#discussion_r4063595,4063595,src/init.cpp

Diapolo,2013-05-03T17:17:36Z,"I don't get it (string wise)... do you consider `-n` in that case as ""minus n"" or ""dash n""?\nAnyway ^^, is `<0 = leave <-n> CPUs free` okay then, so I can update?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2598#discussion_r4077446,4077446,src/init.cpp
sipa,2013-05-03T17:27:30Z,"Minus n. If n is negative, -n is positive, and -n is how many cores we'll leave free.
