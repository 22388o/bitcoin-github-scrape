ken2812221,2018-09-16T23:45:23Z,NACK. I don't think this is worth doing this. It's only 19 lines.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14159#issuecomment-421854579,421854579,
practicalswift,2018-09-17T05:59:40Z,@ken2812221 The problem with the 19 lines is not only the number of lines but the fact that it looks like a lot of errors occurred when everything worked as expected :-)  That is poor usability.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14159#issuecomment-421896683,421896683,
ken2812221,2018-09-17T06:24:50Z,"@practicalswift In my opinion, I would prefer folding them instead of hiding them. This would make it less noise, too. If I want to know additional information, I can unfold them.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14159#issuecomment-421901075,421901075,
scravy,2018-09-19T10:01:14Z,"I like it a lot better how it is present in this PR. These lines are never relevant and they actually do look like errors. If the subtree check actually fails it will still print the failure. If it doesn't, then it's not of interest as it passed.\n\nI do think any linter/check should not say anything unless it actually found a problem.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14159#issuecomment-422737763,422737763,

MarcoFalke,2018-09-19T15:20:33Z,"My intention was to always print the results, so that errors in the script could be detected.\n\nI think a better solution would be to append the following lines to each script:\n\n```py\nexit_with_error = errors > 0 or len(args_need_doc) or whatever\nprint('ERROR' if exit_with_error else 'GOOD')\nprint()\n```\n\nThis way, the output is preserved, but it is also easy to spot an error\ns",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14159#discussion_r218848056,218848056,test/lint/check-doc.py

MarcoFalke,2018-09-19T16:04:06Z,"A zero exit code does not prove the script is not erroneous.

practicalswift,2018-09-21T15:00:01Z,@MarcoFalke I'm not sure I follow TBH. What conditions do you want to print and/or error on in `check-doc.py`?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14159#discussion_r219527848,219527848,test/lint/check-doc.py
