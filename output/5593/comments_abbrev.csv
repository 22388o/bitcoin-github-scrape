fanquake,2015-01-04T09:51:44Z,I can't find any difference with or without --interactive. What actually happens when you run the install command?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5593#issuecomment-68627218,68627218,
chulini,2015-01-04T21:03:58Z,The first time I installed berkeley-db4 the installation sent me to the regular console. Googling I've figured out that --interactive forces the interactive mode at the end of installation. Tried again with --interactive and that worked fine.\n\nNow I've uninstalled berkeley-db4 an installed again **without** --interactive flag and sent me to the interactive mode just like with --interactive flag.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5593#issuecomment-68648908,68648908,
