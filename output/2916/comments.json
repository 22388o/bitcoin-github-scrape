Only volumes formatted with the Mac OS Extended file system fully support Mac OS X\u2013style resource forks, data forks, file flags, and extended attributes. Third-party software has been developed for Windows-based operating systems to allow them to access the extended metadata features of Mac OS Extended. More often, though, users will use the compatibility software built into Lion to help other file systems cope with these metadata items.\n\nFor most non-Mac OS volumes, Lion stores the file system metadata in a separate hidden data file. This technique is commonly referred to as AppleDouble. For example, if you copy a file containing metadata named \u201cMy Document.docx\u201d to a FAT32 volume, Lion will automatically split the file and write it as two discrete pieces on the FAT32 volume. The file\u2019s internal data would be written with the same name as the original, but the metadata would end up in a file named ._My Document.docx that would remain hidden from the Finder. This works out pretty well for most files because Windows applications only care about the contents of the data fork. But, some files do not take well to being split up, and all the extra dot-underscore files create a bit of a mess on other file systems.\n",
