jonasschnelli,2015-05-08T09:57:38Z,Added another commit on top.\n\nThis would decouple the wallet from the core and would allow to have multiple wallets (validation devices) over signaling.\n\nTogether with https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5994 it would basically remove (almost) all wallet #ifdefs. The goal is to just have one wallet #ifdef at the point where we register for signals.\n\nIMO this is a massiv step forward of c,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5990#issuecomment-100178912,100178912,
