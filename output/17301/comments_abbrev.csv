Any open issues for this?\n\nYes, the reason the RPC server has always been disabled for the GUI by default is that it's not necessary for most GUI users, so it reduces the attack surface without any adverse consequences.\n\nIf new developments cause it to be more necessary, this can be reconsidered, of course.\n\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17301#issuecomment-547582065,547582065,
jonasschnelli,2019-10-30 06:22:29,"I guess most GUI users don't use the RPC interface and it's unclear to me if it is worth to enable it by default for better integration with HWI/junction.\n\nThough better GUI integration **to enable the RPC interface** would be desirable IMO.

laanwj,2019-10-30 08:58:47,"W.r.t. security, some of the trade-offs are non-obvious: for example it's mostly GUI users that tend to run the software on the same computer as a browser.\n\nAs long as the RPC is reachable through localhost TCP (and not something off-limits to browsers like a UNIX socket), with RPC enabled there is the increased risk that malware running in the browser (with or without the aid of a partial san",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17301#issuecomment-547800410,547800410,
