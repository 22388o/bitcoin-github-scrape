fanquake,2019-10-04 19:17:11,This has been opened against the wrong branch (master instead of 0.18).,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17054#issuecomment-538527292,538527292,
fanquake,2019-10-04 19:26:28,"Actually, if you wanted to change this to be against the `0.19` branch, I'll add the commit to #16617 for backporting to `0.18` once it's been merged into master.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17054#issuecomment-538530325,538530325,
lucayepa,2019-10-04 19:29:29,Yes. I open a new one for the backport to 0.19 branch: #17055,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17054#issuecomment-538531205,538531205,
lucayepa,2019-10-04 22:25:22,I guess cheks need to be run again.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17054#issuecomment-538579438,538579438,
laanwj,2019-10-05 09:57:49,"Thanks! But FWIW: If it's a clean backport, you don't need to open a separate PR for every branch, clean-backportable PRs that are marked for backport, will be collected into ""backport PRs"" by developers (like #16617) before a new release on that branch.\n\nEdit: also, it makes sense to do the backport *after* merge to master to make sure it includes all the last changes.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17054#issuecomment-538635658,538635658,
lucayepa,2019-10-05 13:19:40,"Sure. I've seen the ""needs backport"" tags and I thought it was addressed to me. Thanks.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17054#issuecomment-538649189,538649189,
fanquake,2019-10-24 15:07:45,I don't think we need three PR open for the same change at the same time. I'm going to close this are pull the 0.18 backport into #16617 if this change gets merged into master.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17054#issuecomment-545962997,545962997,
lucayepa,2019-10-24 17:20:10,Agree. It's my fault...,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17054#issuecomment-546017884,546017884,
