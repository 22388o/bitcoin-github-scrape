jgarzik,2011-05-03T14:01:24Z,"This is a recent rough draft, but it needs improvement.\n\nThink about the object structure a bit.  You want a ""CAddress factory"", that will create one or more CAddress's from a DNS lookup.  Supporting a multiple-address lookup from _inside_ a singleton address object is awkward, because DNS lookups have a one-to-many relationship between DNS names and addresses.\n\nThe ""create higher nIndex, unti",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/192#issuecomment-1093984,1093984,
sipa,2011-05-04T11:21:52Z,"I agree, actually. I moved the lookup code to a NameLookup function that creates a CAddress or a vector of those, and is used in the (single-address only) lookup version of the CAddress constructor, for convenience.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/192#issuecomment-1099269,1099269,

Satoshi reserved space for it in the P2P protocol address storage area, and it will be needed in years to come, to connect some clients.\n\nAs such, please separate hostname and port into two distinct function parameters / variables, and do not combine them into",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/192#issuecomment-1110871,1110871,
sipa,2011-05-06T11:56:47Z,"I actually started writing this patch by using getaddrinfo, since its interface is much cleaner and supports seamless upgrading to IPv6. Not knowing what the compatibility of that is with other operating systems, i sticked to gethostbyname.\n\nConsidering IPv6 hostnames, I would suggest first trying to parse the string passed as [host]:port, and if this parsing fails, resort to host:port.
