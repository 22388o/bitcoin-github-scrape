gavinandresen,2012-02-25T21:26:42Z,I'd really prefer that new JSON-RPC methods get discussed on bitcoin-development before turning into pull requests.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/895#issuecomment-4176302,4176302,
jgarzik,2012-05-08T23:12:40Z,"Agreed.  Closing -- please propose new JSON-RPC methods on bitcoin-devel.  It definitely helps gauge acceptance and interest, as well as more fully specifying protocol and intent.  ""There has been some interest"" without URL references could mean anything, or nothing.\n\nIn particular, does the mining community want these RPCs, in this form?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/895#issuecomment-5589064,5589064,
