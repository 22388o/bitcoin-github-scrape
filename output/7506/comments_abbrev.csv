jonasschnelli,2016-02-19T16:21:06Z,Do I understand this correctly: this only make sense if you use the GUI (CoinControl enabled) and `fundrawtransaction` (over RPC with the -server option or over the GUI console)?\n\nAlthough looking at this PR from an angle where CCoinControl is a core-class (not tied to the GUI) I think this would make sense.\n\nWhat real-world use cases would solve this?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7506#issuecomment-186284838,186284838,

jonasschnelli,2016-02-20T08:10:16Z,"@promag: yes. I saw that this only affects fundrawtransaction. But IIRC, CoinControl can only be used over the GUI. So does that mean, that this change only affects users who uses the GUI together with fundrawtransaction (console/RPC)?\nWhat usecases would be possible with this change?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7506#issuecomment-186541303,186541303,

laanwj,2016-02-17T09:11:29Z,"Is the old and new code equivalent here? \nTo me it looks like `coinControl.IsSelected` and the old code check for different things: IsSelected checks `coincontrol.setSelected`, whereas the old code just looks at `wtx` and `tx`.\nCan you explain?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7506#discussion_r53137093,53137093,src/wallet/wallet.cpp
promag,2016-02-17T09:33:04Z,"Yes they are. The only difference is that the old code performs a linear search and reimplements the `COutPoint::operator==` inline.\n\n`coinControl.setSelected` is filled with the current inputs, which are the ones to search when the inputs are added, otherwise the same input would be duplicated.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7506#discussion_r53139277,53139277,src/wallet/wallet.cpp
