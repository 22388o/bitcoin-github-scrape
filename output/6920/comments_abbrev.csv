paveljanik,2015-10-31T10:36:38Z,You can ping-pong this include between in `.cpp` and `.h` or have them in both. But who cares? Do we have a recommendation for developers?\n\nThis and all similar issues are a form of DoS on Bitcoin Core development IMO.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6920#issuecomment-152721614,152721614,

laanwj,2015-10-31T11:05:14Z,"> This and all similar issues are a form of DoS on Bitcoin Core development IMO.\n\nAgree. NACK, closing.\n\nEdit: To be clear, I'm with changes like this if they actually break unneeded dependencies.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6920#issuecomment-152723695,152723695,

sipa,2015-10-31T15:08:56Z,"@paveljanik The intention is that every file #includes all headers which it\nuses things from, even if that dependency was already indirectly #included\nthrough one of its other dependencies.\n\nA .c file's corresponding .h file is an exception, as they are considered\nto be one unit. #includes in the .h file do not need to be repeated in the\n.c file in that case.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6920#issuecomment-152741641,152741641,

But there's nothing wrong with including a dependency headet in both the .h and .c. Compilers will remember which files were already include",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6920#issuecomment-152746566,152746566,
