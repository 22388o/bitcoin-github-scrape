achow101,2017-09-12T13:41:29Z,"Instead of moving the code block up, couldn't this just be made an `if` instead of `else if`? If we want to show this error before doing any of the wallet creating stuff, this entire check could just be moved to before the first run block.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11307#discussion_r138350732,138350732,src/wallet/wallet.cpp
MarcoFalke,2017-09-12T14:29:16Z,"Yes, the else can be removed for better clarity. However, I'd still prefer that the new-non-hd-error is guarded by first-run. This way we can return early and don't have to deal with `TopUpKeyPool`, which might take a ""long"" time...\n\nI don't think this whole check can be moved to before the first run block, as `IsHDEnabled` should be called after (a potential) `SetHDMasterKey`.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11307#discussion_r138364782,138364782,src/wallet/wallet.cpp

achow101,2017-09-12T22:57:55Z,"I believe it is, but that is not a problem since the program just exits here. The same behavior happens earlier too with other `InitError`s.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11307#discussion_r138487741,138487741,src/wallet/wallet.cpp
