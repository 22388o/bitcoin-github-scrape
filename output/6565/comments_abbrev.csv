theuni,2015-08-20T20:37:11Z,boost::reverse_lock is new as of 1.50 :(\n\nWe either need to set that as the minimum version required or work out a different fix here.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6565#issuecomment-133163448,133163448,
casey,2015-08-20T21:05:12Z,"The reverse lock implementation is very simple. If we can't bump the minimum required boost version to 1.50, I could copy pasta it in.\n\nAlternatively we could just go back to the first implementation, which, although ugly, works fine.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6565#issuecomment-133172556,133172556,

jonasschnelli,2015-08-30T08:12:26Z,Also ran into the same problem like @pstratem. I solved it with a dist upgrade to jessie... which is somehow not ideal.
