Instead the locally scoped\nvariable lastDate was updated.\n\nThis resulted in self.lastDate being kept constant at its initial\nvalue datetime.datetime(2000, 1, 1) during the lifetime of the\nBlockDataCopier object, which in turn meant that the check ...\n\n    if self.timestampSplit and (blkDate > self.lastDate):\n\n... was effectively reduced to ...\n\n    if self.timestampSplit:\n\n... since self.lastDate was stuck at 2000-01-01.",
