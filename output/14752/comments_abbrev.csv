dongcarl,2018-11-28T08:31:10Z,"I might be missing something but the two `BOOST_CHECK`s here seem to be testing `IsPayToWitnessScriptHash()` on identical `CScript`s.

dongcarl,2018-11-28T08:37:47Z,"It's a little unclear why the construction of the `CScript` here is different from the other two `CHECK`s in the same test, does this change in construction test the correctness of `IsExpectedWitnessProgram` in any way?

domob1812,2018-11-28T13:14:14Z,"The main reason why I added the second version here is because that code is used later for constructing the ""invalid"" ones as well (basically so that we would likely notice if the construction itself is wrong and the other tests invalid).

domob1812,2018-11-28T13:16:39Z,"I added this for the same reason as with the other comment above - to make sure that code constructing a script ""this way"" yields a valid witness program as well, while very similar code in later tests with slight modifications yields an invalid program.
