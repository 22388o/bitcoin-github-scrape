gavinandresen,2012-10-05T18:01:32Z,ACK.  Will this break translations?  So should it wait until after 0.7.1 ?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1911#issuecomment-9184357,9184357,
laanwj,2012-10-05T18:23:31Z,"Yes, this will break translations. \n\nBTW how do you get signed/unsigned warnings for printf? Normally it only barks on data type width mismatches.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1911#issuecomment-9185000,9185000,
Diapolo,2012-10-05T19:41:38Z," Yes the wording of the pull is misleading, it should read ""fix wrong (signed/unsigned) printf format specifier in bitcoinrpc.cpp"", sorry. Should be merged after 0.7.1.\n\nEdit: Updated to clarify commit message!\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1911#issuecomment-9187359,9187359,
