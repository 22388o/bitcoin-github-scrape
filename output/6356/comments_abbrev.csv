laanwj,2015-07-27T09:09:04Z,"A small nit: this puts the pruning operation under the init message `Loading Wallet`, and also under `Step 8: load wallet` in the source code - while it has nothing to do with the wallet.\nAs this can take a while, and also to keep clear separation, it may be better to add an InitMessage call on top and put it in its own logical step.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6356#issuecomment-125136808,125136808,
ajweiss,2015-07-27T17:56:41Z,"SGTM.  I lean towards something a little more generic like ""Performing data directory maintenance..."" as opposed to ""Pruning blockstore..."" as it would allow for other similar data directory management tasks to be added in future without creating more translation work.  Although, the others aren't as generic.  Do you have a preference?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6356#issuecomment-125287331,125287331,
ajweiss,2015-07-29T18:03:50Z,"Ok, pushed.  I used ""Pruning blockstore..."" for now as it's more in line with the descriptiveness of the other init messages.  If there's objection, I can change it to something more generic.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6356#issuecomment-126042889,126042889,
laanwj,2015-08-03T17:21:06Z,"@ajweiss Agreed that a more general categorization is a good idea, also to make localization easier. But yes at the moment the messages are very specific, so this is most consistent. \n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6356#issuecomment-127336282,127336282,
