sdaftuar,2015-04-09T20:05:46Z,"@sipa  I thought you raised a good point about ignoring blocks requested after a given one, so I've pushed up a commit that does so (for block requests going to the same peer).\n\nI am not entirely sure the additional 5 lines of code (and one extra piece of state for each peer) is worth the code complexity, so if you prefer the first version I can drop this commit, but it seemed unfortunate that i",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5976#issuecomment-91342855,91342855,

sdaftuar,2015-04-13T17:39:23Z,"Thanks for catching that; it was intentional to not use it anymore but it was an oversight not to remove the unnecessary variable from QueuedBlock.
