    "body": "@MarcoFalke Good question.  I'm not sure what the motivation is behind the `BlockAssembler` class and its design.  Outside of tests, it's only ever used in `getblocktemplate` and `generateBlocks` in `rpc/mining.cpp`.  It is always created as an ephemeral object on the stack and then after it is done creating a `CBlockTemplate`, it is immediately destroyed after the stack frame ends. \r\n\r\nWhy it allocates a `CBlockTemplate` as a pointer and then returns it via a `unique_ptr` is a good question.  I guess because a block template is potentially very \"heavy\" and the people designing the subsystem didn't want to mess with `std::move` and/or rvalue reference `&&` semantics, and `unique_ptr` is just easier to think about for some people?  Or maybe this evolved from some older code that did it with raw pointers?  I don't know...  If I had done it perhaps I would have just used a `CBlockTemplate` and ensured it had proper `std::move` semantics and returned it directly by value, leveraging RVO and `&&` move semantics.\r\n",

    "body": "Yeah that was the pre-C++11 canonical way to do it.  Also just returning the value was pretty much always guaranteed to not produce any copies and be equivalent to the \"pass down a non-const ref\" way..  (RVO/copy elision basically does that for you internally anyway).  \r\n\r\nThe example you show is the cheapest way (as is a proper RVO return by value), for sure.  Move semantics are \"almost free\" too -- you just have to pay the extra cost of swapping pointers, etc (CBlockTemplate's heaviest members are the vector of tx refs and other stuff and so you pay the cost of that pointer swap...).\r\n\r\n> What I meant is that simply removing nullptr checks is scary and will also fail to compile\r\n\r\n:) It is only scary if you are thinking about it as just a fancy `malloc`. In C, definitely, not checking `NULL` is scary.  \r\n\r\nHowever, in C++, `new` can never return `nullptr` (at least not the  `new` used in this entire codebase).  It's guaranteed to throw or succeed.  Those are its only two postconditions.  In light of that, there are no sanitizers or compilers that will error out on it or  complain -- since the standard in C++  specifies exactly what new does...\r\n \r\nIf you find this PR useless or scary, feel free to close it.  I figured rather than complain I could help out and fix the little nits here and there.\r\n\r\nNo worries either way.\r\n",

    "body": "No static analyzer or compiler expects you to check every single pointer you get given or receive as a return value.  Having such a strict requirement would mean your code would be riddled with boilerplate checks everywhere.  (instead, at best, some static analyzers sometimes use heuristics to warn you about obviously bad usages).\r\n\r\nJust to reiterate -- code like this:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nauto ptr = std::make_unique<MyClass>(arg1, arg2);\r\nif (!ptr)\r\n  // handle error here\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs unidiomatic and kind of silly... since it can never be false.  For that reason no static analyzer that I know of expects you to check `unique_ptr` return value either.  \r\n\r\nBackground: Usually static analyzers do not expect you to check for NULL for every single pointer return type you use.  Doing so would be boilerplate city.  They usually expect you to check for NULL before using only if the  analyzer concludes (based on heuristics) that the pointer may be NULL sometimes.  For example, if you later check for NULL in the function -- this indicates to the analyzer that you expect it to be NULL sometimes. If it cannot conclude that the pointer may be NULL, it will not complain.  ",
