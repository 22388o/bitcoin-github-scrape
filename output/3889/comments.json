We already break during the actual sending of block data when the output buffer is full.\n\nOnce we have actual parallel downloading and smarter selection of peers, throttling won't hurt peers as much anymore, as they can switch to faster ones. When that is the case, an actual -throttleupload option or something seems fine to me, and far superior to this.\n\nAlso, this option will lose its meaning when headers-first is implemented, as it will use getheaders instead of getblocks.\n",

    "body": "@hno You may have misunderstood me. As long as we don't have parallel block downloading, I think that any throttling of peers downloading from you hurts both more than it helps.\n\nAs it's unclear when we'll have parallel downloading, maybe a temporarily solution is detecting when you're over some user-configurable limit, and after that stop serving blocks to new peers (i.e., just disconnect them, so you lose the bandwidth, and they can go find a better peer to download from).\n",
