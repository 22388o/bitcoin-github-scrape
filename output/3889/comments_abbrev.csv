rebroad,2014-03-17T06:50:39Z,"I think there is more than one change here, since you're also changing the default from 500 to 200. How about a separate pull for that? (although, rather than change the default to a fixed number, I think it would make more sense that this adapts based upon the block sizes - for example, the earlier blocks were very small, and so 500 was a suitable number to request in one go).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3889#issuecomment-37788829,37788829,

sipa,2014-03-31T09:24:28Z,"Unsure about this.\n\nRight now, any throttling solution will just hurt the one downloading from you, and I doubt you'll notice the difference (that's a guess; I would like to hear evidence otherwise). We already break during the actual sending of block data when the output buffer is full.\n\nOnce we have actual parallel downloading and smarter selection of peers, throttling won't hurt peers as mu",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3889#issuecomment-39069000,39069000,
laanwj,2014-03-31T09:39:04Z,"Good point @sipa.

hno,2014-04-15T09:02:57Z,The purpose of this was to throttle the ones downloading from you.\n\nIt was tested successfully on a slow Internet connection. Without limiting to a smaller size the peers requesting chain download easily overloaded the connection. With limiting the bandwidth usage was under control and it could continue to service both bitcoin and other uses.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3889#issuecomment-40459833,40459833,

sipa,2014-04-15T10:09:41Z,"@hno You may have misunderstood me. As long as we don't have parallel block downloading, I think that any throttling of peers downloading from you hurts both more than it helps.\n\nAs it's unclear when we'll have parallel downloading, maybe a temporarily solution is detecting when you're over some user-configurable limit, and after that stop serving blocks to new peers (i.e., just disconnect them,",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3889#issuecomment-40465271,40465271,
