kazcw,2016-10-28T21:23:22Z,"Minor edge case: a non-fatal error in FlushState (currently only low disk space) would override a MODE_INVALID, preventing misbehavior accounting and reject messages for the current tx. Since MODE_ERROR from FlushState is ignored in this case anyway, I think it'd be more robust to give FlushState a dummy CValidationState.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8969#discussion_r85612690,85612690,src/main.cpp
