gmaxwell,2016-11-26T22:45:24Z,Hardcoding it is wrong for systems other than windows.  If it's missing on OpenBSD it may be necessary to add another header.  select.h would be an obvious candidate.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9224#issuecomment-263090494,263090494,
luke-jr,2016-11-26T23:35:45Z,"FD_SETSIZE has historically been able to be overridden on most systems, but unfortunately IIRC some years ago glibc hard-coded it so it cannot be changed. :(",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9224#issuecomment-263092505,263092505,
laanwj,2016-11-28T07:09:38Z,"ACK after squash. Adding a header is the right thing to do.\n\nI wonder why you need this though, I have built many times on OpenBSD (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/build-openbsd.md) without stumbling on this issue.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9224#issuecomment-263198424,263198424,
ivdsangen,2016-11-28T16:57:32Z,I started using OpenBSD again after some time. I upgraded to -current and followed the instructions in build-openbsd.md and got the error that FD_SETSIZE was undeclared.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9224#issuecomment-263327033,263327033,
