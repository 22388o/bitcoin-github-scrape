laanwj,2013-12-10T12:01:36Z,"ACK -- we must make sure though that no one will ever call LogPrint before mapMultiArgs has its final state, to avoid different threads ending up with different values. Neither ReadConfigFile nor ParseParameters calls LogPrint (and neither does any of the supporting code, it appears) so right now it is safe.\nIn any case this is better than a crash.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3377#discussion_r8229613,8229613,src/util.cpp
