Sjors,2020-06-08 10:46:48,This exception was strange to begin with. But I don't think it has anything to do with `download` permission. Maybe keep it `noban`?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19191#discussion_r436608386,436608386,src/net_processing.cpp

MarcoFalke,2020-06-08 11:44:18,"Why is is strange? The literal motivation for this is that nodes with this permission can use us ""as a block source"" (#6974).\n\nImagine you spin up an archival node, disconnect it from the network, but make it available in you internal network. Nodes with the download permission should be able to use your archival node as a block source, no?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19191#discussion_r436634375,436634375,src/net_processing.cpp
Sjors,2020-06-08 17:09:22,"Ah, that PR explains the problem. Even nodes that are almost synced can be `IsInitialBlockDownload()`, presumably also nodes that have been disconnected for a few days?
