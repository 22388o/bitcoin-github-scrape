Just by equaling it I would be more than happy to close #10227, but it occurs to me that I didn't do an exhaustive search on all the functions in validation.o that could be made static (independently on whether they use CChainParams or Consensus::Params or not). If you do that, I bet not only nobody will complain for increasing the scope of a PR with 3 acks but people will actually praise you (at least I will) for every new function that can be static you find apart from the 3 in #10227.\r\nI think it's also a more interesting and rewarding task than what #7829 proposes alone.\r\n\r\nEDIT: or maybe a separated PR for that makes more sense, I'm not sure\r\n",

You can also use it for squash commits or remove them, I use interactive rebase all the time.\r\n\r\n",

Even better if you also run the unittests by doing \"make check\" (you can use several cores/hyperthreads to build faster with -j4 [example for 4 processes, but depends on you machine]). This PR shouldn't really need it, but you can also run the python tests to be more sure your changes are correct, see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/master/test (and by the way, writing functional tests is a good way to contribute and learn, plus python is easier to learn than C++).\r\n\r\nAt least one of your problems seems to be that you need a forward declaration for CheckInputs, but there may be more and you should be able to easily find them and fix them with the help of the compiler.\r\nI'm also jtimon on IRC freenode if you want to ask me questions there too, maybe in #bitcoin-core-dev too if I'm not around. That may be more convenient and also less disruptive to other reviewers.\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "Although it has been very useful for me to look only at the latest changes you have done to fix the problems separately and it is a nice practice to facilitate reviewers work (ie now I can approve 02cf6e1 independently, without having to re-approve cf8243b which I didn't because it was wrong, but normally it would be just allowing to review the latest changes without re-reviewing anything they have already approved), this PR should not be merged as it is because not all the commits are correct individually.\r\n\r\nEven travis is saying it, but even if we didn't had Continuous Integration, we already figured out that cf8243b is incorrect locally. Please, squash again so that every commit is correct individually. People make mistakes, but it is always better for everyone to rewrite git history before it happens (is merged) than afterwards. Since we always maintain at least 2 major versions simultaneously, having a clean, and ideally always-correct history helps maintaining things.\r\n\r\nYour only reserve for squashing could be invalidating previous approvals, but note that @paveljanik , @dcousens and me only approved 25660e9 , which this PR no longer contains. That's my fault for asking you to increase the scope of the PR, but I really think also turning functions into static will be more interesting for reviewers than just reducing the dependency to the \"Params()\" function, which not everyone cares about. After you squash, another ACK shouldn't take me much time, this looks good as it is for me.\r\n\r\nBut I'm also sorry to tell you, I don't this will be the last time you will have to rebase. Changing the function signature is usually easy to write but often painful to maintain. Maybe not. Some PRs are merged in days, some after months without needing rebase, some need rebase all the time.\r\n\r\nOne way to solve potential future conflicts in advance is by making sure your branch could rebase cleanly (ie without any conflict/modification) on top of all the currently open PRs. That works for small projects, but not for this one, see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls. You can wait, find something taking a look or just be warned: this conflicts with #10192 (in CheckInputs at least) and probably #10279 too, who knows what else.\r\nI see 3 options to advance further:\r\n\r\n1) Don't try to solve conflicts in advance, leave things as they are and rebase things as open conflicts get merged.\r\n2)  Avoid the conflicts by reducing the scope of your own PR.\r\n3) Coordinate with the other PR to share preparation commits at the beginning of both or on another PR with only the common parts.\r\n\r\nI really look for option 3, but 1 and 2 are usually easier.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
