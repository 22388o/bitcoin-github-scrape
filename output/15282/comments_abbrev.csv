MarcoFalke,2019-02-21T14:08:21Z,Sure but there is also [#14691](https://drahtbot.github.io/bitcoin_core_issue_redirect/r/14691.html) (tests: Speedup feature_pruning test and refactor big transaction logic by @conscott) which look promising,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15282#issuecomment-466012177,466012177,

instagibbs,2019-02-13T15:17:31Z,You could take out everything from this hot loop except the `txtouts.append` line to see if we gain back that 0.18 secs?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15282#discussion_r256441143,256441143,test/functional/test_framework/util.py
stevenroose,2019-02-14T12:04:21Z,Strangely enough this made it 0.2 seconds slower on my machine :/ So I think it's better as-is.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15282#discussion_r256804197,256804197,test/functional/test_framework/util.py
