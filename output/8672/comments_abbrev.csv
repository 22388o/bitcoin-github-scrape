We have:\n- Base size\n- Total size (base + witness)\n- Virtual size (base + witness/4)\n- Weight (4*base + witness)\n\nMy assumption was that after segwit, only vsize would matter.

jonasschnelli,2016-09-07T06:42:18Z,"I agree that the virtual size does make more sense to display. We just need to clearly distinct between size (concrete hard size of a data structure) and virtual size (including other variables and attached to a bigger context).\n\nI'm also not opposed to display multiple size types (at least base, total and virtual).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8672#issuecomment-245189617,245189617,
