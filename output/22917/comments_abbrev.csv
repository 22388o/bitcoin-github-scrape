sipsorcery,2021-09-08 18:32:30,Do the Qt exe's need to be copied to src\qt for any paricular reason? Is that where the test scripts look for them? I believe Nicolas originally added the `common.vcxproj` config to copy the exe's to the src directory for conveniece. Perhaps it's sufficient here as well and avoids the need for the new `common.qt.vcxproj` file?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22917#discussion_r704674808,704674808,build_msvc/common.qt.vcxproj
hebasto,2021-09-08 19:08:17,"No test script uses `bitcoin-qt.exe`. The only reason is my confusion:\n\n> Not finding `bitcoin-qt.exe` ... in the `src\qt\` folder could confuse users.\n\nProbably, it is just my biased personal opinion.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22917#discussion_r704698333,704698333,build_msvc/common.qt.vcxproj
sipsorcery,2021-09-08 19:11:59,If the test scripts don't need it in `src\qt` then I would recommend just including `common.vcxproj` and not bothering with the new `common.qt.vcxproj` file. Windows devs will normally look in the default output directory of `build_msvc\x64\Release` directory.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22917#discussion_r704700813,704700813,build_msvc/common.qt.vcxproj
