jonasschnelli,2015-06-05T18:59:31Z,I think only your change in `main.cpp` line 1003 is relevant.\nYou should probably remove all other changes and force-push again.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6240#issuecomment-109398334,109398334,
jonasschnelli,2015-06-05T19:08:22Z,"I think the concept of allowing local wallet `send*` commands to always end up in the memory pool is not a undeliberated idea. It didn't thought it through completely but somehow i agree that local wallet send commands should always end up in the local memory pool.\nSorry for that, but the code is ugly and unusable.\nNACK for the code but idea seems usefull\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6240#issuecomment-109401847,109401847,
laanwj,2015-06-06T07:54:56Z,To make it easier to discuss specific changes. It's better to submit unrelated changes separately:\n- _Transactions submitted by sendrawtransaction rpccall should be always allowed despite this new -relaypriority switch_: this may be slightly controversial - we've always have the implicit policy 'don't send transactions that you wouldn't relay yourself'\n- _Allow duplicate txout address in creater,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6240#issuecomment-109549124,109549124,

jonasschnelli,2015-06-05T18:55:11Z,Why did you change this lines?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6240#discussion_r31841028,31841028,src/netbase.cpp
jonasschnelli,2015-06-05T18:55:34Z,Why did you change netbase.cpp at all?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6240#discussion_r31841058,31841058,src/netbase.cpp
jonasschnelli,2015-06-05T18:55:49Z,Same for this file.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6240#discussion_r31841083,31841083,src/rpcmining.cpp

jonasschnelli,2015-06-06T07:51:35Z,Okay. I see. You are right that the formatting is wrong there. But the diff you create can be hard to read for others. At least it would be good to separate the style changes from the actual code changes. Also i wouldn't care to much about existing inconsistency in code formatting because we could run one `clang-format` over everything (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5387).\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6240#discussion_r31865832,31865832,src/netbase.cpp
jonasschnelli,2015-06-06T07:52:55Z,What is the reason for this? Is this required to achieve your PRs goal or is this another feature that is unrelated to this PR?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6240#discussion_r31865839,31865839,src/util.cpp
