It might cause unwanted bugs if someone refactors the code in the future.\r\n\r\nIt seems that in that case there will also be automatic problems. On IRC yesterday there was a discussion about this, and there are more paths through which it will get into `FlushStateToDisk` with `nManualPruneHeight=0` when manual pruning is enabled. This change would cover only one of them.\r\n\r\nI wrongly assumed that `fCheckForPruning` would always be false when pruning manual. But it can be set, in which case `FlushStateToDisk` will be called from block processing.\r\n\r\nFor 0.15 or later it would be nice to refactor the pruning code. `fCheckForPruning` would be better as an argument of the appropriate functions instead of a global flag (to have a better grasp on when it's set and not set), and the pruning mode `OFF|MANUAL|AUTO` would be better represented as an enum.",
