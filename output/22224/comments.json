    "body": "> Did I understand correctly that there are no difficulties with Qt 5.12.10?\r\n\r\nThe difficulty is not Qt it's the difference between the `msbuild` version on the machine I use to build the Qt binaries and the `msbuild` version in the Appveyor image. The Appveyor `Visual Studio 2019` image is on version `16.9.5` and my machine is on `16.10.1`. \r\n\r\nI did install a separate `msbuild` `16.9.5` toolchain on my machine and while it built `Qt 5.12.11` successfully the Appveyor image got a link error when it attempted to use it. I'm guessing the two `msbuild` installs aren't fully isolated somehow. From past experience these linker issues can take a while to solve and it seems more efficient to simply switch to the Appveyor Preview image.\r\n\r\nFor any devs wanting to use the Qt binaries to build locally it means they will need to update to the latest stable version of `msbuild` `16.10.1`.\r\n\r\nIf there are any concerns I can dig deeper into the `16.9.5` version link issue.",
