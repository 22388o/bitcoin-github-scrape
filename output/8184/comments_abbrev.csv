It would allow us to get rid of some hack in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/qt/macnotificationhandler.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8184#issuecomment-224988684,224988684,
theuni,2016-06-09T20:37:34Z,"@jonasschnelli afaik 10.7 is the pretty standard minimum these days, but we could always bump if desired. It doesn't look like that runtime check really hurts anything, though?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8184#issuecomment-225018710,225018710,

I'd also say stick with 10.7 as minimum for the foreseeable future.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8184#issuecomment-225181904,225181904,
