bedri,2018-02-27T20:48:03Z,Hope I did PR correctly this time. [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) kinda confused me since explanation for upstream repository exists there.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12562#issuecomment-369020526,369020526,
sipa,2018-02-27T20:50:37Z,"Two comments:\n* This is still in the wrong repository. Changes to LevelDB should go to the https://github.com/bitcoin-core/leveldb repository at least, and ideally through https://github.com/google/leveldb. We regularly pull in new versions from those repositories, but don't make local changes here directly.\n* You seem to have added a number of unrelated files to the repository.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12562#issuecomment-369021286,369021286,
eklitzke,2018-02-27T21:12:09Z,I just built upstream LevelDB (at commit 41172a24016bc29fc795ed504737392587f54e3d) and all of these have been fixed there.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12562#issuecomment-369027585,369027585,
