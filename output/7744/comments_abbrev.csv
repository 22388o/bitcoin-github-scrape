laanwj,2016-03-25T16:27:11Z,Should be fixed now. The problem was that start_nodes can fail with part of the nodes already started.\n`wait_bitcoinds` will subsequently wait forever for them to exit (as it uses a global variable to communicate bitcoind_processes).\nOne-to-last commit makes sure that they're stopped properly in that case.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7744#issuecomment-201350446,201350446,
