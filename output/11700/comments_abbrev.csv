jonasschnelli,2017-11-16T06:25:50Z,"We could wait with merging this until we have a couple of signatures from @willyko.\n\nBut every gitian build/sig is valuable... having the keys here in this repository makes things easier to verify and the integrity of the keys is sort-of protected in a signed-data-chain (gitian signatures of the tarbal which includes the keys to verify future versions).",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11700#issuecomment-344828294,344828294,
