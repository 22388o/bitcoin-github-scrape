jonasschnelli,2016-09-20T07:05:17Z,@FrozenPrincess: this PR just hides all wallet transactions that are unconfirmed and not in your mempool (very likely conflicted).\nI guess this would be the expected behavior according to the RPC help description:\n\n```\nGet all transactions in blocks since block [blockhash][...]\n```\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8757#issuecomment-248220507,248220507,

Currently if you have a service that processes bitcoin payments, you just need to run a loop (pseudo code):\n\n```\nlastHash = null\nwhile (true ) {\n   transactions, lastHash = bitcoin-cli listsinceblock",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8757#issuecomment-248374434,248374434,
