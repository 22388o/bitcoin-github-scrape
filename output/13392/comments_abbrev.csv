Empact,2018-06-05T10:03:05Z,"Fair enough,  terminate is effectively noisy, but given terminate would be called if the exception were uncaught, ironically, this now makes errors which would have previously been blanket-caught via `catch(...)` etc a `terminate` which is a potentially problematic behavior change. But maybe I'm wrong on that? It was called out on me here relative to converting `assert`s to `throw`: #13268\n\nFT",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13392#issuecomment-394653851,394653851,
practicalswift,2018-07-20T11:58:24Z,"Hopefully we will have format string linting soon (see separate PR) and perhaps that will allow us to make `strprintf(â€¦)` `noexcept`. But I'm not sure `std::terminate` is the right way to go here in case of formatting errors. Perhaps better to just print an error message to stderr and/or return the error message to the caller? @laanwj, what do you think?\n\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13392#issuecomment-406579407,406579407,
