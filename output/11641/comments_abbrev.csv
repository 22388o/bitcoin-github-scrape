JohnVonNeumann,2017-11-09T04:34:26Z,"Interested in the use of the underscore as the variable name here, did some reading and from what I've read use of the underscore only works as something other than a variable name when used in an interactive python shell? Other than that people seem to believe it's a bad naming convention.\n\nContext: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26895362/what-does-in-python-do",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11641#discussion_r149865194,149865194,test/functional/maxuploadtarget.py
laanwj,2017-11-09T09:05:58Z,`_` as a variable name in python is a convention to indicate that the result won't be used.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11641#discussion_r149899077,149899077,test/functional/maxuploadtarget.py

laanwj,2017-11-13T19:04:00Z,"Is the order of deletion relevant? If not, something like this is both easier to read and likely more efficient:\n```\nfor x in self.p2ps:\n    if x.connection is not None:\n        x.connection.disconnect_node()\nself.p2ps = []\n```",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11641#discussion_r150633977,150633977,test/functional/test_framework/test_node.py
MarcoFalke,2017-11-13T19:06:51Z,"No, the order is not relevant. Will switch to your suggestion. (I tried to minimize the --ignore-all-space diff)",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11641#discussion_r150634723,150634723,test/functional/test_framework/test_node.py
