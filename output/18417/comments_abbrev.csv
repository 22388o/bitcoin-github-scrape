Considering updating `.clang-format` regarding this whitespace nit since it seems to be recurring (I agree with your rationale).\n\nIdeally the `.clang-format` should be written such that `clang-format -i` makes a PR immune against whitespace nits :)",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18417#discussion_r397215884,397215884,src/test/fuzz/net_permissions.cpp
practicalswift,2020-03-24 14:54:59,It is needed since `max_size == 0` means unbounded size as `CMedianFilter` is currently implemented :),https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18417#discussion_r397216344,397216344,src/test/fuzz/timedata.cpp

practicalswift,2020-03-24 15:24:49,I'm afraid equality is not defined for `CBanEntry`. That goes for quite a few of our classes :),https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18417#discussion_r397239827,397239827,src/test/fuzz/addrdb.cpp
