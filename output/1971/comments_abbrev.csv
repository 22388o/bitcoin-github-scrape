gmaxwell,2012-11-01T17:16:26Z,"running an iteration over all blocks for each transaction every time relay transactions is called may eventually become slow for wallets with a great many transactions.  ACK though, since improving that sounds hard and I don't see it being an immediate issue.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1971#issuecomment-9987962,9987962,
sipa,2012-11-01T17:24:08Z,"@gmaxwell It's a loop over all wallet transactions, the transactions contain the hash of the block they are encoded in, and those just require a lookup in mapBlockIndex to know whether this means they are confirmed. So it's a O(n_wallet_tx \* log(blocks_in_history)) operation.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1971#issuecomment-9988202,9988202,
