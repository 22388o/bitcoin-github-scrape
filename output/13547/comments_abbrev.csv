It might be cleaner to work out if the scriptPubKey implies segwit is used and not do the signature at all, but that seemed a bit more invasive.\n\nIt's currently missing tests to check signrawtransactionwithkey also fails correctly.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13547#issuecomment-400737604,400737604,
