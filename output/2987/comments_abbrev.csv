gavinandresen,2013-09-11T22:49:16Z,"Related: I've been working on un-hardcoding fees, and part of that work is an 'estimatefees' RPC call.\n\nI think that is really what people want to know, not after-the-fact whether or not the fee paid was 'voluntary' or 'mandatory'.\n\nSee my smartfee branch for details (but beware it is a work in progress, and will be constantly rebased):\n  https://github.com/gavinandresen/bitcoin-git/tree/smar",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2987#issuecomment-24282703,24282703,

laanwj,2013-11-10T08:37:19Z,"Agreed with gavin here.\n\nAs the client currently has no way to compute or negotiate what is a required to get into a block, making a voluntary/required split in this way only adds to confusion.\n\nWe can update the GUI again after smart fees have been merged. What would be ideal is a user-settable transaction priority that is used to compute the fee, instead of a ""voluntary"" fee.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2987#issuecomment-28146486,28146486,
