sipa,2014-09-02T19:37:33Z,This is not exactly equivalent (haven't verified whether it matters).\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4821#discussion_r17010190,17010190,src/rpcserver.cpp
ENikS,2014-09-02T19:46:35Z,'e' is not being used and it is faster because type of exception is not being checked.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4821#discussion_r17010712,17010712,src/rpcserver.cpp

ENikS,2014-09-02T20:04:49Z,"Well, it might be so but unlikely. \nJudging from the fact that boost::system_error derived from std::runtime_error it would be safe to assume that intention was to handle any abnormal condition.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4821#discussion_r17011971,17011971,src/rpcserver.cpp
gavinandresen,2014-09-02T20:16:32Z,NAK on replacing with catch (...).  We want errors like std::bad_alloc (out of memory) to either be handled by a higher-level catch or to cause an unhandled exception exit.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4821#discussion_r17012678,17012678,src/rpcserver.cpp
