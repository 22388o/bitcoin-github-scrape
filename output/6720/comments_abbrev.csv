eth0,2015-09-24T17:04:51Z,@jonasschnelli What advantages are offered by using the --enable-tests flag?\n\nAlso how would one learn the value of --enable-tests at the level necessary to change code behavior? I suppose you could move the MakeDeterministic method into its own source file and then only include that source when building tests but that is a bit complicated.\n\nI could also remove the ifdef  **ADDRMAN_TEST** chec,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6720#issuecomment-142990227,142990227,
jonasschnelli,2015-09-24T18:16:04Z,@eth0: maybe remote the `#ifdef __ADDRMAN_TEST__` completely or export the `ENABLE_TESTS` over `AC_DEFINE_UNQUOTED()` in `configure.ac` and use this define to determine if you compile the `MakeDeterministic()` function?\n\nIs the `newOnly` related to the new unit-tests?\n\nNice work!\nConcept ACK.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6720#issuecomment-143009243,143009243,
eth0,2015-09-24T19:28:29Z,@jonasschnelli  \nI removed the macro completely. \n\n`newOnly` is related to the unit-tests since I need a way to test if an addr is in the new or tried tables. \n\nI am developing some non-unittest code which builds on the `newOnly` functionality but it is independent of this pull-request.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6720#issuecomment-143026041,143026041,
