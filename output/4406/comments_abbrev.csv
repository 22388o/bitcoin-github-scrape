theuni,2014-06-25T04:46:13Z,"@drak I don't mean to over-complicate a seemingly simple change, but there are some non-obvious implications here. bitcoin-config.h was moved to the config dir, but devs switching to/from older branches will likely still see it in the original location. By removing it from .gitignore, it will likely end up accidentally re-added to git at some point.\n\ntl;dr Please leave the old entries there and ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4406#issuecomment-47060173,47060173,

ghost,2014-06-25T04:52:45Z,@laanwj I would tend to agree with you. I just pushed change as per @theuni but I'm tempted to revert it now because it would be better for people to know the extraneous files so they can be removed.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4406#issuecomment-47060426,47060426,
laanwj,2014-06-25T04:56:45Z,"Well I don't really insist on one way or another, but I thought I'd mention that it's not clear-cut here.\nAt some point the duplicate bitcoin-config.h even caused a build error, so anything that'd helped find the extraneous file would have been helpful :) But that bug has been fixed now.\nPersonally I never blindly add files to git, so the scenario of accidentally adding it would be rarer for me.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4406#issuecomment-47060576,47060576,
ghost,2014-06-25T04:59:29Z,"@laanwj I'm convinced the old files **should** be removed so unless I there is stronger objections from the group, I'm going to leave this patch as it is, after squashing.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4406#issuecomment-47060671,47060671,
theuni,2014-06-25T05:04:43Z,"The point of .gitignore is that they're generated files that should never be checked into source. These files have no impact if they exist from an old branch, other than the temptation to commit them. Leaving them in gitignore prevents that.\n\nBut it's a simple change not worthy of a debate, so, fine by me. Just prepare to see those files show up in git status for a while ;)\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4406#issuecomment-47060885,47060885,
