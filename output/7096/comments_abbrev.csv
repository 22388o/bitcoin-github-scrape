jonasschnelli,2015-11-25T13:56:21Z,"> That's pretty serious. Just curious: when did this break, did this problem make it into any release?\n\nI try to unroll the bug-history right now. But I'm pretty sure the 0.11er releases are affected because this RPC tests (which tests the buggy behavior) is from the 0.11er branch https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v0.11.0/qa/rpc-tests/wallet.py#L107).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7096#issuecomment-159613845,159613845,
jonasschnelli,2015-11-25T14:02:09Z,I think the problem source lays in #5200 ... especially this line was a dangerous change (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5200/files#diff-d7618bdc04db23aa74d6a5a4198c58fdR1635)\n\nDuring the subtractFeeFromAmount work we started to take the wrong behavior into RPC tests: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5831\n\nHowever: this PR needs a backport to 0.11.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7096#issuecomment-159615386,159615386,
MarcoFalke,2015-11-26T11:58:35Z,"> Supersedes: #6708\n\nLet's not call it ""supersedes"". It's an alternative bug fix with a similar result. Someone needs to check if the GUI changes are ok this way.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7096#issuecomment-159894930,159894930,
laanwj,2015-11-26T12:18:03Z,I think it would be best to split this into two pulls:\n- Fix `settxfee` RPC\n- Improve the GUI\n\nAt least the former (which is straightforward to test) must be backported to 0.11.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7096#issuecomment-159899083,159899083,
jonasschnelli,2015-11-26T12:24:13Z,"A quick fix was already opened (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6649). This PR would fix the settxfee RPC issue. But, if one uses the PRC together with the GUI, it can result in a wrong behavior. If a user presses the radio button ""Use a minimum absolute fee of"", suddenly all RPC send commands use the former `settxfee` feerate as absolute fee.\n\nWe could merge and backport 6649 and fix th",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7096#issuecomment-159900062,159900062,
