    "body": "Ok, I think my concern is that before this change, when a node starts up, once it gets through enough IBD, it's impossible to DOS it by just feeding it low difficulty full blocks, because those blocks would either have to be a fork before a checkpoint, or they wouldn't connect back to a valid chain.   After this change, I think it's possible to push through a long low-difficulty fork before the node gets through the checkpoints.  If the length is greater than the height of the last checkpoint, then from then on nothing prevents you from stuffing low difficulty blocks at this node forever until you fill up its disk or tie up its CPU.   Once you've snuck in that low difficulty long fork at the beginning it's usable any time after.\n",

Headers synchronization is however not very robust (it's easy to have a peer that just don't respond to headers request to delay the synchronization significantly), so I agree that it's better to combine this with #5875.\n",

    "body": "I'm concerned about the impact a malicious peer could have on a node starting up from scratch; in particular I think a malicious peer could partition a new node running this code from honest peers.\n\nIn 0.10 and master, when a node starts up, it picks one peer to download the headers chain from.  After the headers chain's best block time is within 24 hours of now, the node will start to download headers and then blocks from the other peers.\n\nIn master without this pull, if that sync peer is malicious or buggy and serves the node a bad chain, then once the node hits a checkpoint height, it'll recognize it as bad and disconnect that peer.  However, with this pull, the node could process a blockchain from the bad peer past the checkpoint heights.  Upon connecting to other (honest) peers, those peers will send the node a getheaders message, and it will respond with the bad chain.  Those honest peers would then disconnect the node for serving headers that violate a checkpoint, preventing the node from ever joining the honest network.\n\nFYI #6172 would limit the potential for this type of behavior by not responding to a getheaders until we're past the checkpoint height, but it is insufficient protection for this PR, because that sync node just needs to serve more blocks than the checkpoint height to create a problem (ie once the bad chain gets past the criteria for exiting IsInitialBlockDownload, the node would start inv'ing bad chain blocks to peers as the tip is updated, triggering disconnection from any honest peers who may be connected, and also preventing new connections to honest peers who would send a getheaders message upon connection).\n\nI think the principle here is that if we are going to relax requirements so that we'd sometimes allow accepting blocks that might violate a currently-existing-checkpoint, then we first need to make peers be willing to stay connected to nodes that might serve them such blocks.  That needs more thought, as we'd likely need to replace the current disconnect behavior with some other kind of DoS protection, and I'm not sure what that should look like.\n\nOne idea I had was to make IsInitialBlockDownload have some knowledge of the amount of work on the most-work-chain (rather then just use the checkpointed block height), and set a node's behavior to not deliver blocks (or headers) until exiting InitialBlockDownload -- that way, any bad chains would have to have a lot of work in order to trick a node to start trying to serve it to others and face possible disconnection.  I think this is doable, but it also feels like a workaround rather than a solution to the underlying issue, so perhaps there are better ideas out there.\n",

    "body": "@sipa @laanwj I just remembered this pull, and I think the concern I [raised earlier](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5927#issuecomment-104665085) is still a potential issue for 0.12.  Any thoughts on the best way to mitigate?\n\nOne idea I had would be to not leave IBD (and therefore not announce new blocks or respond to a getheaders message) until your main chain builds off the last checkpointed block.  When 0.12 is widely enough deployed, then in a future release we could eliminate that check (since 0.12 peers won't disconnect each other for being on the non-checkpointed chain).\n\nAn alternate idea would be to just hardcode in a value of required work on chainActive before we leave IBD, and we set that to something reasonably recent so that it would be expensive to attack.  Again, when 0.12 is widely enough deployed, we can eliminate this hardcoded value and the associated check.  But I don't love the idea of introducing a new hardcoded value...\n",
