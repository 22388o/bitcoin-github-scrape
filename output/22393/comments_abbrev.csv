sipa,2021-07-03 21:07:10,I'm not sure that's the advice we should give. There is no problem with modifying the config file while Bitcoin Core is running per se; it's just that changes won't take effect until you restart.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22393#issuecomment-873470417,873470417,
Zero-1729,2021-07-03 21:29:48,"To @sipa's point, if you are going to add a warning it should probably be to notify users that the changes take effect only after restart. `bitcoin-qt` already warns the users about it when they modify the configuration file.\n\nSo I suppose maybe rewording it to something like:\n\n```\nChanges to the configuration file while `bitcoind` or `bitcoin-qt` is running only takes effect after reset",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22393#issuecomment-873472964,873472964,

Zero-1729,2021-07-05 03:23:21,"Thanks @brunoerg and @jonatack for the catch! It should have been `restarting` instead of `reset`. `take` also fits better, grammatically speaking.\n\nSo it should (have) read:\n\n```\nChanges to the configuration file while `bitcoind` or `bitcoin-qt` is running only take effect after restarting.\n```",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22393#issuecomment-873755664,873755664,
