Verify that the transactions are confirmed.  Then shutdown that testnet-in-a-box and start a new one.\n\nGenerate a longer chain.\n\nThen join the two chains (restart a -nolisten testnet-in-a-box node from the shorter chain, and -connect it to the longer-chain testnet-in-a-box) and make sure listsinceblock does what you expect.\n\nIn case it doesn't, you should probably save away the shorter and longer chains (just save the datadirs somewhere), so re-testing is easy.\n",

    "body": "I suppose there are two ways of adding block id's for txn's. You could tag each txn with the block id e.g.[ { txid: 1, block: abc }, {txid: 2, block: abc} ... ] but since there are multiple txn per block and you are already sorted by block order you can do a more normalized { block: abc; txns: [ { txid: 1}, {txid : 2} ...] }. The feature in general would make it so convenient to pick an arbitrary block to get txn's forward from e.g. if you are looking for confirmed txn only.\n",

If you only want transactions with six confirmations or more, you call \"listsinceblock (block-id) 6\" and all of the recent transactions with 6+ confirmations would be reported.  The \"lastblock\" property on the result object would then contain the hash of the sixth most recent block instead of the most recent.  This way, when you run the command later, transactions that had under 6 confirmations last time will be reported if they have 6+ now.\n",

    "body": "I've implemented the requested change; the second parameter specifies the depth of the block you want to obtain as the \"lastblock\" return property.  The default of 1 will return the latest block ID, while 2 will return the second-latest block ID, and so on.\n\nThe command now outputs transactions with zero confirmations in addition to those in the newer blocks so that applications can act on them in some way, such as show them as pending in a UI.\n\nNote that the second parameter **does not** in any way affect which transactions are returned; if you only care about transactions with N confirms, you will pass N as the second parameter, and then filter the results down to only those with N+ confirmations.  This will ensure that the next time you run the command with the new lastblock value you won't miss any transactions that have now reached N confirmations.  But it will allow applications that want to specially handle transactions with <N confirmations to do so as well.  So this command neatly hits both use-cases.\n\n**Edit:** I've also rebased against master.\n",
