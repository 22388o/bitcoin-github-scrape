laanwj,2015-04-23T12:44:44Z,"I'm not sure adding a number here is a good idea - this makes editing harder, as sections have to be manually renumbered. As markdown has no way to auto-number sections (IIRC) it's better to just leave it.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6041#discussion_r28958437,28958437,doc/REST-interface.md
