MarcoFalke,2021-03-22 18:33:48,"The reason that the test framework path (and not the datadir) includes unicode is because wallet files can reside outside the datadir and we want to check that unicode is properly supported for them as well.\n\nI don't understand why this is causing so much trouble. Shouldn't autocomplete be able to skip over those chars anyway?\n\nIf you still want to make the changes here, it would be good t",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21502#issuecomment-804297850,804297850,

Using unicode paths instead of ASCII paths is a form of test too and no one needs to write a specific test then for current and future needs - it is somewhat elegant.
