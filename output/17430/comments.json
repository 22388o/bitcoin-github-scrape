The initial post of the PR will end up in git, and when it's merged, the person will be tagged every time the commit ends up somewhere (for example, when ported to an altcoin).\r\n- Please stop opening new PRs to replace old PRs for only minimal changes you keep doing this! As [I've told you](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17311#issuecomment-547782394) again and again, if you need to experiment with git a bit (which is not strange for a beginner), to get workflows like this right, please do so in your own repository, not ours.",
