Languages which appeared to be complete (100% translated in every branch) would then be only ~80% translated, even though 017x and 018x would be at 100%.

    "body": "@laanwj sorry if I wasn't clear enough. I'm not spending time on 0.14 - 0.16.\r\nI'd just like to tidy up translations on transifex and move translations from locales to languages ((cs_CZ) to (cs) for example), because we don't need a locale for czech language.\r\nTo do this in a clean way, I'd also have to move 0.14-0.16 translations around (or just delete them), which I can't at the moment.\r\n\r\nI was asking you for permissions/credentials to do that, but I can't exactly remember when and where.\r\nI've also sent you a message on transifex a while ago, asking for coordinator/reviewer role for slovenian language (si) and (si_SI) (account name _gasper.cefarin_).\r\n\r\nI've already done a lot of cleaning and some reorganizing on traqnsifex- you'll see the bump in edited/translated words on transifex dashboard for August.",

The person who created it, \"seone\" seems to have gone MIA, maybe @luke-jr knows more. I do not have access to the \"team\" pages, for example.\r\n\r\nMaybe for the next version it'd make sense to move to a new transifex organization.\r\n\r\nEdit: I should be able to add/delete resources though, so will try to delete those old versions.",
