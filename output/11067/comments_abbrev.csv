jnewbery,2017-08-16T15:57:54Z,"Concept ACK, but I'm concerned about defining a `wait_until` in util.py, when there's already a `wait_until` defined in mininode.py. This is a problem since wildcard imports are used in a lot of tests, so behavior will be unpredictable.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11067#issuecomment-322818043,322818043,

jnewbery,2017-08-25T16:04:58Z,I think this method should also set `self.rpc` to None,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11067#discussion_r135295391,135295391,test/functional/test_framework/test_node.py

jnewbery,2017-09-06T17:04:16Z,"This constant is now only used in one place. Perhaps remove it as a constant and add it as an integer literal in the definition of `wait_until_stopped()` with a comment.\n\nIf not, perhaps move this constant assignment down to just above the call to `wait_until_stopped()`",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11067#discussion_r137329727,137329727,test/functional/test_framework/test_node.py
MarcoFalke,2017-09-06T17:07:17Z,I prefer to put constants at the top of a file and my personal taste is that it is ugly to place them between or inside methods/functions. ,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11067#discussion_r137330456,137330456,test/functional/test_framework/test_node.py
jnewbery,2017-09-06T17:58:54Z,That's reasonable,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11067#discussion_r137343836,137343836,test/functional/test_framework/test_node.py
