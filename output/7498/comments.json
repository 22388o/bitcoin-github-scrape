    "body": "> options are in a JSON object (which is more convenient and scalable than ordered arguments).\n\nI completely agree on that.\n\nHowever the general philosophy is to not have RPC calls that can be implemented in terms of each other.\n\nIf this turns out to be much more useful API than `fundrawtransaction` then we could deprecate that one. I just think it's a waste, something that should ideally have been addressed as part of the review process for #6088 (which already superceeded PRs implementing similar commands, this didn't come out of the blue).\n\nNow, if we would merge this, we would have to carry two RPC calls that largely overlap in functionality for a while, which is a maintenance burden.\n\n**Edit:**\n\n> For me stating that fundrawtransaction has part the of functionality so it should be extended does not apply. This is a more concise, obvious and library friend way to create transactions in a single RPC call.\n\nDevil's advocate: absolutely, but isn't the \"long way around\" more flexible? Does combining the intermediate steps, all having a limited but well-defined tasks, allow doing combined operations that could never all be part of a single monolithic command?\n",

    "body": "> You can pass in a raw transaction, which can have arbitrary outputs (including non-standard scriptPubKey and ones that don't have a corresponding address), you have control over the order of the outputs, ...\n\n@sipa the way `createrawtransaction` receives the outputs is the same as `createtransaction`. Also the way the `output` argument is declared can cause problems for libraries regarding the key `data`, as stated in http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159#section-4.\n\nAnyway, I'll add the functionality to `fundrawtransaction` by allowing the second argument to be either a boolean (`includeWatching`) or a JSON object (`{ \"option\": value }`) the same way it is implemented in `createtransaction`.\n\n**Edit:**\n\nI wonder if the consensus is to drop `createtransaction`..\n",
