laanwj,2016-05-05T12:54:49Z,"Concept ACK.\n\n> Perhaps ""hideTray"" would be better than disable.\n\nI'd prefer ""setTrayVisible(bool)"" - this is closer to Qt's own usage. I agree on the positive versus negative wording in principle, but on the other hand the default could change later, so may as well make it general.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8006#issuecomment-217144957,217144957,
Tyler-Hardin,2016-05-05T13:00:43Z,"@laanwj, since we're getting verbose anyway, would ""setTrayIconVisible(bool)"" be even better? Because, technically, I'm setting the visibility on the TrayIcon.\n\nBtw, thanks for reminding me about the setVisible function. I had used an `if(flag) tray->hide(); else tray->show()` logic that I can simplify to a single line with setVisible.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8006#issuecomment-217145967,217145967,

jonasschnelli,2016-05-05T18:28:19Z,This currently results in a startup crash on OSX because `trayIcon` is NULL on OSX (see `void BitcoinGUI::createTrayIcon(const NetworkStyle *networkStyle)`).\n\nIMO this PR should remove the `#ifndef Q_OS_MAC` for the tray-icon creation (so it also gets created on OSX) and disabled it by default on OSX (over platformstyle class).\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8006#issuecomment-217234549,217234549,
laanwj,2016-05-05T20:22:48Z,"@jonasschnelli I think the reason it's not created on OSX is because the menu items are added to some other menu (which effectively acts as a tray icon). It was non-trivial to get rid of the #ifdeffing there, at least it seemed back in the day when I implmemented platformstyle.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8006#issuecomment-217267218,217267218,
