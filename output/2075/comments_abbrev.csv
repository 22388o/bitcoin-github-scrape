On the other hand, this is probably easier to explain what you're about to do, and get comments without actually coding it.\n\nOne nit: I don't like the wallet code depending on base58 encoding stuff (it's inevitable in some places because of backward compatibili",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2075#issuecomment-11674807,11674807,

Not too much sense in plowing ahead with a raft of changes which will get rejected for reasons I hadn't anticipated.\n\nI think your nit is a serious issue, actually.
