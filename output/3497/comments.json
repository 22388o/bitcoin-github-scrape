No idea if this has any other consequences, but no one ever noticed the lack of it in 0.8.\n",

This would also affect boost, qt, leveldb, etc.\n2. Ignoring 1., This is a sledgehammer fix for a single edge-case (already obsolete) toolchain.\n3. It's undocumented and non-portable.\n\nThe only reasonable way to address this problem (assuming it needs to be addressed) is at the toolchain level, either by self-building mingw or upgrading from precise.\n\nBut before going to those lengths, it's prudent to determine if it's a real-world problem. It's a mingw bug, but it's possible that it's only exposed by wine's runtimes.\n",

    "body": "Ok, new hypothesis: notice how mingw time.h has a few inlined functions that depend on `_USE_32BIT_TIME_T`: https://gist.github.com/laanwj/8342674#file-time-h-L233\n\nWell, I found out that the current gitian win32 disables optimization (CXXFLAGS and LDFLAGS are overridden without specifying optimization flags!): This means that those functions do not get inlined.\n\nAs bitcoin is built statically, and seemingly not all the dependencies are built with the same time_t size, the two definitions conflict. This explains why util.c gets linked against the wrong definition of time() with the wrong size.\n\nBuilding with optimization (even `-O`) should fix the immediate problem. I'm fairly sure of this, as I accidentally fixed it once by adding `-g -O` and thought it was the debug info that made the problem go away.\n\n(and having different time_t sizes in different dependencies is not nice either... probably something to look at too, as it could cause problems if they're exchanging time_t's, but it's one step...)\n",
