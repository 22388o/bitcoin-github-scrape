sipa,2015-07-09T13:44:56Z,@laanwj Any chance for getting this in 0.11? It should only have an effect when using both pruning and having a peer that sends unrequested blocks (such as @TheBlueMatt's relay client) - a use case that is currently broken in 0.11.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6224#issuecomment-119973348,119973348,

dcousens,2015-07-31T05:54:20Z,"Out of interest, why do we allow processing of blocks higher than `chainActive.Height() + 1` anyway?\nIf the idea is that we can synchronise faster because we don't wait for the blocks in order,  then why not just put them in a temporary cache and process them in order anyway?\nIf they drop out of that cache as being stale,  then,  all is well?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6224#issuecomment-126573946,126573946,
