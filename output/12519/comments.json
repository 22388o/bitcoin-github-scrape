    "body": "I'd rather not, as we'll be switching to sendmsg soon, instead taking advantage of scatter/gather which is highly preferable as it only requires one syscall. I've implemented this here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11227/commits/77cee166e17e355306d2ca1a1d360e71c12d8350 as part of #11227. It may make sense to go ahead and take that change rather than waiting for all of the other libevent changes to go in first.\r\n\r\nNote that something like TCP_CORK may still be useful, though, in the event that more than 1 sendmsg would be required.",
