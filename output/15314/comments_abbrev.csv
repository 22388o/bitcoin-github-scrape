harding,2019-02-01T15:22:33Z,@MarcoFalke sounds reasonable to me.  So a simple rule for me to follow would be to only remove a note from master if the corresponding feature was actually released in a backport (hopefully with documentation)?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15314#issuecomment-459758214,459758214,
