theuni,2018-03-14T04:25:29Z,"Edit: responded before seeing @sipa's comment. That would work as well, I'd just rather go ahead and make PeerLogicValidation explicitly non-derivable, as only bad things could come from doing that :)\n\n---\n\nThe issue here isn't PeerLogicValidation's lack of virtual destructor, it's that it's possible to delete a PeerLogicValidation through a base CValidationInterface or NetEventsInterface ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12680#issuecomment-372900582,372900582,
