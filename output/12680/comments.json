That would work as well, I'd just rather go ahead and make PeerLogicValidation explicitly non-derivable, as only bad things could come from doing that :)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe issue here isn't PeerLogicValidation's lack of virtual destructor, it's that it's possible to delete a PeerLogicValidation through a base CValidationInterface or NetEventsInterface pointer, or even something derived from PeerLogicValidation.\r\n\r\nMaking PeerLogicValidation's destructor virtual would only muddy the situation further, making it appear as though it's meant to be derived-from. Instead, I'd rather we address the actual issue by making sure that a PeerLogicValidation can't be deleted through a base or derived class.\r\n\r\nWe can address that, while potentially benefiting from extra devirtualization, by marking the interface destructors as protected, and the derived class as final.
