skeees,2018-04-13T18:02:50Z,"Strong concept ack - dramatically improves readiblity - if you are already going through the trouble of such an expansive change does it make sense to distinguish (via method name) for a reject with ban points and a reject with 0 score (maybe state.Reject(code,text) state.Punish(points,code,text)? Should further improve readibility / grepability",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12976#issuecomment-381216185,381216185,
Empact,2018-04-15T21:21:23Z,"@skeees Your comment is making me think I should retain Invalid and DoS, and instead do the removals and adjustments on them. @sipa expressed concern about the optional arguments resulting in missed merge conflicts.
