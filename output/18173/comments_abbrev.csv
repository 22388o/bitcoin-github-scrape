theStack,2020-02-28 20:11:03,@MarcoFalke @Empact: Thank you both for reviewing! I moved the includes for `<coins.h>` and `<script/signingprovider.h>` to the .cpp file now and just put the forward declarations for classes `CCoinsViewCache` and `FillableSigningProvider` into the header file (diff for this force-push: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/compare/f5bab9b553f74701e8684768366b0a4b477affb7..7bf4ce4f644bb7dac9b63172c65,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18173#issuecomment-592707314,592707314,

MarcoFalke,2020-02-24 17:15:14,I don't think you need the includes in the header. Forward decls should be enough if passing in references.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18173#discussion_r383399305,383399305,src/test/util/transaction_utils.h
