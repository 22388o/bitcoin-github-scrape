kallewoof,2020-01-23 13:29:48,"@laanwj It is not vital, but its absence does result in a few GBs of wasted space for anyone doing IBD on 0.19. That's for non-pruned nodes only, so it may very well be the case that a few GBs is negligible for a 250 GB datadir. (IMO hell no, but both @Sjors and @MarcoFalke disagree.)",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17988#issuecomment-577681721,577681721,
laanwj,2020-01-23 13:38:52,"@kallewoof Thank you! That doesn't seem too bad to me, though if it's virtually ready for merge, and the risk isn't too high it would be good to include. I'll wait for them to weigh in. Let's aim for tagging 0.19.1rc1 after today's meeting.\n\nEdit: discussion is in #17892 , not here",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17988#issuecomment-577685056,577685056,
