ryanofsky,2017-06-07T17:30:53Z,Probably this PR isn't needed unless #9152 or #9137 or something similar will be added. But I do think the fact that CCCoinsViewCache::Cursor() returns a cursor that doesn't actually iterate over the latest data in the view is confusing and could lead to bugs. Opened #10550 for a more direct solution to that problem.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9306#issuecomment-306867657,306867657,
