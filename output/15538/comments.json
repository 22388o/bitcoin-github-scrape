Otherwise this is extremely difficult to debug in case of a failure.\r\n\r\nThis is making an assertion about the test environment, and if it fails it probably means there is a bug in the test setup, not a bug in bitcoin. So I thought plain assert was reasonable here. Could go either way though. (For comparison, google gunit test framework has separate ASSERT_TRUE, ASSERT_EQ macros you're supposed to use for test assertions, and CHECK, CHECK_EQ macros you're supposed to use for normal code and test setup assertions).\r\n\r\n",
