If you run a node with more than 8 `-addnode` peers (you can get a list of, say, 20 peers from your addrman if needed with `bitcoin-cli getnodeaddresses 20`), you'll never see more than 8 connections in the \"manual\" column of cli `-netinfo`:\r\n```\r\n        ipv4    ipv6   onion     i2p   total   block  manual\r\nin         0       0       1       0       1\r\nout        4       0      10       4      18       2       8\r\ntotal      4       0      11       4      19\r\n```\r\nCodewise, I suggest looking at the code returned by `git grep nMaxAddnode` -- there are only six lines.\r\n ",

I have 3 follow up questions after reading few things in that PR:\r\n\r\n1. If more than 8 outgoing connections are bad for the network, can we at least have one option in `bitcoin.conf` to reduce this to something below 8 if the user wants to? Maybe keep Default=8, MIN=2, MAX=8 and OUTBOUND_FULL_RELAY_CONNECTIONS can be anything between 2 and 8.\r\n2. If the user can add more outgoing connections using `addnode` which has a separate limit so total number of full relay outgoing connections can be more than 8, is this okay and does not the involve the risks mentioned in #6014 ?\r\n3. How did we decide this number 8? Why is it not 7 or 9?",
