Indeed, as it's not documented AFAIK except in the 0.14 release notes a few years back, I imagine that many users won't ever know unless they look into the codebase, e.g. in `net.h`\n\n```cpp\nstatic const int MAX_ADDNODE_CONNECTIONS = 8;\n```\nand then verifying how the constant is used, or they infe",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21710#issuecomment-821794381,821794381,

jonatack,2021-04-17 18:30:31,"@prayank23 thanks for having a look. If you run a node with more than 8 `-addnode` peers (you can get a list of, say, 20 peers from your addrman if needed with `bitcoin-cli getnodeaddresses 20`), you'll never see more than 8 connections in the ""manual"" column of cli `-netinfo`:\n```\n        ipv4    ipv6   onion     i2p   total   block  manual\nin         0       0       1       0       1\nout",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21710#issuecomment-821867242,821867242,
