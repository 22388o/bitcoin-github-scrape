gmaxwell,2013-12-04T15:06:41Z,"Ack, also for 0.8.x (after it's merged and run for a few days in git). This appears intuitively safe.  I don't have a reproduction handy, so I don't have a good way to test it.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3357#issuecomment-29811795,29811795,

gmaxwell,2013-12-04T15:57:40Z,"The excessive relays aren't just noisy, they're a privacy problem: You're not supposed to be able to tell if someone relaying you a txn is the original source, or just someone they're relaying through, but the noise is something other peers wouldn't produce.

sipa,2013-12-04T17:03:30Z,"ACK code change, though I wonder if you couldn't just call CheckTransaction. That would make it much more obvious that we won't send out anything that we couldn't have relayed from someone else.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3357#issuecomment-29823618,29823618,
laanwj,2013-12-04T17:12:35Z,"@gmaxwell Yes, there are certainly privacy issues as well with transaction retransmission, especially in retransmitting received transactions.\n\n@sipa That would be a more general solution. Maybe also place the check in RelayTransaction itself instead of specific callers?\n\nHowever, in this pull I tried to do the minimum to prevent the immediate issue, as this has the least impact and is easiest",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3357#issuecomment-29824501,29824501,
