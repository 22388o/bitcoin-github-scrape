Diapolo,2012-06-10T12:10:44Z,"Updated and added:\n- link Apply button and OK button when enabling or disabling them (how good is a disabled Apply button, if OK saves too ^^)\n- use LookupNumeric() from netbase to verify proxy address (via an EventFilter) - allows IPv6 and fixes #821\n- change proxy address field to QValidatedLineEdit and add visual feedback\n- add a status label used for displaying a message for invalid proxy ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1433#issuecomment-6227890,6227890,

laanwj,2012-06-13T14:37:18Z,"ACK\n\nWe should find a more general way of doing the restart warnings later (for example, using a map of QWidget\* instead of booleans, so that one function can be used), but that isn't needed for this commit.\n\n**BTW: we probably need a translations update after this?**\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1433#issuecomment-6302775,6302775,
