Sjors,2019-01-30T10:21:04Z,@MarcoFalke I got rid of the Github links and switched to the more aesthetic version ordering.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15285#issuecomment-458890562,458890562,
Sjors,2019-01-30T10:28:02Z,"@laanwj I agree with that. The problem is that Python doesn't have a way to enforce backwards compatibility in any given script file. That's why I added PyEnv support in #14884 which prevents us from accidentally using Python > 3.4 syntax. The only reason for the change here is that otherwise PyEnv breaks.\n\nMaybe someone knows another approach for `configure.ac` to find the correct python exec",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15285#issuecomment-458892910,458892910,
MarcoFalke,2019-01-30T13:12:26Z,"There shouldn't be any difference in what python version `make check` runs, since all supported versions should work equally. Also, the gitian builds use the bionic python3 version, which wouldn't change with that patch.

laanwj,2019-01-31T14:08:01Z,"I'd prefer not using auto-detect at all in that case, when you know what exact Python executable you want to use. You can pass what version you want to configure.\n\nMy real point here is that I don't like treating Python 3.4 specially in auto-detection just because it happens to be used in our tests right now.

It's either `python` or `python3`, somewhere in `$PATH`, when using PyEnv.\n\nAnother approach could be to not use `python3.4` style executables, unless `python3` and `python` return a version that's unacceptably old.
