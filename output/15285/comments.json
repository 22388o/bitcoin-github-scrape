    "body": "@laanwj I agree with that. The problem is that Python doesn't have a way to enforce backwards compatibility in any given script file. That's why I added PyEnv support in #14884 which prevents us from accidentally using Python > 3.4 syntax. The only reason for the change here is that otherwise PyEnv breaks.\r\n\r\nMaybe someone knows another approach for `configure.ac` to find the correct python executable in a way compatible with PyEnv? The most obvious approach that comes to mind is to drop `python3.7 python3.6 python3.5 python3.4` entirely, and only leave `python3 python`, which do play nicely with PyEnv.\r\n\r\nI don't know if there are any systems where `python3` doesn't point to the most recently installed version. I do know on some systems `python` doesn't always link to `python3`, e.g. on macOS the default is/was Python 2 and the homebrew installation of Python 3 would leave the `python` command alone, leading to headaches.",
