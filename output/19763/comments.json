    "body": "This behavior is intentional, and the hash-based logic to determine where to send exploits it (there is a comment about `m_addr_known` in `RelayAddress`).\r\n\r\nThe idea is that every incoming addr is only relayed to a fixed subset of 1 or 2 peers during windows of 24 hours. This means that if the same address is relayed again, it will go to the same peers (and likely not be sent at all as they already know it).

    "body": "@sipa good catch! It's very unlikely to happen in an honest scenario, but a malicious one is worth discussing. I see two potential issues with relaying to one more peer:\r\n1. overcoming our spam protection (rate limiting)\r\n2. easier link inference (if a malicious node was assigned to get a probe address from a victim being link-probed, it could force a victim to send a probe address to another connection, potentially non-malicious).\r\n\r\nBoth of these effects can also be easily achieved by an attacker today by:\r\n- relaying to more random nodes in the network to get (1)\r\n- using more probe addresses (they don't even have to be real nodes) to get (2)\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the threat doesn't seem to be that big.\r\n\r\nWhile the solution you're suggesting doesn't feel very safe (thus, not adequate to address this low threat). We don't have any guarantees on `m_addr_known` at all, so, maybe a peer relayed some addr to us long time ago, and it would really benefit from getting a reannouncement of that addr, but it still sits in the `m_addr_known` so no luck.\r\nI'm already unhappy with how `m_addr_known` unpredictably affects AddrMan quality, and this would make it even deeper.\r\n\r\nPerhaps in future the issue I'm pointing out above might be addressed by making `m_addr_known` time-aware w.r.t *when an addr record was relayed* (or maybe just addr's `nTime`). It would make the effect of `m_addr_known` on AddrMans much more predictable.\r\n\r\nI'll see if an implementation makes sense (soon). Once we have better control of `m_addr_known`, I'd be more convinced in your suggestion :)\r\n\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nA note for other readers: I was about to say [we already do what Pieter suggests](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/78f912c9010f686e2d1bbdc1c51f381b496c2a1b/src/net_processing.cpp#L4134), but then realised the suggestion is to ignore it if it *comes from* a node already knowing it (not going *to* a knowing node).",

    "body": "@naumenkogs Those are good arguments. Consider my concern addressed.\r\n\r\n@vasild My thinking is that if an address is echoed back to us, then by definition, one of the two (currently) selected peers would be the originator (as it was chosen before by us). With this PR, the behavior would be:\r\n* Peer A announces an address to us\r\n* We select peers B and C to relay the address to, and send it.\r\n* B echoes the address back to us\r\n* We now select peers C and D to relay the address to, as B is the originator this time, causing an extra relay to D (as B and C have it in m_addr_known already).\r\n\r\nWhat conceptually changed here is that the set of potential destinations - across all originators - is now 3: B, C, and D. And it's not random: B and C can deterministically force us to relay to a 3rd peer.\r\n\r\nI agree this isn't a concern, but I wanted to highlight the potential here.",

I think this is an improvement even if addr relay can be further improved.\r\n\r\nI should add -- I think on balance we should be more concerned about ensuring that honest actors have their addresses relay well, more than we should be concerned about adversaries getting additional relay (I think @naumenkogs made a similar point above).  My intuition right now is that it's easy for someone circumventing our addr relay system to get their own addresses to propagate very well, while honest peers spinning up take a long time to get their addresses gossiped on the network.
