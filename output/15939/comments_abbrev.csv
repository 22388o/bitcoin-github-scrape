This allows for more focus in testing and, and hopefully a better user experience and better security, in time. Cross-compilation to windows is fraught with some risks, and they're minimized by only having one toolchain (mingw-",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15939#issuecomment-489568065,489568065,
