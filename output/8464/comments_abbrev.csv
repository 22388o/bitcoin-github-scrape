sipa,2016-08-07T19:44:33Z,@JeremyRubin I don't think so. `bitcoind` segfaults in Travis with this PR (and all rpc tests fail). In #8425 there is just a failure in one test.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8464#issuecomment-238103794,238103794,
JeremyRubin,2016-08-07T20:55:54Z,@sipa So when I run tests one by one they seem to not fail; when I run them using rpc_tests.py they do fail. Let me know if you have any ideas why this might be the case.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8464#issuecomment-238107909,238107909,

JeremyRubin,2017-01-12T14:14:33Z,"@fanquake I think I have a rebased version of this laying around somewhere. Have been doing experimentation to see if there's something simpler (read: more reviewable) that accomplishes much of the same. I'll try to see if there's a reasonable version around.
