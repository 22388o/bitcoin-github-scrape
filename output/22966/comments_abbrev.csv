sipa,2021-09-14 04:03:18,"@meshcollider I agree.\n\nI'm not opposed to codifying more things if they're actually and unambiguously used, but I'm not sure that's the case. One person's tACK may mean ""I built it and ran the unit tests""; another person's may include playing around with RPCs/GUI in testnet and trying to break it. Those are such wildly different scenarios that if we want it, the documentation should clearly e",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22966#issuecomment-918779841,918779841,
