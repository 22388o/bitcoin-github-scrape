One person's tACK may mean \"I built it and ran the unit tests\"; another person's may include playing around with RPCs/GUI in testnet and trying to break it. Those are such wildly different scenarios that if we want it, the documentation should clearly explain what it means. But I fear that today people are already using them with very different meaning, so codifying it may just add more confusion.\r\n\r\nAlso: code-review ACK, does that imply a concept ACK or not?",

It is at least possible that a reviewer disagrees with the Concept, Approach (e.g. NACKed) but still wants to ensure there aren't bugs in the code and so does a code review.\r\n\r\n> what you could do is just decode that crACK means \"code review ack\", and then highlight that for all these aliases the meaning is rather ambiguous.\r\n\r\nI'd rather people just wrote `ACK BRANCH_COMMIT` with Code Review either before or after it plus optional additional details on exactly what the code review entailed.
