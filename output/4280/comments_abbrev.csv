laanwj,2014-06-03T12:55:26Z,Why check for the tab here? Does it matter what tab is visible for the functionality?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4280#discussion_r13332234,13332234,src/qt/rpcconsole.cpp
laanwj,2014-06-03T12:56:55Z,"Same here. This looks like unnecessary logic, and if you do this, the following will fail:\n- Select another tab than 3\n- Hide the window\n- Show the window\n- Switch to tab 3\n- Statistics will not update\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4280#discussion_r13332299,13332299,src/qt/rpcconsole.cpp
Diapolo,2014-06-03T12:58:10Z,"Perhaps even the update start/stop is not necessary (what does it cost - even when minimized e.g.)!?

laanwj,2014-06-03T13:06:01Z,"Well it was an honest question. I did notice that the debug window is much larger now by default, and haven't been able to find in a quick glance why this is (the default dimensions in the .ui file don't seem to have changed).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4280#discussion_r13332670,13332670,src/qt/rpcconsole.cpp

laanwj,2014-06-03T13:17:48Z,"From what I remember it used to be that the debug window was wider than it was high. Now I get a higher window. This looks OK in the peers listing, but makes the bandwidth graph tab look funny. Maybe the automatic resizing behavior shouldn't really be there at all.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4280#discussion_r13333090,13333090,src/qt/rpcconsole.cpp
