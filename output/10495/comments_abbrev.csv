laanwj,2017-06-01T09:51:31Z,"> IIRC on some systems, gunzip symlink was not available in the default install.\n\nI tried on FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Linux (Ubuntu) and `gunzip` worked out of the box at least... Also these are not general instructions for end-users, but for ourselves. I personally find `gunzip` much easier to remember. But meh I'm fine with changing it.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10495#issuecomment-305445937,305445937,

practicalswift,2017-06-01T09:40:07Z,"@laanwj Good question! :-)  Perhaps it is a legacy thing, but for some reason I have it hard wired that `gzip -dc` is used when operating on stdin/stdout and `gunzip` is for unpacking `file.gz`, removing the original file and leaving `file`. They might be totally equivalent nowadays. If so, ignore my minor nit :-)",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10495#discussion_r119570398,119570398,contrib/seeds/README.md
