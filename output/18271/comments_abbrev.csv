ajtowns,2020-03-06 02:46:20,I think travis is failing because this catches `boost::thread_interrupted` and sometimes doesn't rethrow it. Checking `timeToWaitFor <= ::now()` prior to calling `wait_until` might work better?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18271#issuecomment-595571229,595571229,
luke-jr,2020-03-06 03:55:27,"That could break in a race (suspend after check, but before wait_until).\n\nFixed it by always rethrowing `boost::thread_interrupted` reliably.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18271#issuecomment-595587940,595587940,
