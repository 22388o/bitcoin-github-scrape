DomT4,2014-08-20T22:43:36Z,"The docs have been awaiting a refresh for a while. I posted a similar PR a week back on this subject, [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4699), but I think @theuni is planning a big docs refresh soon.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4740#issuecomment-52855656,52855656,
laanwj,2014-08-21T13:43:26Z,"Looks good to me. @theuni what do you think?\n\n@DomT4 Your PR was based on the makefile-based build system, which no longer exists. I don't think we're ready to go to a depends-only build yet.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4740#issuecomment-52921087,52921087,
theuni,2014-08-21T16:22:19Z,"Looks ok to me.\n\nI'm not sure if we'd ever want to move to depends-only build, but we could try making it the ""preferred"" way down the road (once pull-tester and gitian are using em) and see how it goes.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4740#issuecomment-52944534,52944534,
laanwj,2014-08-21T16:33:53Z,Also merged into 0.9.3 branch through 49df14d\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4740#issuecomment-52946083,52946083,
DomT4,2014-08-21T17:35:25Z,"@laanwj To be fair, the makefile part of my PR was the smallest part of it. It would have been easy enough to cut that out and just update the dependency side of it, but I respect your viewpoint on this. Happy to see any documentation improvement merged.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4740#issuecomment-52954587,52954587,
laanwj,2014-08-22T06:26:21Z,@DomT4 no problem; shall I reopen your pull then so you can update it for master?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4740#issuecomment-53027372,53027372,
DomT4,2014-08-22T14:51:23Z,"It looks like this one was merged into the Master branch? If so, there's only one additional change I'd particularly like to suggest, which is that we stop encouraging people to force link Homebrew's OpenSSL into `/usr/local`, but I need to take a look at Bitcoin's new make system and see if that's still possible.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4740#issuecomment-53069859,53069859,
rktoomey,2014-08-22T15:25:59Z,Is it even necessary?  I didn't forcelink OpenSSL into `/usr/local` and the configure/make/install proceeded just fine - `bitcoind` is working (although I haven't tried to turn on SSL for rpc yet).  \n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4740#issuecomment-53074664,53074664,
DomT4,2014-08-22T15:38:23Z,"No, It shouldn't be necessary. Even if it was necessary, if you're using Bash you can even add the Homebrew OpenSSL directory to your $PATH temporarily, and then build, which would solve the problem in a less risky way. There are a few ways to go about achieving this without the need to force OpenSSL to link to `/usr/local`.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4740#issuecomment-53076335,53076335,
theuni,2014-08-22T15:42:02Z,"It shouldn't be necessary. So if that's in the docs, it should be removed.\n\nThe osx build checks to see if homebrew is being used. If it is, it queries homebrew for openssl's path and updates PKG_CONFIG_PATH to reflect it.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4740#issuecomment-53076840,53076840,
