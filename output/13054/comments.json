    "body": "I see two possible states of the world:\r\n\r\n* **State 1 \u2013 Travis does not check wildcard imports:** A Python PR introducing wildcard imports is opened. During the review process human reviewers (such as perhaps me, @kallewoof, @jnewbery, @JeremyRubin and @jtimon - who have historically voiced their concern about wildcard imports) will point out that wildcard imports are problematic and discouraged. The human reviewer will explain that wildcard imports (`from <module> import *`) should be avoided, as they make it unclear which names are present in the namespace, confusing both readers and many automated tools. After some discussion the PR author will switch to using explicit imports. The normal review process takes place focusing on non-trivial/non-mechanical stuff.\r\n\r\n* **State 2 \u2013 Travis does check wildcard imports:** A Python PR introducing wildcard imports is opened. Travis complains within literally one minute. The PR author switches to using explicit imports before the ordinary review process starts . The normal review process takes place focusing on non-trivial/non-mechanical stuff.\r\n\r\nEnergy used by the different participants:\r\n* Energy used by PR author assuming state 1: Discussing review (`D`). Adjusting code (`A`).\r\n* Energy used by PR author assuming state 2: Adjusting code (`A`).\r\n* Energy used by `n` human reviewers assuming state 1: Reviewing (`n * R`), where `n > 0`.\r\n* Energy used by `n` human reviewers assuming state 2: None (`0`).\r\n\r\nNet effects:\r\n* Energy used assuming state 1: `D + A + n * R`\r\n* Energy used assuming state 2: `A`\r\n\r\n**Conclusion:** It seems like all participants \u2013 PR author and human reviewers \u2013 are better off in state 2. What are compelling arguments for choosing state 1?\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if any of the assumptions stated above is incorrect.",

But as a matter of process, I don't think style nits for things that are not part of the project's style guide are appropriate PR comments.  If you'd like to enforce a project-wide policy, I think you should start a discussion about that in a PR that would update the style guide.  Otherwise we should expect people with different personal style preferences to object for things that seem arbitrary.\r\n\r\nDo we even have python style guidelines anywhere in our tree, apart from this linter in contrib/?  If we're going to impose rules, we should document them so contributors know what is expected.\r\n\r\nEDIT: I found this in `test/functional/README.md`:\r\n\r\n#### Style guidelines\r\n\r\n- Where possible, try to adhere to [PEP-8 guidelines]([https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)\r\n- Use a python linter like flake8 before submitting PRs to catch common style\r\n  nits (eg trailing whitespace, unused imports, etc)\r\n- Avoid wildcard imports where possible\r\n- Use a module-level docstring to describe what the test is testing, and how it\r\n  is testing it.\r\n- When subclassing the BitcoinTestFramwork, place overrides for the\r\n  `set_test_params()`, `add_options()` and `setup_xxxx()` methods at the top of\r\n  the subclass, then locally-defined helper methods, then the `run_test()` method.\r\n\r\nI think this is a bit unspecific if the project's rules now are that a PR will not be accepted unless the linter passes; someone should update this to reflect the project's new philosophy on python style.",

    "body": "It wasn't that only a small group of people insisted on doing it, but really a different person each time (see #9876 by @jnewbery, #10366 @kallewoof and #11274 @mess110). Also this one had many Concept ACKs from different contributors (not going to list them, just scroll up a bit).\r\n\r\nSo I feel like there is a threshold where something controversial can be merged if it has enough support. Another way of thinking of it, which I sometimes use to decide if a pull request should be merged: \"Imagine this already was merged, but someone proposed to revert the change. Would it be worthwhile to merge?\"\r\n\r\nBack to this topic, personally I am a huge fan of the `__all__` import: https://docs.python.org/3.5/tutorial/modules.html#importing-from-a-package. I'd be in favour to take a step back and replace some of the explicit imports with an `__all__` import, where appropriate.",

It looks like the author intended to break it into pieces before merging.\r\n\r\nReading through the comments, there was no one directly disagreeing with doing this. @sdaftuar had some concerns that I believe were addressed, but mostly this was a \"lets not do too big changes cause we don't wanna make big changes\" which is a valid reason most of the time, but IMO not here.\r\n\r\nI.e. I don't think anyone is insisting on something repeatedly in spite of disagreement. We're all just trying to make this repo as good as it can get with what skills we have.",
