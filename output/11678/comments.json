    "body": "> but it doesn't seem right that every wallet should be closed and reopened when one wallet is encrypted.\r\n\r\nThis was easier to do since there are some things in the GUI that look specifically for `vpwallets[0]`, so to close and reopen a wallet would require remove the pointer from that position in `vpwallets` and then replacing it with the newly opened wallet. That seemed to be more complicated to me than just closing and reopening all wallets, especially since order is more guaranteed to be preserved doing that than modifying `vpwallets` directly.\r\n\r\n> I don't even see a reason why the wallet that is being encrypted needs have all it's in-memory state thrown away and then the same data reloaded from disk.\r\n\r\nI thought that there were still some in-memory things that needed to be discarded (e.g. unencrypted keys) to ensure security of the wallet.",
