You don't want to know how long I've spent getting the Qt build working.\r\n>\r\n> Putting aside the lost chunk of my life it would be a big change switching the build to dynamic linking. All the Bitcoin Core libraries would have to be built as dll's and there are then bound to be missing exports that will need to be added which would mean code changes.\r\n>\r\n> I'd highly recommend sticking with static linking for consistency with the other Bitcoin Core builds. Hopefully one day the `vcpkg` static build of Qt will work and allow it to be treated the same as the other dependencies for the msvc build. See microsoft/vcpkg#4560 (comment).",

The following instructions assume that this folder is `C:\\dev\\qt-source`.\n+\n+2. Open \"x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2019\", and input the following commands:\n+```cmd\n+cd C:\\dev\\qt-source\n+mkdir build\n+cd build\n+..\\configure -release -silent -opensource -confirm-license -opengl desktop -no-shared -static -static-runtime -mp -qt-zlib -qt-pcre -qt-libpng -no-libjpeg -nomake examples -nomake tests -nomake tools -no-dbus -no-libudev -no-icu -no-gtk -no-opengles3 -no-angle -no-sql-sqlite -no-sql-odbc -no-sqlite -no-libudev -no-vulkan -skip qt3d -skip qtactiveqt -skip qtandroidextras -skip qtcanvas3d -skip qtcharts -skip qtconnectivity -skip qtdatavis3d -skip qtdeclarative -skip qtdoc -skip qtgamepad -skip qtgraphicaleffects -skip qtimageformats -skip qtlocation -skip qtmacextras -skip qtmultimedia -skip qtnetworkauth -skip qtpurchasing -skip qtquickcontrols -skip qtquickcontrols2 -skip qtscript -skip qtscxml -skip qtsensors -skip qtserialbus -skip qtserialport -skip qtspeech -skip qtvirtualkeyboard -skip qtwayland -skip qtwebchannel -skip qtwebengine -skip qtwebsockets -skip qtwebview -skip qtx11extras -skip qtxmlpatterns -no-openssl -no-feature-sql -no-feature-sqlmodel -prefix C:\\Qt_static\n+nmake\n+nmake install\n+```\n \n-Some prebuilt x64 versions of Qt can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/sipsorcery/qt_win_binary/releases). Please be aware these downloads are NOT officially sanctioned by Bitcoin Core and are provided for developer convenience only. They should NOT be used for builds that will be used in a production environment or with real funds.\n+One could speed up building with [`jom`](https://wiki.qt.io/Jom), a replacement for `nmake` which makes use of all CPU cores.\n \n-To determine which Qt prebuilt version to download open the `.appveyor.yml` file and note the `QT_DOWNLOAD_URL`. When extracting the zip file the destination path must be set to `C:\\`. This is due to the way that Qt includes, libraries and tools use internal paths.\n+To build Bitcoin Core without Qt, unload or disable the `bitcoin-qt`, `libbitcoin_qt` and `test_bitcoin-qt` projects.\n \n-To build Bitcoin Core without Qt unload or disable the `bitcoin-qt`, `libbitcoin_qt` and `test_bitcoin-qt` projects.\n \n Building\n ---------------------\n-The instructions below use `vcpkg` to install the dependencies.\n-\n-- Install [`vcpkg`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg).\n-\n-- Use Python to generate `*.vcxproj` from Makefile\n+1. Use Python to generate `*.vcxproj` from Makefile:\n \n ```\n PS >py -3 msvc-autogen.py\n ```\n \n-- An optional step is to adjust the settings in the `build_msvc` directory and the `common.init.vcxproj` file. This project file contains settings that are common to all projects such as the runtime library version and target Windows SDK version. The Qt directories can also be set.\n+2. An optional step is to adjust the settings in the `build_msvc` directory and the `common.init.vcxproj` file. This project file contains settings that are common to all projects such as the runtime library version and target Windows SDK version. The Qt directories can also be set. To specify a non-default path to a static Qt package directory, use the `QTBASEDIR` environment variable.\n \n-- To build from the command line with the Visual Studio 2019 toolchain use:\n+3. To build from the command-line with the Visual Studio 2019 toolchain use:\n \n-```\n-msbuild /m bitcoin.sln /p:Platform=x64 /p:Configuration=Release /t:build\n+```cmd\n+msbuild -property:Configuration=Release -maxCpuCount -verbosity:minimal bitcoin.sln\n ```\n \n-- Alternatively, open the `build_msvc/bitcoin.sln` file in Visual Studio 2019.\n+Alternatively, open the `build_msvc/bitcoin.sln` file in Visual Studio 2019.\n \n AppVeyor\n ---------------------",
