I'm looking for a way to export all of my public addresses, both created normally and those in the keypool, without having to parse wallet.dat manually. It would be fantastic if the dumpwallet command had an argument to suppress output of private keys.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2592#issuecomment-18126058,18126058,

sipa,2013-05-22T05:05:30Z,"@luke-jr I disagree. For a wallet format you mainly want strong consistency guarantees and easy updating. An export/import format is write-once anyway, and is preferably compatible with other clients and transparent.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2592#issuecomment-18257707,18257707,

I don't think this will conflict (much) with #1863, they will only interact via future functionality building on both (use GetKeyBirthTimes to fill in unknown birthdates, use known birthdates when dumping, ...).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2592#issuecomment-18694908,18694908,
