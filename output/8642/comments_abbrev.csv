sipa,2016-09-01T08:32:17Z,"This does not reduce reliance on the nVersion protocol, because recent additions are always negotiated separately (see the `sendheaders` and `sendcmpct` messages).\n\nAll this patch does is gratuitously break support with some old versions that may still be out there.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8642#issuecomment-244012215,244012215,
rebroad,2016-09-01T08:33:47Z,"@sipa those recent additions you're mentioning are examples of where nVersion is being relied upon.\n\nWhich versions does it break support for? And ARE those versions still out there? And are we talking about more nodes, for example, than the nodes I am talking about (which break from the nVersion norms being discussed here)? E.g. There are at least 18 Unlimited nodes running on the network. I su",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8642#issuecomment-244012565,244012565,

sipa,2016-09-01T08:41:41Z,"Sendheaders and compact blocks are negotiated separately.
