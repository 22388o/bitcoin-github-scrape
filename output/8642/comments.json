And are we talking about more nodes, for example, than the nodes I am talking about (which break from the nVersion norms being discussed here)? E.g. There are at least 18 Unlimited nodes running on the network. I suspect nodes with version below 60000 are far fewer (if any!). We've already stopped support for Windows XP.. when are we planning to stop support for protocol < 60000 ?\n",

I don't have the figures to hand though but would you agree that if this is the case that we should be supporting the nodes that are greater in numbers?\n",

Either separate advertisement mechanisms have been used or service flags. I still agree that forcing a linear progression of unrelated features is a mistake: we corrected this for NODE_BLOOM.\n\nFor the things that already rely on nVersion, that's too bad, we have to keep them to keep compatibility with older clients. NACK on this change (there may be valid reasons to break compatibility with ancient versions, but this isn't one).\n",
