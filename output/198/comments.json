    "body": "I believe it will only do the callback for newly arriving blocks when doing a reorganisation, and not for replacements of older blocks (didn't test it though). If that's not what you want, the call to monitorBlock() should go in CBlock::ConnectBlock() (called for each block that's being added to the main chain).\n\nDependent transactions are only used for self-created transactions, so that isn't an issue I believe.\n\nAlso, if monitortx is only for your own transactions, i believe its list of listeners should go in CWallet (at least for now), and the callback in CWallet::AddToWallet(). I intended the dispatch functions in main.cpp (incl. SyncWithWallets) to be replacable with a generic listener system one day, so i prefer them not to contain any real logic.\n",
