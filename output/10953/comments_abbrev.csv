jl2012,2017-09-19T17:53:59Z,actually the name `out` is taken from https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v0.15.0.1/src/coins.h#L33 . So for consistency we have to keep it.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10953#discussion_r139768408,139768408,src/validation.h
jnewbery,2017-09-19T18:01:36Z,I don't understand. That's for `Coin` class member. Why does the `CScriptCheck` member need to be named the same simply because it's of the same type?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10953#discussion_r139770467,139770467,src/validation.h
