laanwj,2014-08-02T03:47:13Z,"There is no point in this change. Bitcoinstrings.cpp is an auto-generated file, and without a change to the source messages it will just break translations.\n\nIf you want to change these messages you need to find them in src/*.cpp and change there, then run `make translate` to re-generate the translation files.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4619#issuecomment-50953015,50953015,
pryds,2014-08-02T07:29:20Z,@laanwj makes total sense; my bad. I've now reverted the changes to the auto-generated file and applied the changes to the relevant src/*.cpp files instead.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4619#issuecomment-50956516,50956516,

pryds,2014-08-02T09:36:41Z,"Ok, I seem to have messed things up while squashing, mixing in someone else's commits. If this cannot be used, I will delete my fork, remake it and do a clean commit and new pull request.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4619#issuecomment-50958626,50958626,
