MarcoFalke,2020-01-21 17:36:17,Please use the backport script or include the backport metatdata manually. Otherwise it is hard to verify this and see where it came from without any references to the original commit/pull.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17974#issuecomment-576794101,576794101,
instagibbs,2020-01-21 17:58:57,@MarcoFalke is there a TLDR for the script with deps etc or the metadata required to be included where? This should probably be a `CONTIRBUTION.md` thing?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17974#issuecomment-576803509,576803509,
MarcoFalke,2020-01-21 18:16:42,"I think if you cherry-pick the commit from 0.19, it should include all metadata.\n\nThere is a python helper script: https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-maintainer-tools#backport\n\nNot sure if this should be generally made available for any contributor. Asking for a ""needs backport"" tag should be sufficient",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17974#issuecomment-576810897,576810897,
