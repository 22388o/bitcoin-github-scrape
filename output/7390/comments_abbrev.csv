laanwj,2016-01-22T12:32:14Z,"I may be confusing things, but I think this change is incorrect: \nOne would use this functionality to get the hash to pay to a script (to be specified in the input claiming this output), to use in a P2SH output script.\nIf something is already a P2SH output script (signified by `script.IsPayToScriptHash`), there's no use to hash it into another one. After all, you can't pay to another output.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7390#issuecomment-173908829,173908829,

With that in mind, I recommend either\n- Using that sole element of the ""addresses"" array for the ""p2sh"" string, or\n- Not outputting any ""p2sh"" string.\n\nI can implement either one.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7390#issuecomment-173915498,173915498,
