ajtowns,2018-03-29T00:55:49Z,This works fine locally but github will still report a merge conflict.

laanwj,2018-03-29T13:33:25Z,"Can you elaborate on what the result of this will be? The git documentation says this on union merges:\n\n>  Instead of leaving conflicts in the file, resolve conflicts favouring our (or their or both) side of the lines.\n\nDoes this mean it prefers losing information (by taking from either side) to adding conflicts?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12823#issuecomment-377236236,377236236,
MarcoFalke,2018-03-29T13:54:27Z,"The documentation is for all three options, which explains the weird structure of the sentence.\n\nThe explanation for `--union` is ""Instead of leaving conflicts in the file, resolve conflicts favouring <strike>our (or their or</strike> both) side of the lines.""\n\n\nhttps://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge-file#git-merge-file---union ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12823#issuecomment-377242553,377242553,
MarcoFalke,2018-03-29T13:56:24Z,"Which means that for *any* conflict it will include both sides. That is fine if both sides add stuff, but does not work too well if both sides remove the same line.

jnewbery,2018-03-29T14:11:11Z,"> We don't use GitHub for merges, so I guess that is fine.\n\nI think the benefit of this PR would be if it didn't cause GitHub to say that a PR has conflicts (and therefore needs rebase).
