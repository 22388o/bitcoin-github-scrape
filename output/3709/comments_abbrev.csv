gmaxwell,2014-02-19T22:14:53Z,NAK. If someone wants more connections they can enable inbound instead of abusing network resources. If they want fewer we already have max connections.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3709#issuecomment-35556449,35556449,

int03h,2014-02-19T22:21:52Z,oddly enough I did this last night based on http://roland.beyondweb.net/ .. I had the pleasure of exceeding my monthly limit with Comcast last night as I managed to create 50GB of traffic for myself. If I have any vote here I too would not accept this pull.  I went to 100. Maybe a little crazy ;) but it highlighted the behaviour. I changed it back to 8 this morning. :) \n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3709#issuecomment-35557163,35557163,
