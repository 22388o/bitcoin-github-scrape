mzumsande,2019-11-25 13:54:46,"I used the suffix because we already have `wallet.h` twice. No strong opinion either though, so I am happy to change it after the CIs are through.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17593#discussion_r350195111,350195111,src/Makefile.test_util.include
MarcoFalke,2019-11-25 14:06:33,"Yeah, we use the include guards e.g. `BITCOIN_TEST_UTIL_WALLET_UTILS_H` to protect against duplicate includes and the `<>` import to protect against including the wrong path. So it should be fine to have three `wallet.h`\n\nThe travis CI passed and the appveyor ci is failing on master currently, so no need to wait for that.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17593#discussion_r350202138,350202138,src/Makefile.test_util.include
mzumsande,2019-11-25 15:44:25,"Ok, I renamed and rebased.\nAs to move-only, note that I removed one include from `util.cpp` (validationinterface) that I could not allocate to any of the helper functions.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17593#discussion_r350261928,350261928,src/Makefile.test_util.include
