laanwj,2014-12-16T07:03:02Z,"Yes for zero it should be `0 s`, for the sake of sanity let's report zero like all other values :)\n\nI like the concept as well.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5476#issuecomment-67120327,67120327,
paveljanik,2014-12-16T07:15:03Z,"It is ""0 s"" now. I do not like ""0"" because the typical usage (for me) is to scroll down the list of peers and watch their time offset and ""0"" distracts me, because the ""s"" letter disappeared.
