They increase PR traffic and code churn for no discernible benefit. Contributor, reviewer and maintainer time would be better employed in fixing known bugs or adding features. There are currently 552 issues open against this repo: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues. We should focus on tackling those rather than opening code style refactor PRs.",
