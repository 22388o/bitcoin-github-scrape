    "body": "It's well documented that I'm an asshole. I want to ensure you that this PR was\nmade in good faith. I'm trying to do better w/ the asshole thing but things are\nhard to change over night. I only opened the libbitcoin one because I didn't\nrealize @genjix was no longer lead and assumed he would be all for it. I did not\nexpect it to end in literal racial slurs. I am absolutely appaled by that. libbitcoin/libbitcoin#355\n\nI've recently had some experiences and seen examples of why things like this\nare useful. I used to oppose them too. But I've been convinced, oddly enough by\n@hintjens and a few others' extremely eloquent writing on the subject combined\nwith the Clusterfuck of \"bro\" culture I've encountered since moving to the Bay\nArea.\n\nPlease don't think I'm trolling. I'm not going to answer the personal attacks,\nas I've stated, it's not worth it.\n\nI would honestly like a direct declaration of support of a similar CoC in some\nform. Our _industry_ (not crypto currency, tech) is hurting itself with strict\nadherence to its own idealism and excluding very useful contributors.\n\nThe recent glaringly obvious comment was in reference to this insane \"Chinese\nminer\" vs the world nonsense going on with personal attacks flying everywhere.\nIt's disgusting especially at a time of such huge wins re: criminal prosecution\nof fraudsters and acceptance by the SEC for securities issuance.\n\nI know it's not being encouraged by the core devs and I think you know that I\nrespect the vast majority of you guys even if my tone is harsh and word choice\nhorrible at times. Again, I know it's not coming from core devs but there are other\nprojects that encourage similar and I just think a bold, clear, statement to\nthat effect by the core guys may go a long way to making this community a\nbetter place for everyone.\n\nI knew associating my name with it would steal some of the concept's\ncredibility. But like others in this community have said. \"Anything worth doing\nis worth putting your name on.\" No one else was proposing so I did.\n\nI probably should have been more thorough in uniquely differentiating these\ndifferent pull requests and can understand how it could seem to be imposing a\nbad impression. That is my bad and totally on me. I sincerely apologize for\nthat. Do not let my communication skills derail discussion of, what I believe\nto be, a very important topic for _any_ community but especially this one of as\nof late.\n\n(just to get them linked in the others: bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org#1167 bitcoin/secp256k1#369)\n",

    "body": "I've seen some devious, manipulative behavior in the bitcoin-core developer community but none that the basic kindergarten rules outlined here would prevent. _This_ kind of behavior usually comes from outside, e.g. \"vote\" floods from reddit and no, those people won't read or heed a document like this any way - they expect to be banned and create an account just for that.\n\n> I'm ok with a code of conduct, I'm not ok with abusive pull requests that violate said code of conduct, like this one.\n\nSame here. I don't think it would hurt to write down how we, as a developer community, intend to behave toward each other.\nBut that would have to apply to specific incidents in our community and not a copy/paste code of conduct which misses the buck.\n\n> I am still interested in a constructive conversation on this topic and would like advice on how to elicit such constructively.\n\nRight, after first trying to inject a code of conduct into a project with the intent to create a shitstorm. You may not be violating the letter of your own code of conduct but certainly the spirit. This does kind of remove any motivation to include you in constructive conversation about this subject.\n",
