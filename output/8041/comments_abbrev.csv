If I understand it and am able to reproduce, I'd feel better üëç \n\nEdit: FWIW: it never failed for me locally, either by running it individually or as part of the pull-tester.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8041#issuecomment-218443716,218443716,
MarcoFalke,2016-05-11T12:32:14Z,"@paveljanik It never failed for me locally, either. But I assume the failure (print to stderr) is caused by deleting the blocks.db and not closing the db connection.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8041#issuecomment-218445430,218445430,
MarcoFalke,2016-05-11T12:34:36Z,"@btcdrak It should fail for both, though. The pull tester is only a convenience wrapper, so you don't have to type each command by yourself.
