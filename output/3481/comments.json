    "body": "Sure, I'll try to answer all questions that may arise.\n\nThe site is run by me, cdecker, as part of my research into the bitcoin network. I'm already doing measurements on the network population so adding a way to support the network by offering a DNS seed seems like a good way to give back.\n\nThe entire software stack is hosted at ETH Zurich, on some personal machines I am using for my own research and other projects. It's custom built crawler on top of my Bitcoin protocol implementation that listens for `addr` announcements and then attempts to connect to the advertised host (I took great care to control the rate at which individual hosts are tested in order to minimize impact). The DNS server is implemented in python and returns a sample of the most recent successful tests, this should ensure that only actually reachable hosts are referred.\n\nResults are stored in a DB in real time, and periodically refreshed by the DNS server every 5 seconds. The TTL is set to 60 seconds, in accordance with the DNS server by dashjr, sipa and bluematt.\n\nSo far it's looking good. I implemented a small tester tool that retrieves DNS bootstrap data and tests the returned nodes for reachability:\n\n![download](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/120117/1832915/2b307d0e-73c0-11e3-986b-b1665dfca7d1.png)\n\nThe reachability of nodes returned by seed.bitcoinstats.com is well above 90% and comparable with sipa's and dashjr's DNS seeds.\n\nPlease let me know if any additional information is required.\n",
