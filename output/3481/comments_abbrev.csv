jgarzik,2014-01-02T14:41:21Z,"DNS seeds are currently semi-trusted infrastructure (alas), which implies an increased validation requirement for new DNS seeds.\n\nQuestions, which may be answered in this thread (ideal) or via private email to core (not ideal):   who runs bitcoinstats.com?  What is the software?  What style of data sampling is used to obtain node lists?  How frequently are the node lists recycled on the DNS serv",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3481#issuecomment-31456255,31456255,

I'm already doing measurements on the network population so adding a way to support the network by offering a DNS seed seems like a good way to give back.\n\nThe entire software stack is hosted at ETH Zurich, on some personal machines I am using for my own rese",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3481#issuecomment-31458727,31458727,

Most notably, my DNS seed (xf2.org) is intentionally last, because it is a static, manually updated list.\n\nI would propose that new DNS seeds -- this pull req being a clear example -- should always be added at the end of the list -- modulo the special case of seeds like xf2.org.\n\nTherefore, put your entry just _a",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3481#issuecomment-31460996,31460996,

Otherwise, it would seem to me that having more geographically distributed DNS seeds is a good thing:\n- bitcoin.sipa.be → Rotterdam, The Netherlands\n- dnsseed.bluematt.me → New York, United States\n- dnsseed.bitcoin.dashjr.org → Buffalo, United States\n- bitseed.xf2.org → Skyland, United States\n\nThe one to be added\n- seed.bitcoinstats.c",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3481#issuecomment-31511007,31511007,
cdecker,2014-01-03T13:17:28Z,"Thanks Wladimir, I do agree that spreading the seeds across the globe increases resilience. The same applies to the software used by the seeds, otherwise a single bug may take them all down at once.\n\nThe machines running the seed are my personal work machines. The reason I mentioned it is to assure you that I'm the only one that has access to these machines and I'm the one responsible for them.
