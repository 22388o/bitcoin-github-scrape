fanquake,2014-08-22T06:41:09Z,@TheBlueMatt The only way to access the binaries would be to upload them to S3 after compilation. \nhttp://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/s3/\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4749#issuecomment-53028216,53028216,

theuni,2014-08-22T15:19:55Z,"@TheBlueMatt there are actually several ways to deploy, see here: http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/ . I figured we'd probably use the custom one to push to some server space we control, but s3 would be fine by me as well.\n\nI left deployment out of the original PR because I figured it'd be worth discussing on its own. Same with notifications. Like everything else with Travis, we don't ha",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4749#issuecomment-53073756,53073756,
TheBlueMatt,2014-08-22T18:02:00Z,"@theuni Yea, we do have a server we can stick crap like this on.

theuni,2014-08-25T14:33:54Z,Note that we'll need to do the same thing for creating secure scp credentials (ssh key and/or password) for uploading build results as well.

theuni,2014-08-26T01:57:56Z,"@TheBlueMatt agreed, I'm working on that. It proved to be more challenging than anticipated, since Travis assumes that it will publish from commits and/or tags, rather than pull requests (which makes sense in terms of publishing).

sipa,2014-08-25T21:20:44Z,All .o files in my local installation together is a multiple of 100M already. Does it help at all if it can't even cache one full build's results?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4749#discussion_r16681817,16681817,.travis.yml
theuni,2014-08-25T21:49:35Z,"@sipa: These are non-debug, so significantly smaller than typical dev objects. They're also gzip compressed (see 2 lines down).
