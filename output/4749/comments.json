I figured we'd probably use the custom one to push to some server space we control, but s3 would be fine by me as well.\n\nI left deployment out of the original PR because I figured it'd be worth discussing on its own. Same with notifications. Like everything else with Travis, we don't have to worry about any kind of server-side state, so everything is handled in the .yml file. So all deployment/notification changes will actually happen via git commits.\n",

    "body": "@sipa: These are non-debug, so significantly smaller than typical dev objects. They're also gzip compressed (see 2 lines down). A full linux build that way results in a ~17mb ccache dir. For reference, the exact same build _with_ debug is 105mb. That's probably more inline with what you're seeing?\n\nAlso, as I see it, there's really no use in keeping more than one version of each object around, since each cache matches a single build config. It either matches the current revision or it can be discarded. So my target with the 100mb figure was the largest reasonable compressed store of one version of all objects. \n",
