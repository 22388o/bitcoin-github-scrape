morcos,2016-11-22T14:42:42Z,"@jonasschnelli Does anyone else think its a bit too easy to actually turn off your whole network.  I think this tooltip will help a bit, but it seems a pretty benign thing to just click on that little network symbol and you don't realize you're disconnecting yourself from the network.
