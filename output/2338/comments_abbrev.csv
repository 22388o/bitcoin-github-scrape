TheBlueMatt,2013-02-25T01:40:08Z,I figure I get this simply included in the protocol so that we can later bother with the actual download optimizations.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2338#issuecomment-14022177,14022177,

mikehearn,2013-02-25T10:34:16Z,"Hah, neat. Do the merkle blocks generated by such a filter have much overhead for the representation vs just a generic list of hashes?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2338#issuecomment-14034730,14034730,
sipa,2013-02-25T11:38:13Z,@mikehearn 8 bytes + 0.25 byte/tx + overhead of sending the transactions in separate messages instead of inline in a block.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2338#issuecomment-14037030,14037030,
mikehearn,2013-02-25T15:07:45Z,Actually 32.25 bytes per tx (we chatted about it offline)\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2338#issuecomment-14047166,14047166,
TheBlueMatt,2013-02-25T18:47:38Z,"Yea, I think thats pretty good considering you have to atleast transfer the 32-byte sha256 hash of the tx (atleast given that you've already received most, if not all, of the txn in question).\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2338#issuecomment-14064677,14064677,
gmaxwell,2013-02-25T18:55:37Z,"@TheBlueMatt not horrible, though a protocol made just for this could transmit— say— 8 bytes instead, and then just pull the whole block in the insanely rare case that there is a collision. Probably not worth doing inside the bitcoin p2p protocol however.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2338#issuecomment-14065572,14065572,
TheBlueMatt,2013-02-25T23:12:46Z,"Yea, absolutely could do better, but since this is already in the protocol, I figured I might as well enable it without wasting tons of CPU cycles hashing.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2338#issuecomment-14082448,14082448,
