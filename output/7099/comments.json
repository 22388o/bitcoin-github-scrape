    "body": "The forced relaying has made whitelistning useless to me since day one: It means I cannot whitelist my mining software (so that it won't get banned), it means I cannot whitelist the relay node client (so that it won't get banned and can populate my mempool).  It means I cannot whitelist nodes inside my network (that run various sets of software and sometimes spam invalid transactions) to bypass the bandwidth limiter. I have never heard from anyone but armory users using it in that gatewayed mode.\n\nThe invalid tx relay in particular is problematic. It means that as validity rules change you can't protect yourself from getting banned for sending invalid things by being a whitelisted client behind an updated node.\n\nThere are three states to consider for transactions from a whitelisted peer: They've sent us something invalid (for example an armory wallet which isn't yet enforcing lowS), they've sent us something our policy rejects (our fee policy is more restrictive than the network, or we're blocksonly), or they've sent us something we've already relayed.\n\nEach one of these precludes the above uses for whitelisting I have, except maybe the last (I believe RNC and p2pool will both potentially repeat transactions-- but that could be fixed).\n\nMaybe we should unconditionally never forward invalid transactions; and if we did, I wouldn't mind putting this back to default on. Although, I still think the multipliexer usage is very specialized and surprising, and doesn't fit with the usage of whitelisting to bypass resource limits; and so I think this should be possible to disable.\n",
