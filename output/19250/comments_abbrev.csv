laanwj,2020-06-11 16:31:24,"I don't think calling this 'move-only', while strictly correct, is what we usually mean with that. It implies that whole functions are moved keeping the functionality the same hence 'move-**only**'.\n\nACK otherwise. The help doesn't depend on the wallet being loaded, or what wallet is selected, so moving this upfront makes sense.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19250#issuecomment-642792549,642792549,
