    "body": "> I don't get this part, are you referring to Compact Blocks?\r\n\r\nCompact blocks are able to relay blocks without any roundtrips if all the blocks' transactions (excluding the coinbase) are known to the recipients already. For sufficiently long-running nodes, in practice this is very often the case. As soon as there is at least one transaction missing, a roundtrip is needed which effectively triples the block relay time on each hop (CMPCTBLOCK-GETBLOCKTXN-BLOCKTXN instead of just CMPCTBLOCK).\r\n\r\nSo generally, adding transactions to your own blocks without even (trying to) relay them to the network is a bad idea for the network, and for the miner personally, as they have an incentive to get their blocks propagated as swiftly as possible to other miners.",
