theuni,2015-05-20T23:48:10Z,"No. I had a misunderstanding about how this works, but I think I finally see:\n- Travis takes the cache from the target branch when the PR is opened\n- When the build completes, a new PR-specific cache is created\n- That cache is used for the life of the PR, presumably so that changes to the main cache don't break it\n\nSo... there's no need to worry about what I was poking at here.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6141#issuecomment-104073493,104073493,
