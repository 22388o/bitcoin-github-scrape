EthanHeilman,2019-12-11 16:04:11,Should we be testing with this flag `--with-incompatible-bdb` set to true? Is there are reason that we can't use the correct version of berkleydb here?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17725#discussion_r356686396,356686396,ci/test/00_setup_env_native_valgrind.sh
MarcoFalke,2019-12-11 18:01:13,"We can use the bdb package from depends or from the Ubuntu package manager. The package manager doesn't come with the bdb version we want, so `--with-incompatible-bdb` is needed. Switching to `./depends` is possible, but shouldn't matter, as we ignore leaks and memory issues in dependencies anyway. They need to be dealt with upstream.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17725#discussion_r356749059,356749059,ci/test/00_setup_env_native_valgrind.sh
