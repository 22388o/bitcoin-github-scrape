Diapolo,2012-07-13T07:18:35Z,"Well I have the impression Bitcoin-Qt is a widely accepted name: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bitcoin-Qt\n\nWe then should define how we want a CLIENT_NAME_QT to be and how we use this one definition all over the Qt version, right?\n\nEdit: This should be used in the Window title, about and so on... currently we have no real standard there.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1592#issuecomment-6956274,6956274,
laanwj,2012-07-13T07:25:31Z,"It's a well-accepted name in developer circles, and it's fine for things such as executable names and internal identifiers.

Diapolo,2012-07-13T08:35:58Z,"@laanwj I have thought about it a little more and I have some suggestions:\n1. Rename Window title to `Bitcoin-Qt - Wallet`\n   -> Bitcoin-Qt is the GUI to Bitcoin and this keeps Wallet but separated by ""-"" to ensure users don't think the client is called ""Bitcoin Wallet"".\n2. Rename `About Bitcoin-Qt` -> `About Bitcoin`\n   -> We show version stuff that is not the Qt client version, but the Bitco",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1592#issuecomment-6957331,6957331,
laanwj,2012-07-13T08:42:29Z,"Yes, good proposal, except for the Qt in the title.\n\nQt in the about box/menu is fine, people will look there to find detailed version information.\n\nAlso note that in the future we'll have the possibility of multiple wallet windows open, as multi-wallet support is introduced.
