MarcoFalke,2020-04-24 23:48:54,"nit: I think you can just set \n```suggestion\n    FastRandomContext rng(/* deterministic */ true);\n```\n\nor is there a reason for the seed?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18754#discussion_r414922897,414922897,src/bench/addrman.cpp
vasild,2020-04-27 09:58:17,"Right, `/* deterministic */ true` would have been better. I will have this in mind and also change this code if I am touching it again.\n\nThere is no need for the chosen seed - it only has to be the same every time to reduce noise in performance tests.\n\nThanks!",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18754#discussion_r415676591,415676591,src/bench/addrman.cpp
