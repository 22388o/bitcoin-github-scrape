It's not related to abandontransaction technically, which was never meant to affect whether or not new coins are considered received, but it is related to whether newly received coins are countable in unconfirmed balance or not based on whether they are in the mempool which changed for 0.12.  It's very difficult, maybe even impossible, to do account balance calculations properly, so I would expect them to just get more unreliable until they finally disappear.

    "body": "> Unfortunately I don't see the situation improving for the account balance calculations\n\nUnfortunately, I don't see so either.\n\nGoing forward on the account deprecation is #7729, which adds a label API. Labels behave almost as accounts do, except that they have no balance. I'd like to include that for 0.13. Then at some later time (possibly 0.14), the old account API, along with everything to do with account balance computation is going to be removed. \n\nThere's not much chance of anyone maintaining it in the mean time - some of the reasons for removing it in the first place are that the code is a mess, no one knows exactly how it behaves (nor should behave), it has some long-running problems, and thus no one wants to maintain it.\n\nAccounts have been marked DEPRECATED since 0.11, and there was talk of doing so far before that. I'd urge you to start working on an implementation that doesn't need them.\n\nIf there is specific functionality that doesn't involve computing balances, but that you feel you cannot achieve without making use of accounts, do let us know (comment in #7729 or so).\n",

    "body": "Thanks @morcos and @laanwj for the analysis on this one. Naturally it's a shame the unconfirmed balance will seemingly always be off, but it's not a showstopper.\n\nThanks also for the estimated timescale for accounts being removed. I'm well aware of the deprecation of this functionality and there is an internal accounting mechanism there. It just needs more testing as it has a few bugs.\n\nUltimately, accounts are used indeed mainly for their balance. It also serves as a last chance emergency stop in case a user tries to send more coins than they have, enforced by bitcoind because the account balance would drop to zero. These can, of course, both be coded for outside of bitcoind, but it's always been nice having this emergency. Issues like this one though do show how the accounting functionality has suffered bit rot though so I understand the need to remove it eventually.\n",
