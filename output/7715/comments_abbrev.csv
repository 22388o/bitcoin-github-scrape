morcos,2016-03-23T17:57:28Z,"@bittylicious Unfortunately I don't see the situation improving for the account balance calculations.  It's not related to abandontransaction technically, which was never meant to affect whether or not new coins are considered received, but it is related to whether newly received coins are countable in unconfirmed balance or not based on whether they are in the mempool which changed for 0.12.

Naturally it's a shame the unconfirmed balance will seemingly always be off, but it's not a showstopper.\n\nThanks also for the estimated timescale for accounts being removed. I'm well aware of the deprecation of this functionality and there is an internal accounting mechanism there. It just needs more testing as it has a few bugs.\n\nUltima",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7715#issuecomment-200855277,200855277,
