The fix at 219 looks okay to me, the asserts should probably changed to typical overflow checking before the operations they're checking, rather than a whirlwind of casts. :)\n\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14223#issuecomment-421537812,421537812,

practicalswift,2018-09-15T17:50:38Z,@gmaxwell Yes agree it looks weird a bit weird together with the old `assert(…)`. Your suggestion to go with typical overflow checking is better. I don't know the rationale behind that `assert(…)`: I'll have to dig in the repo and GitHub history too see. Closing this PR for now :-)  I'll revisit when I have prepared a better solution which also gets rid of that old assert.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14223#issuecomment-421606921,421606921,
arvidn,2018-09-15T16:52:18Z,"could you explain what you're doing here?\nI get the impression that you intend to make it so that (unintended) unsigned wraparound do not happen. I don't think it's obvious how these casts help with that. Is `modifySize` legitimately negative sometimes? and is `nSizeWithDescendants` legitimately near `INT64_MAX` as a result?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14223#discussion_r217889715,217889715,src/txmempool.cpp
practicalswift,2018-09-15T17:54:26Z,"@arvidn Yes `modifySize` can be legitimately negative. Actually that condition and the resulting wraparound is trigged just by running the ordinary test suite:\n\n```\n$ ./configure --with-sanitizers=integer && \\n    make check && \\n    test/functional/test_runner.py\n…\ntxmempool.cpp:308:26: runtime error: unsigned integer overflow: 223 + 18446744073709551532 cannot be represented in typ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14223#discussion_r217891322,217891322,src/txmempool.cpp
