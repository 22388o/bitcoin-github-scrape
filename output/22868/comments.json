    "body": "PR description doesn't seem totally accurate, from https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22868#issue-987214408\r\n\r\n> Don't have `cs_wallet` locked while calling each `context.wallet_load_fns`. A load handler can always lock `cs_wallet` if needed.\r\n> \r\n> The lock was added in [1c7e25d](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/1c7e25db0c898abc9968ab487b254454b709e628) to satisfy TSAN. With [44c430f](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/44c430ffac940e1d1dd7f5939a495470bc694489) most of the code requiring the lock is in `CWallet::AttachChain`. A comment is added to warn about wallets_mutex and cs_wallet lock ordering.\r\n\r\nIf my understanding of https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11634/files#r227725517 is correct, then the lock was not added to satsify TSAN but was added to satisfy clang annotations. I think you could summarize this by saying that this LOCK(cs_wallet) was correctly added in #11634, but it became no longer unnecessary after #20773 when code requiring the lock was moved to the new `AttachChain` method. \r\n\r\nAlso it now seems like the motivation for this change is not just removing an unnecessary lock, but reversing the 1. cs_wallet 2. wallets_mutex lock order so it can now be 1. wallets_mutex 2. cs_wallet, because upcoming GUI PR https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/pull/417 needs this",
