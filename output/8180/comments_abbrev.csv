MarcoFalke,2016-06-09T08:22:25Z,"As you set an expiration date, wouldn't that encourage people with your key\nto fetch an update whenever it timrs out?\n\nIf you still think bumping makes sense, I'd prefed to have all keys bumped.\n(E.g. I have set my key to expire before every major release)\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8180#issuecomment-224830201,224830201,
laanwj,2016-06-09T08:45:37Z,It's really up to him when he wants to bump his key's expiration date (I don't think it's so much bound to bitcoin core releases).\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8180#issuecomment-224835205,224835205,
MarcoFalke,2016-06-09T09:17:40Z,"Oh, I was referring to bumping (updating) the keys in this repo. If one\nperson just updates all keys, the review overhead is the smallest.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8180#issuecomment-224842301,224842301,
laanwj,2016-06-09T09:22:27Z,"You can only update the expiration date on your own key.\n\nBut I suppose you mean re-retrieving all the keys from the keyserver and pushing them (if the expiration date changed - I suppose we don't care about signatures here), that could certainly work.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8180#issuecomment-224843359,224843359,
MarcoFalke,2016-06-09T09:34:06Z,Exactly.\n\nI think writing a script to fetch all gitian-keys shouldn't be too hard.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8180#issuecomment-224845903,224845903,
