    "body": "@NanoAkron, to be clear, the goal here is not to restrict transactions.  I wish the 2.6% number was 0.0%.  Nor is the goal to prevent any specific type or kind of transaction, spam or otherwise.   The goal is only to prevent particularly constructed chains of transactions which would serve to break critical functionality of the network.  Such chains are only likely constructed for the particular purpose of attacking the entire Bitcoin system, however, the limits proposed to prevent these attacks may inadvertently restrict non-attack transactions.   I'm just trying to be as transparent as possible by acknowledging that 2.6% of recent transactions would either have to have been delayed until some of their ancestors were included in blocks or constructed from different utxos if these limits had already been in place.\n",

    "body": "We, at Serica and DigitalTangible actively use unspent tx chains to allow our customers to speed their bitcoin user-experience without the need for them to wait on blockchain confirmations. These transactions are usually sequential and must happen between our customers and our marketplace of merchants and other customers. For example, a user agrees to place an order to purchase bitcoin and then make a bitcoin payment, for a product or services, with that bitcoin, should their desired price be met while they are unable to actively monitor their transaction.\n\nWe currently do not have a need to chain more than 5 unspents given our current use cases for onboarding new customers into the bitcoin ecosystem. Given this PR, we agree with its principle, since the proposal aims to limit to MAX_ANCESTORS = 25 and MAX_DESCENDANTS = 25, which we think is reasonable. We have not **yet** seen a use case for more than 25 chains of unconfirmed in our ecosystem.\n\nHowever, we would like to publish our viewpoint that we wish to avoid a slippery slope of restrictions in unspents to fall from from 25 to 2 or even 0. The limits imposed should not prevent, at minimum, 5 step chains of transactions that are needed to give a customer temporary control over funds that they would otherwise not have access to unless they waited for a confirmation before conducting another transaction. In these situations, where an instant purchase must be made with customer control, that btc must be sent to a customers address and then be quickly relayed to a merchant or another party in a transaction to create a seamless experience. All of this must happen within 0 confs because our customers will not wait for a whole confirm and we do not wish to lose the opportunity to make Bitcoin more available and useful to a broader audience with higher performance demands. \n\nZero confirmations, when done properly, help increase adoption of Bitcoin and make it more competitive against other forms of payments. However, we do think it's good to prevent abuse of the system with reasonable constraints for the current ecosystem of applications and wallets. \n",

There are attacks which can cause the mempools of full nodes to become almost permanently unusuable, which would prevent transaction relay and basically bring the network to a halt.  How low we have to make these limits to prevent that may not be an exact science.   The good thing is that if we do decide to start with a higher limit than 25, and these attacks are seen in the wild, its only a command line argument to change it.  But as we've seen with the minimum relay fee and the stress tests, its still an issue if people have to bring down their nodes and restart them with different parameters to respond to the attack.\n",

Also, This PR doesn't touch the release notes to educate users about the change and possible issues (and how to solve them). This is yet another instance of the too broad and misleading \"-4 error message\" [1]. Abusing the mempool to reject transactions created by the wallet is the wrong way to go. If there is an issue how the wallet creates transactions, this should be tackled instead. However, the wallet already prefers confirmed inputs. If there are no confirmed inputs but only unconfirmed change there is nothing wrong about the transaction and the mempool should not intervene.\n\n[1]: `Error: The transaction was rejected! This might happen if some of the coins in your wallet were already spent, such as if you used a copy of wallet.dat and coins were spent in the copy but not marked as spent here. (code -4)`\n",

Very powerful nodes can still be attacked if they have a mempool with some size limit.\n\nI do agree that better wallet UI is needed, but that problem is not introduced by this pull.\n\nIf we don't make the default small enough to be safe, then most people will have to configure their own policy.

Completely independent of taariq's use case, but similar in that chains of txs are created and submitted to the mempool together without waiting for sequential block confirmation of each tx in the chain.\n\nDue to signature constraints, our multiple steps cannot be coalesced into a single transaction for publication. (Coalescing could be possible with improvements to sigHash capabilities) Therefore, we end up with multiple transactions in a chain which are all submitted to the peer network together.\n\nIn our current implementation, these chains can be 3 to 4 levels deep per \"user transaction\".  However, if the blockchain is taking 20 minutes to  produce the next block, a user initiating multiple \"user transactions\" (buy x, then buy y, then buy z) in that 20 minutes could build on that unspent chain.  The additional operations are not strictly linear - subsequent operations would spend the change outputs of the previous operation's root transaction, forming a tree of chained txs.  A set of 3 operations would form a tree with a max depth of 7 and a total node count of 12.\n\nThe \"sendmany\" RPC function is of no use to me because it only works within the limits of the reference implementation wallet - single signature outputs. Our system is built on multisignature wallets. We run off-the-shelf bitcoind full nodes, but we never use the wallet or address functions.\n",

But yes, if there is too much resistance to 25/25, we might have to start with higher limits.  I think node performance should be reasonable with 50/100 but I worry about attacks.  Maybe there is some middle ground where some nodes run with higher limits and some lower.  Highly chained txs would only be relayed through the nodes with higher limits, but in the event of the attack the lower limit nodes would keep relay open for the vast majority of txs.\n",

Not so much to entirely replace the tx chains we have, but to reduce the number of outputs necessary to pay network fees across the chain, and improve the all-or-none granularity of the tx set for inclusion in a block.\n\nI gave a slightly more specific example of my use case on the bitcoin-dev list a few weeks ago: http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-August/010569.html   Basically, a brokered escrow transaction involving 3 parties where the seller and the buyer never communicate directly.\n\nYes, I am aware of and concerned about transaction maleability. I'm counting on BIP62 to significantly reduce that risk. I believe the txs we generate are already BIP62 compliant. We also compute a signature-free hash of every transaction as an alternate txid so that we can at least recognize our txs in the blockchain even if their scripts have been tweaked in transit. Any issued txs downstream from that altered tx would have to be redone, of course, which is a pain in the neck and extremely inconvenient to all involved.\n",

If so, it seems like a trade off, and it may result in situations where a lot of unspent outputs are prepared, just to have some available.\n\nI can imagine that the reduction of the package/chain size might be useful, but I'm wondering, if there is any indication that it really solves, or would have mitigated the previous/ongoing/potential mempool bloat [in the future]?\n",

    "body": "> Indeed the only reason to relay chains of unconfirmed transactions is CPFP.\n\nCertainly, CPFP would provide great benefits for asynchronous brokered exchange scenarios (A => B => C as a pseudo \"atomic\" set of transactions), but until CPFP is actually deployed and usable (and/or sigHash allows merging of independent fully signed txs), we're stuck with more primitive techniques such as zero-conf spending chains.\n\nAnd even if/when CPFP is available for general use, why would that indicate that the tx chain limit should be much lower than 25?  If anything, availability of CPFP would likely encourage use of such pseudo atomic transaction sets.\n\nFrankly, I feel support for some form of merging signed transactions into an atomic blob would be a better solution for my use case than CPFP, providing true atomicity by coalescing all actors into one bitcoin transaction.  Until something along those lines can be sorted out, we work with what is available (and complain loudly at every opportunity! :> )\n",

    "body": "@dthorpe Didn't see your above comment until now \"I'm counting on BIP62 to significantly reduce that risk.\"  BIP62 cannot remove malleability from multisignature transactions; and I believe it is unlikely that BIP62 will ever be deployed on the Bitcoin network due to it's invasiveness and necessary incompleteness. (Well, pedantically, BIP62 as is will not be deployed as its outdated; a revised version could be, but I'm doubtful of it due to the limitations in the approach). Though I'm hopeful about more complete things being done in the future, they wouldn't be BIP62.  I bring it up not to invite a debate over it, but just to level set-- you shouldn't be expecting anything to just happen there.\n",

    "body": "Since you were struggling to find legitimate usecases, I'd like to contribute to the conversation that in Wasabi Wallet's coinjoin chains I'm starting to hit these limits in various ways.  \r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\nBefore I discuss the limits individually I'd like to provide some background:\r\n\r\nWasabi launched 3 months ago and the coinjoin volume is exponentially growing since then. An average Wasabi CJ today is `4 kB` vsize. There are 37 participants in each round and 10-20-ish rounds happen daily. Usually peers only submit 1-2 inputs, I allow a maximum of 7 inputs. I use fee target 144, this seems to result in the less \"too high fees and too slow confirmations\" complains.  \r\nI only allow unconfirmed coinjoin outputs to be registered for a round. This is a sanity check. There are way too many things to consider what unconfirmed transactions I should let in if I'd want to extend this to various unconfirmed utxos. While I plan to allow the registration of unconfirmed utxos, it's unlikely I'll do that in the near future. \r\nAnyway, whenever a limit here is hit, I refuse the registration of the unconfirmed transaction.\r\n\r\n## Individual Limit Discussions\r\n\r\n- `DEFAULT_ANCESTOR_LIMIT = 25;` I did not hit this limit yet. While as rounds get faster, I'll hit it more and more often, I don't mind this much. I need a sanity check on how large unconfirmed CJ chain I want to build at max anyway. \r\n- `DEFAULT_ANCESTOR_SIZE_LIMIT = 101;` I did not hit this limit yet. As more and more peers get to participate, it'll be hit faster and faster. For example a 100 participant transaction would cost 15-20kB. This means I'll have to have a chain with about 5 transactions at max. And this assumes that users will only register 1-2 inputs.\r\n- `DEFAULT_DESCENDANT_LIMIT = 25` and `DEFAULT_DESCENDANT_SIZE_LIMIT = 101`. These are the real pain points for me, since I have no control over it. I know at registration that no user can create more ancestors, but I cannot control if they create descendants or not in later phases, resulting the final transaction to fail. `DEFAULT_DESCENDANT_LIMIT` was is being hit already.\r\n\r\n## Question\r\n\r\nAlso it is not clear to me if the descendant limits apply to the sum of all descendants of all inputs's prevouts or just individual descendants of each input's prevout. The error message seems to imply the latter \"too many descendants for tx ...\" Which one is it?",
