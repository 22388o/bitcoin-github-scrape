laanwj,2017-12-17T11:19:20Z,"Don't use the word 'bug' like that, please. It's certainly possible to have a bug in a text message or documentation when it explains things wrong, and sometimes those are serious bugs that can result in coin loss.\nHowever, this is not one of such.\nYou're welcome to improve messages if they're unclear, though!",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11920#issuecomment-352248479,352248479,
comradekingu,2017-12-17T14:02:05Z,"@laanqj My apologies. Adjusting for clarity in strings other than this leaves a whole lot less room for misunderstandings, making for fewer errors in translation.
