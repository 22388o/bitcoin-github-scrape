danra,2017-08-31T20:53:49Z,"@MarcoFalke I don't mind doing this project-wide where appropriate, but I'd appreciate pointers to the files where it would be relevant. I believe it would make sense to constexpr-ize conceptual things which it would make sense to test or express more complex concepts at compile time.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11205#issuecomment-326417793,326417793,

MarcoFalke,2017-09-05T22:21:09Z,"Agree with @laanwj. This is obviously an improvement, but I fail to see the rationale to do this refactoring only in this specific file. This will just cause a bunch of ""Make constexpr"" commits over the next couple of months.\n\nEither do a scripted diff for the whole project if people agree to do that or leave it until there is an actual use case.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11205#issuecomment-327320188,327320188,
