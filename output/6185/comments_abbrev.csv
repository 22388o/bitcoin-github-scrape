jonasschnelli,2015-05-25T19:41:48Z,This is not so one-linerish. My cleverness is limited. I hope someone finds the time to do this nicer.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6185#discussion_r30992573,30992573,src/netbase.cpp
laanwj,2015-05-26T05:48:31Z,So to be clear: these tests fail without this change?\nI doubt you need as many changes to fix this. Particularly the change to `match` appears unnecessarily complex. It is not simply a matter of bitwise AND-ing the `addr` with `netmask` after parsing?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6185#discussion_r31005882,31005882,src/test/netbase_tests.cpp
laanwj,2015-05-26T06:34:04Z,Trying a different take on this\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6185#discussion_r31007375,31007375,src/netbase.cpp
