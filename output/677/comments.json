If you want to make it easier for miners to customize fee schedule (which should absolutely be done), you also have to make sure the customization options still (attempt to) force the miners to keep the original incentivization (dont think thats a word...) structure or you risk issues like the downward-spiraling fee issue.\nSo until someone makes a nice fee algorithm, I would have to vote strongly against anything which allows for easier fee customization.\n",
