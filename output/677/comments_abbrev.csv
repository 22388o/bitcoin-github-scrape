luke-jr,2011-12-03T03:51:37Z,"This change was discussed in #bitcoin-dev during the 0.3.22 release cycle. At least BlueMatt and ArtForz supported it, and jrmithdobbs recommended using an enum instead (it was an int at the time). Since we were at rc5 at the time, sipa wanted to stick with his boolean-only rewrite temporarily and wait to merge this for 0.3.23.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/677#issuecomment-2998932,2998932,
TheBlueMatt,2011-12-05T18:52:34Z,"Although allowing users to easily do whatever they want for fees is nice, its really not the way to go.  If you want to make it easier for miners to customize fee schedule (which should absolutely be done), you also have to make sure the customization options still (attempt to) force the miners to keep the original incentivization (dont think thats a word...) structure or you risk issues like the ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/677#issuecomment-3021141,3021141,

realsolid,2011-12-06T07:45:16Z,You can't really have custom fees in a client unless you propagate _ALL_ transactions by default. Otherwise transactions are going to be firewalled by the nodes which don't accept them. There are currently rules by which transactions are propagated so I can't see how custom fees can be enabled by miners.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/677#issuecomment-3029215,3029215,
