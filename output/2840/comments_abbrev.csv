Diapolo,2013-08-17T12:03:43Z,Does this make the code more stable or is it a performance-improving patch? That locking stuff isn't my main expertise ^^.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2840#issuecomment-22810513,22810513,
sipa,2013-08-18T00:22:07Z,"@Diapolo It improves performance/throughput, by allowing more code to run without needing the cs_main lock, and conversely, holding that lock for a shorter time, so more other code can run in parallel.\n\nAt this point the improvements may not be noticable, but if we ever want a decently parallellizable core, we can't avoid doing this everywhere it's possible.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2840#issuecomment-22822345,22822345,
