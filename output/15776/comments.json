    "body": "That seems like a potentially very bad bug.  However at first glance I don't see how `fPauseSend` could be implicated as a trigger; I don't believe we ever drop requests on the floor if the send buffer fills up, we just wait until the buffer drains and then continue as before. \r\n\r\nActually, I realize now that one way this could maybe trigger is if our peer sends a NOTFOUND in response to a getdata, I don't think we would reduce the in flight count (I think this is fixed in #15505 but this seems like a bug in 0.18).  So over time, as NOTFOUND's pile up, the in-flight queue would get full and we'd stop requesting transactions.  So we should definitely take some kind of fix for this, yikes.",

If all your peers do that (for whatever reason) you're not going to gain txn, regardless of what happens with this.  So this fix only helps the case where a peer is randomly responding to some getdatas.\r\n\r\nThe fact that we'd stop asking for data from peers if they were not responding wasn't lost on me in the original changes, but this seemed like a good thing (I can't caught the notfound interaction, either through just missing it or due to havign 15505 on the brain).",

    "body": "I think we should do two things:\r\n(a) Fix the bug in NOTFOUND processing -- if a peer sends a NOTFOUND for a transaction, we should remove it from the in-flight map for that peer.  I think we should definitely do this and backport to 0.18.\r\n\r\n(b) As a safeguard, we should also do something if a peer's in-flight count hits the max so that we're not downloading new transactions from them.  I think there are two responses that make sense to me: either we eventually disconnect them, or we expire the in-flight entry and make room for a new request.  For 0.18,  I think expiry makes more sense, as it's more robust to other bugs that may be lurking in this new code.  Eventually, I think disconnection is where I expect things to go in the long-run (which is what we do for block getdata's that are dropped by the peer).\r\n\r\nAlso, I think I spotted another bug in this code related to emptying out the tx_in_flight set -- if a different peer serves us a transaction that we requested from another, then the entry doesn't get removed (upon receiving a TX message, we only erase from the delivering peer's in_flight set).  So a \"DoS\"er that helpfully blasted us with transactions would be able to blind us to transactions from our other peers.  The expiry solution would mitigate this, which is a point in its favor for merging into 0.18, but we should fix this too I think if we can do so easily.",

    "body": "> Scenario is likely: Alice sends Bob and INV for a new tx, Bob sends GETDATA for the tx, Alice responds with TX, Bob doesn't have the parent so sends GETDATA for the parent, adding it to the tx_in_flight set, Alice replies NOTFOUND due to the parent having expired from the relay set due to being in the mempool for over 15 minutes, so Bob doesn't remove the entry from the tx_in_flight set.\r\n\r\nI added logging for when my node sends a notfound to try and see what the reasons were. It looks like most of the time these are for tx's that aren't even in my mempool at all anymore, though that varies between peers:\r\n\r\n * peer=0 -- 2821 not in mempool, 0 in mempool\r\n * peer=3 -- 1495 not in mempool, 0 in mempool\r\n * peer=1 -- 1092 not in mempool, 0 in mempool\r\n\r\n * peer=5 -- 401 not in mempool, 117 in mempool\r\n * peer=4 -- 308 not in mempool, 0 in mempool\r\n * peer=2 -- 146 not in mempool, 0 in mempool\r\n\r\n * peer=102 -- 73 in mempool, 14 not in mempool\r\n * peer=204 -- 111 in mempool, 3 not in mempool\r\n\r\nFor the ones that are in the mempool, the times are all just >15m as expected (ranging from 902s to 17432s -- almost 5 hours), and the parent explanation seems fine for them.\r\n\r\nNot sure what's causing other nodes to request tx's that aren't in my mempool anymore though.

    "body": "> I presume you are using self-made logging, since I couldn't find that logprint in the code base?\r\n\r\nYeah, it's just\r\n\r\n    +                auto txinfo = mempool.info(inv.hash);\r\n    +                LogPrint(BCLog::NET, \"will send notfound for: %s %ds in mempool peer=%d\\n\", inv.hash.ToString(), (txinfo.tx ? GetTime() - txinfo.nTime : -1), pfrom->GetId());\r\n\r\nbefore `vNotFound.push_back(inv);` in `ProcessGetData()`.\r\n \r\n> Also, I can't follow how the mempool should influence getdata at all. We are using `mapRelay` to store the transaction pointers and it is populated at the same time the inv gets sent. (Of course a timeout of an entry in `mapRelay` might cause the issue mentioned here, but that shouldn't occur so frequently)\r\n\r\nYeah -- if it hasn't expired from `mapRelay` it should be fine, I'm trying to understand why a getdata is being sent after expiry from `mapRelay`. Apparently that's almost always when it's also been removed from the mempool.\r\n\r\nAh! I think what's happening is I'm getting a tx A, which spends B and C, and `AcceptToMemoryPool` is noticing I don't have B and setting `fMissingInputs` to true, at which point I'm doing `RequestTx` for both B and C, because `AlreadyHave(C)` returns false for both because they're not in the mempool, and **because B's first two outputs aren't in the UTXO set** it doesn't notice that I have C via the UTXO set. (EDIT to add bolded text)\r\n\r\nSo the cases where I'm sending `getdata` and getting back `notfound` seem to me to be:\r\n\r\n * I'm unnecessarily requesting tx data I already have, because I don't have some other parent of a tx I just received (most of the time)\r\n * My peer isn't forwarding me a parent that's still in the mempool but has expired from `mapRelayTx` (rarely, but non-zero)\r\n",
