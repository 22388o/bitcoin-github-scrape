groffer,2011-08-02T22:03:04Z,CheckBlock calls this function.  Won't this cause a fork in the blockchain if the network doesn't upgrade as a whole and a transaction that runs afoul of this check is included in a block?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/443#issuecomment-1713600,1713600,

Im assuming there is a check somewhere later on that prevented them from getting added to a block, though I haven't done any diggin",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/443#issuecomment-1713684,1713684,
