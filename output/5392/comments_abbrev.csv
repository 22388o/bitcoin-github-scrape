mruddy,2014-11-29T13:28:31Z,"Thanks for the feedback.\n\n#5264 was a change to decode the scriptSig signature hash types.\n\nThe reason for making this set of ""OP_"" changes at the same time was to break any dependencies on the output pretty clearly. Helping readability by reducing the ""OP_"" redundancy was a secondary goal.\n\nI think the growing consensus from the #5264 discussion is that no guarantees to hold these outputs c",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5392#issuecomment-64951806,64951806,
laanwj,2014-12-01T09:27:47Z,"@thebluematt The rationale for this is that as #5264 changes the asm syntax to add (...) comments, which will break current parsers anyhow, a cleanup like removing OP_ can be done at the same time.\n\nSo I'm fine with this if it is decided to merge that pull.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5392#issuecomment-65038764,65038764,

mruddy,2014-12-08T16:18:32Z,"Prefixes or not, the added value is in the new unit tests that firm up the format. I'd be just as happy to remove my changes that remove the ""OP_"" prefixes if doing that will get the new unit tests merged (and I'll update them to verify that the ""OP_"" prefixes are there).
