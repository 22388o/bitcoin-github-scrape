    "body": "Thanks for the feedback.\n\n#5264 was a change to decode the scriptSig signature hash types.\n\nThe reason for making this set of \"OP_\" changes at the same time was to break any dependencies on the output pretty clearly. Helping readability by reducing the \"OP_\" redundancy was a secondary goal.\n\nI think the growing consensus from the #5264 discussion is that no guarantees to hold these outputs constant have been made. As these changes are made, more unit tests are being added which will firm up these output formats and increase support for those that do want to script against them in the future.\n\nSo, that's at least why this set of changes was put forward.\n",

Please let me know if I should do that.\n\nThis is also about consistency in the \"asm\" outputs.\nWhen I worked pull request #5264 to resolve issue #3166, I originally had the \"SIGHASH_\" prefixes.\nThe feedback was to remove those prefixes.\nThen some more feedback came in saying to create this pull request removing the \"OP_\" prefixes too.\n\n@TheBlueMatt could you comment on #5264 about if you like that change or not (#5264 adds SIGHASH decodes to the \"asm\" outputs)?
