jgarzik,2014-09-15T01:46:00Z,"ut ACK\n\nHowever, I will note a minor concern (technical debt).  Now that this message is enabled unconditionally, a non-debug configuration might spew more data to log than wanted during an attack.\n\nThis seems like the sort of thing I could see rate-limiting in the future.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4848#issuecomment-55546748,55546748,

Sometimes it is acceptable to increase technical debt, but only for important things that _have_ to be fixed asap. Not for some silly logging change.
