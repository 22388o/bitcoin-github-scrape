laanwj,2019-01-04T10:26:57Z,"> This removes the 250ms minimal delta for header updates as well as it fixes the correct display of how header updates should update the labels.\n\nThe delta is there to prevent a flood of GUI update messages. I don't removing it is a good solution, we should take care that *one* update makes it per 250ms though.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15091#issuecomment-451407356,451407356,

This PR only removes the delay-update for header updates... which IMO should not result in GUI flood. AFAIK the GUI flood only gets problematic on chain tip updates.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15091#issuecomment-451533111,451533111,
