jnewbery,2017-04-17T18:43:27Z,@paveljanik the idea is for the characters to be as distinct as possible so it's easy to scan down the list and quickly see if there's a line with a different character (the glyphs were originally added for monochrome terminals where text coloring doesn't help). Small v is too similar to small x.,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10222#issuecomment-294556055,294556055,
paveljanik,2017-04-17T18:46:40Z,"@jnewbery Fair enough. But P is almost similar to o... In this regard, I think that ""v"" is much better (and it is also similar to ""âœ“"").",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10222#issuecomment-294556877,294556877,

jnewbery,2017-04-18T13:36:58Z,"@paveljanik thanks for taking the time to think about and review this. I see your point about o/P being similar, but I really think that they're more distinguishable than x/v. I'm also more interested in the symbol for failure being distinguishable from the symbol for success. The times this is most useful is when there's a list of succeeding test cases with one or a few failing test cases, so the",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10222#issuecomment-294846559,294846559,
