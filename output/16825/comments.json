    "body": "Right, a few notes:\r\n\r\na) Probably should swap this to make the initial connections bias a bit towards Tor instead of only doing it at the end, to ensure connections come up quick, also worth discussing whether they should be non-blocks-only.\r\n\r\nb) Indeed, Tor is very sybil'able, though our slight bias towards older nodes (thanks to feelers) helps with that, the goal would more be to force any attacker trying to do addr-flooding-based sybil attacks to do so in multiple ways, and any miscalculations in any of them would result in failure (though, really, a more likely scenario is just having a target who doesn't have Tor, resulting in less collateral damage for such an attack). I agree its only a somewhat marginal benefit, but I wouldn't discount it completely (assuming my understanding of the likelyhood of finding Tor peers by default is correct, which may not be....).\r\n\r\nc) I agree Tor listening sockets may be limited, hopefully the bump to 150 helps. Anecdotally, my Tor-listening nodes don't appear to get any more connections over Tor than normal IP, in fact much, much less.",

A few ideas going forward here include: (a) using the blocks-over-REST/HTTP module in Rust to fetch over Tor, (b) same with headers-over-DNS, (c) quickly rotating through a huge set of known Tor hidden services to find any peers that have some blocks which you do not as more of a fallback mechanism in case of successful Eclipse attack(s).",
