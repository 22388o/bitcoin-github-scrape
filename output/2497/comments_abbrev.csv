Diapolo,2013-04-10T10:49:47Z,"ACK\n\nEdit: @laanwj Is there any chance we could include this new testnet icon into bitcoin-qt.exe? I know the mainnet icon is embedded, but to have both would be really nice.\n\nEdit 2: Ah this is happening in bitcoin-qt.rc. So @jonasschnelli Could you integrate a bitcoin_testnet.ico into this pull :)?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2497#issuecomment-16167134,16167134,
laanwj,2013-04-10T10:59:08Z,"ACK\n\n@diapolo would make sense, I suppose, as the other icon could be selected\nfor shortcuts that start testnet.\n\nI don't think it is necessary for this pull though. It's extra\nfunctionality that wasn't there before.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2497#issuecomment-16167517,16167517,

jonasschnelli,2013-04-10T12:44:08Z,also added a new windows ico file (better quality for <256px resolutions). Reported by Diapolo (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2477#issuecomment-16167568)\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2497#issuecomment-16171640,16171640,
Diapolo,2013-04-10T13:13:16Z,Thanks for looking into this :). Are you able to also create a bitcoin_testnet.ico (as mentioned above)?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2497#issuecomment-16173074,16173074,
jonasschnelli,2013-04-10T13:14:57Z,Yes. Can do. But currently the icon is changed by QT with a 256x256px PNG replacement. Would you then change the code to support ICO files? Or is the 256x256 PNG testnet file not in appropriate quality?\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2497#issuecomment-16173158,16173158,
Diapolo,2013-04-10T13:22:28Z,I'm talking about the icon file Windows is using to display when using shortcuts and the one the bitcoin-qt.exe is using. The code is here in the ressource file:\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/qt/res/bitcoin-qt.rc#L1\n\nDunno if this supports png files.\n\nEdit: It seems the bitcoin.png is JUST used 2 times in bitcoingui.cpp via `:icons/bitcoin` (see file bitcoin.qrc)!\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2497#issuecomment-16173551,16173551,
jonasschnelli,2013-04-10T13:28:21Z,"Hmm.. i hope i still see through. :)\nThe file ""icons/bitcoin.ico"" is updated (multi-resolution ICO file) and looks fine if it comes to the render of the .exe file as well as of the shortcut version (48x48).\nCurrently there is no bitcoin_testnet.ico and as far as i can see (in the Windows land) theres no code or buld-process script using a such bitcoin_testnet.ico.\n\nBut i can just create you a ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2497#issuecomment-16173892,16173892,
