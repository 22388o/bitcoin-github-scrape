jnewbery,2018-03-28T19:40:29Z,"ok. I've thought about this some more, and changed the approach. Rather than trying three times and hoping that there'll be equality at some point, I'm now calling `getnettotals` before and after `getpeerinfo` and asserting that the info returned by `getpeerinfo` is bounded above and below by the totals in `getnettotals`. I've also changed some equality tests below to inequality tests, for the sam",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12804#issuecomment-377010689,377010689,

I assume this changes the likelihood of failure significantly lower, but I am curious if in the case where the first try fails, might the second also be likely to fail for whatever reason.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12804#discussion_r177723388,177723388,test/functional/rpc_net.py
