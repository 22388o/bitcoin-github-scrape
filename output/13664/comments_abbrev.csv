masonicboom,2018-07-16T01:32:13Z,"Ok. I restricted the script to only touch files in version control.\n\nIf someone could point me to a reference on the scripted diff concept I would appreciate it. I'm curious what it buys us in this case.\n\nHere's a test plan:\n1. pull changes\n2. build\n3. `src/bitcoind --help | grep ""share/rpcuser""` comes up empty.\n4. `src/bitcoind --help | grep ""share/rpcauth""` produces:\n\n       ",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13664#issuecomment-405133407,405133407,
