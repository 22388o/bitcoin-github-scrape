robot-dreams,2021-01-05 00:35:25,"Thanks for working on this!\n\nYes, I agree that `hash_stop` is something we might consider checking. However, I'm worried that because most of the time calls to `getheaders` pass a `hash_stop` value of 0 (to indicate ""get as many blocks as possible"") rather than a specific block's hash value, replacing the existing logic with a `hash_stop` check might not actually make the tests more robust.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18838#issuecomment-754310754,754310754,
