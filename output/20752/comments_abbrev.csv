MarcoFalke,2020-12-23 07:35:10,"It was nice to be able to put the `while true` outside the script. The benefit was that the outside could update this script, the code repo, as well as the seeds repo. This allows continuous fuzzing of the master branch with the latest code and seeds while atomically updating the build system and this script.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20752#discussion_r547756550,547756550,test/fuzz/test_runner.py

MarcoFalke,2020-12-28 07:44:28,"That would complicate the outside script because it had to poll for changes in the repo, while running the fuzzer script.

sipa,2020-12-28 07:49:24,"It's not so much the while True I like, but the fact that this doesn't leave cores unused after most of the jobs are done. Doing it randomly also more easily accommodates adding more configurations (which presumably would hurt your workflow equally much, as every new combination would multiply the time between checks by some factor).\n\nWhat about adding an option to make this automatically exit a",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20752#discussion_r549248791,549248791,test/fuzz/test_runner.py
