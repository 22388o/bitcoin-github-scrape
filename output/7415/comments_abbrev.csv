PRabahy,2016-01-27T00:51:29Z,"I'm still not on the list. :( I have been running a node consistently at 68.34.102.231 for quite a while. I did a little investigation back in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6333 and found that it was probably something to do with IPv6, so I have been running onlynet=ipv4. http://bitcoin.sipa.be/seeds.txt shows my node at almost 100% up-time.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7415#issuecomment-175317624,175317624,

PRabahy,2016-01-27T03:05:11Z,"My motivation is to make sure that the list of hardcoded seeds is accurate. For the 1 data point that I have direct knowledge of (my own node), it does not appear that the list is accurate. If I was interested in attacking the bitcoin network, there would be much more effective ways that getting my node on this list.\n\nEither way, I manually verified about a dozen of the nodes on the new list and",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7415#issuecomment-175361111,175361111,

laanwj,2016-01-27T09:13:15Z,"@PRabahy I have no idea why you're not listed, but if it appears in seeds.txt it should be straightforward to trace it through the `makeseeds.py` script and see which filter pass ""eats"" it.\n(and maybe correct the script if you think it does so for no good reason)\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7415#issuecomment-175500484,175500484,
