laanwj,2012-02-25T19:28:49Z,"Hmm, as this has pretty significant changes, I think we should leave this for 0.7.0, and try it out a bit ourselves first.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/890#issuecomment-4175425,4175425,
gavinandresen,2012-02-25T21:34:45Z,If (a rebased version of) this isn't pulled for 0.6 then another fix for #815 (UpNP settings don't stick) is needed-- trying to fix that bug is what led me to pull my hair out and decide the whole settings system needed to be overhauled.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/890#issuecomment-4176367,4176367,
laanwj,2012-02-25T21:46:10Z,"ok, in that case it's fine with me to add it for 0.6.0 already\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/890#issuecomment-4176470,4176470,

sipa,2012-02-25T22:57:55Z,"Does this mean that when settings are present in bitcoin.conf that are also set in the Qt settings, the ones from bitcoin.conf are used, but when trying to modify them, they go to Qt settings, where they are ignored?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/890#discussion_r489051,489051,src/qt/optionsmodel.cpp
sipa,2012-02-25T23:00:59Z,"I'd prefer the type-prefixes from Bitcoin's coding style not to be used in the setting-names, but that's a detail :)\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/890#discussion_r489054,489054,src/qt/optionsmodel.cpp
laanwj,2012-02-26T07:04:44Z,"Wouldn't that append the port? It only wants the IP here, port is separate.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/890#discussion_r489265,489265,src/qt/optionsmodel.cpp
laanwj,2012-02-26T07:16:35Z,"That's on purpose, the settings in bitcoin.conf and the command line _always_ override settings in the UI. However, if you change them later on in the UI, they will end up in the QSettings as normal.  Which are overridden again on next start, **if** the user keeps them in the configuration file/command line.\n\nI think that is the right behavior, as only advanced users will change bitcoin.conf and",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/890#discussion_r489268,489268,src/qt/optionsmodel.cpp
laanwj,2012-02-26T07:27:39Z,That was my first though too -- but then I saw that option names would have to be re-mapped in the migration process from wallet.dat. Let's keep it simple :)\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/890#discussion_r489271,489271,src/qt/optionsmodel.cpp
sipa,2012-02-26T13:33:42Z,"Hmm, yes it would. Still, the proxy port doesn't seem to get saved to the file?\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/890#discussion_r489370,489370,src/qt/optionsmodel.cpp
sipa,2012-02-26T13:34:51Z,"True, in most cases that is the expected behaviour. Still, it could be very confusing at some point.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/890#discussion_r489371,489371,src/qt/optionsmodel.cpp
