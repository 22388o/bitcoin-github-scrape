Altoidnerd,2014-04-16T17:51:30Z,/bitcoin-qt: error while loading shared libraries: libdb_cxx-4.8.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\n\nI have received this error message from time to time.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4056#issuecomment-40630251,40630251,
sipa,2014-04-16T17:54:00Z,@Altoidnerd That means you don't have db_cxx 4.8 installed. That has nothing to do with this PR.\n,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4056#issuecomment-40630556,40630556,
