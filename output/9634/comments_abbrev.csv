TheBlueMatt,2017-01-26T01:00:24Z,"I had a reason why I needed to check that a transaction was one, only one, and exactly one transaction when writing some stuff that used RPC to do transaction manipulation, but, honestly I cant remember what it was now....anyway, still like this change.\n\nutACK f1c7bad08e299b8a686c4f0d1ee2b827d2230500 (can I do that if my name is on it?)",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9634#issuecomment-275280947,275280947,

I could replace these small changes with a backdoor over 90k loc, and keep your name in the commit. utACK I think very much needed and of course appreciat",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9634#issuecomment-275283117,275283117,

I don't remember the details exactly, but I wanted to verify that the tx was well-formed, and at one point I ended up with some garbage at the end that should've caused a failure but didn't.

laanwj,2017-01-26T08:48:34Z,"Concept ACK - DecodeHexTX can only output one transaction (data after it is effectively discarded, no pointer is returned to the tail data, etc), so it should only accept one transaction. I'd say if concatenated transactions are to be handled somewhere that'd need a function with an API that returns a list of transactions?",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9634#issuecomment-275335928,275335928,
sipa,2017-01-26T16:36:10Z,"I think only signrawtransaction takes as input a concatenated list of transactions, but it does not use DecodeHexTx, and does not need to deal with incomplete transaction (I haven't checked the code).",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9634#issuecomment-275437353,275437353,

TheBlueMatt,2017-01-28T18:47:28Z,"So I remembered why I needed this. If you call signrawtransaction with transactions concatenated which have different input counts, bitcoind might crash.
