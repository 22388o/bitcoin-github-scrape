gmaxwell,2016-12-10T19:19:25Z,Is the theory here that it will make it faster because it will move the getdata ahead of the 12 byte sendcmpt message?,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9315#issuecomment-266231063,266231063,
rebroad,2016-12-11T08:10:55Z,"@gmaxwell yes, although I prefer to look at the improvement in terms of milliseconds than bytes, and in mining terms that equals money. Then again if all the miners include this code then it's an improvement for no one :)",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9315#issuecomment-266269187,266269187,
rebroad,2016-12-13T03:22:13Z,"@gmaxwell Also worth bearing in mind that some implementations may round-robin the messages being processed from peers, so changing the order of the messages might mean being one place further forward in the queue for receiving blocks from such a peer.\n\nOh, and the sendcmpCt message is 33 bytes (including the header, 9 without the header), not 12.",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9315#issuecomment-266627766,266627766,
rebroad,2017-01-03T16:37:49Z,what am I talking about?! since #3180 the bitcoin core implementation round-robins the messages being processed from peers - thus this changing of order is more significant than I'd realised...,https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9315#issuecomment-270158243,270158243,
