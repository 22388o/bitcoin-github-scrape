    "body": "ACK de17d245b7462784f9d36591b0f346aa6b2e9b8c.\r\n\r\nI did shorten the `vcpkg` instructions when [manifests](https://vcpkg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/specifications/manifests/) were introduced. The idea being that `msbuild` would take care of calling `vcpkg` to install the dependencies automatically and it would be one less step.\r\n\r\nGiven that:\r\n\r\n - It seems to be recommended to still call [vcpkg integrate install](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/vcpkg-accelerate-your-team-development-environment-with-binary-caching-and-manifests/#using-manifests-with-msbuild-projects) even with manifests enabled.\r\n - At least one issue, #17864, has been raised with the Bitcoin Core `vcpkg` instructions.\r\n - Executing `vcpkg integrate install` should not cause any problems for manifests (although it's not clear what happens if different versions of a dependency are installed in the main `vcpkg` directory and the `manifest` directory).\r\n\r\nIt's an ACK from me.",
