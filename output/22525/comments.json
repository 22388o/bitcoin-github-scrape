Trying to then describe describe the actual behavior of when something is spendable I think is a futile task as it gets into the craziness of ismine. There's more to it than just private keys, scripts are also needed, and only certain scripts.\r\n\r\nEven in legacy wallets, it is possible to create a case where you should be able to spend a UTXO because private keys are available, but the UTXO is marked as not spendable.",

    "body": "> I feel like it would be better to explain what the consequences of something being spendable is rather than when the wallet would mark an UTXO as spendable. Spendable really means that the wallet will consider the UTXO for spending who performing coin selection and `include_watchonly` is false. Trying to then describe describe the actual behavior of when something is spendable I think is a futile task as it gets into the craziness of ismine. There's more to it than just private keys, scripts are also needed, and only certain scripts.\n> \n> \n> \n> Even in legacy wallets, it is possible to create a case where you should be able to spend a UTXO because private keys are available, but the UTXO is marked \n\nI agree the more accurate the text the better. My PR certainly makes an improvement on the existing text which is down right misleading. I do not have the understanding of the underlying functionality to add anything more useful here, if you have a suggestion I am all ears. ",
