Sjors,2019-08-24 20:51:12,"It turns out that applying the prune setting on first load was more involved than I thought. As part of the first launch sequence (or if you use `-resetguisettings`) it resets the `QTSettings` object. So you can't just do `settings.setValue(""bPrune"", true)` before the `OptionsModel` is instantiated.

Sjors,2019-08-26 10:18:22,"@emilengler I'd like to keep the intro screen as simple as possible, not overwhelm users with choices. It's easy to adjust the prune size in settings and the user has plenty of time for that during IBD.\n\nAlso note the diminishing returns for a larger prune setting. 10 GB protects you against a 1 month reorg if blocks are 4 MB.

laanwj,2019-08-29 14:04:01,"Concept and light code review ACK. Thanks for working on this. Haven't tested yet.\n\nMy only remark is that this makes the already monstrously complex and fickle GUI initialization sequence even more complex, by adding more possible paths, and punching holes for one-time settings. This is mostly concerning because there are no tests and also not really the possibility for them.\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16714#issuecomment-526200230,526200230,
